[noise] you said you're are fin- uh financial planner so do you work with individual um
like companies or i mean
so how do you handle your own account [laughter]
your your own budget [laughter]
hm [noise] right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and
well good [laughter] but we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on but we don't spend
um frivolously either
uh i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know it's not that rigid um
hm um i know though i'm expecting and um we're thinking about cutting down to one salary [noise] and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our
[noise] income because i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um
so i think when [laughter] when it comes to that time period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now we're struggling with it oh
[noise] the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and h- my husband's car is american mine's japanese but his is breaking down a lot more you know i haven't had any problems and were were
uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks
you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest
y- you know interest rate
[noise]
[noise] we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions
so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to
you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars
oh good [laughter] smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart
um
and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments
so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
and i- i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are a- uh
well that's in our goals i guess for this y- first quarter is to examine our financial
standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
[noise] oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a c._d. or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference
in the interest rate to make a different i mean [noise] to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than cds or or um
money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but
[noise] right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now
that
right
right
[noise]
yes
well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal
uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people
how do i handle my own account
uh well the first part of be- of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one don't have any debt
[noise] so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also
oh that's great you're ahead of most of the people out there then
[laughter]
uh-huh [noise]
well a budget does not have to be rigid
sure
um-hum
right
[noise]
[noise] well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results
and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not
and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it
uh-huh
well that is called smart budgeting
[laughter]
oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so
that is very smart to do
uh-huh
right
right
well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it
and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder
[noise] and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergenc-
[noise]
i'm bridgette
nice to meet you
i'm in lubbock texas
oh really oh my gosh
i know well are you ready for me to push one okay
[noise]
okay so what kind of cars do you like
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
what year is it
okay is it because that's what i have too
uh-huh i love it [laughter] i have a eighty nine
yeah it's a celica convertible and i love it [laughter] toyota makes great cars
really
[noise]
do you
yeah my fiance and i we've talked about it even and he has a um
a b._m._w. and they are s- [noise] expensive to just keep up and stuff
that we were both like you know if we're gonna get a new car it'd probably i would say it would be a toyota too
for sure
uh-huh
yeah i know
those are nice [noise] i think the next car that we'll look into will be more of a [noise] i don't know i think is it toyota 4-runner
is that what they're called something like like a or like a um
what are they called the one that [noise] the one that ford makes
the new ones do you know what i'm talking about
[noise] no they're kind of more like a truck like a bronco
type of [noise]
[noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah i haven't either
but i- i would think it would most likely be toyota
uh-huh
yeah me neither
really
uh-huh
um-hum
really
[noise]
uh-huh
really
but that's understandable
yeah
yeah
uh-huh i would definitely have to say toyota though that's the best car i've had
it's the best built
yeah i know
i know uh i feel like
i know i do too i feel like if if like ford or someone could make one that competed with you know i would buy it i would
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i think there's so much more economicable too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas
it's like
yeah
uh-huh
go a far way on that tank of gas [laughter] i know [laughter]
it's a g._t.
what is that
is it
um-hum
really my mom has a a g._t.s
she has a eighty nine g._t.s celica
yeah
yeah she i know she has this big powerful engine on she doesn't drive i mean she doesn't drive over forty
i know and the funny thing is because she bought it and i don't think the guy really i don't think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff on
[noise] -o
michael here
nice to meet you where are you
lubbock i'm in biloxi mississippi
yeah [laughter] not too far away [laughter]
yeah i guess so
well um i- i like i don't like real big cars i like fairly sporty smaller cars and uh i have a toyota celica right now
[noise] and um i- uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next that's that's sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another celica
um
it's an eighty seven
oh you have a celica oh really what what year is yours
eighty nine yeah
yeah
oh i do too
i do too yeah i think so too that's is the second toyota that i've had
yeah and um [noise] we've had it since it's new and uh that's what i- i plan on getting another one you know whenever the time comes
uh-huh uh-huh
[noise]
oh yeah yeah i know
uh-huh um-hum
what i would really like would be a uh supra but just ca- just can't afford that that's just a l- out of my ra- out of my range [laughter]
yeah
[noise]
um i've heard of it i'm not sure what it's what it is
[noise]
um
so a sort of sporty car
oh okay um [noise] oh other than the bronco i'm not sure i don't know what it is uh they have a new one other than the bronco you're talking about huh
no i don't know what it is i haven't even really looked at the vehicles much lately [laughter]
oh yeah i think i probably will too because i've had good luck with it never had hardly any problems
you know and the one i had before was the same way
yeah we had a [vocalized-noise] a uh tercel before this an eight two tercel
and that thing never gave us any problems
we had a wreck with it and uh [noise] the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that
but um uh i will i will say this uh the the celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it
yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them out because we live you know our area's fairly congested and a lot of traffic so it's
you know we use the clutch a lot [laughter] i do you're stopping and going a lot you know
oh yeah
yeah and uh i don't i'm i'm you know i don't worry about getting a japanese car you know everybody's talking about buying american and everything and
uh i just like the japanese cars i think i think they're better made [laughter]
that's right yeah
yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i- i g- i think the american cars they have the japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course
but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or th- that kind of a car i- i don't think there there's any competition really i think the japanese have them beat [laughter]
oh yeah sure i do too
um-hum
well i can too i'm um
i fill up maybe well i fill up about once every week and a half i'd g- i'd say
you know and uh i do a lot of driving right now i'm in school and everything so
um been doing a lot of extra driving but it's you know it's not bad not at all
we- [noise]
that's right that's right
well uh is yours the celica that you have is it a um [noise] an s._t. or a g._t. or what
g._t. mine is an s._t.
uh it's little lower model than the g._t.
yeah they had the s._t. the g._t. and the g._t.s you know and the the s._t. is the uh cheaper [noise] version of all three of them yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah that's got a little [vocalized-noise] little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so
yeah [laughter]
oh yeah well that's the way mothers are [laughter]
[noise]
okay
[noise]
uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months
yeah
well it's kind of hard to say uh because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years
we just
bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine
and uh
wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've got three cars of all things
so uh
probably
we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan
uh we have a a mazda nine twenty nine
and a ford crown victoria
and a little two seater c._r._x.
uh
it's rather difficult to to project what kind of
uh we'd
look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh
report or uh uh
repair records that the various cars have
and then of course we look into the prices
and uh
f- uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer
when
when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them
uh
long- a longer period of time uh i traded off a an eighty two oldsmobile for the eighty nine mazda
so
uh
uh yeah yeah we we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and
um
we we've had a good many foreign cars
and uh
the- the- uh i've been extremely we've had three mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our mazdas
yeah
yeah well we we've had uh
let's see we had uh
we had a uh let me think
we had a fifty three
and a uh
we had uh
two fifty threes which is a long thirty minute story [laughter] uh and we had a sixty five
and then we had this eighty two
so we we really can't complain about oldsmobiles
really
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
well uh my son over in shreveport uh sold porsches audis mada mazdas and volkswagons for ten years
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the mazdas
uh
so
uh
the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy seven m._g. m._g._b.
was british gr- racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top
and uh i drove it mostly
and
yeah it really was my husband was in the air force
and we got transferred to okinawa
so uh we had to sell it whi- which re- really tore me up [laughter]
because uh it w- it was great fun and then uh when we got to okinawa b- well we bought a second hand we uh
we decided that uh we had that s- uh sixty five oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the states and we got a little fiat
uh and a and the little uh forty horse power mazda four door sedan
[noise] okay
[laughter]
have you done this very long
yeah that's the same with us
well what kind of car would you buy
oh okay
uh-huh
okay
what kind do you have now
oh okay
uh-huh
yeah
oh uh-huh
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic
uh-huh
oh really
we've always bought american made cars mostly oldsmobiles
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah we've been real pleased with ours i think we've had one two three
and most we have a cutlass we still have a cutlass supreme which is like
a seventy seven
then we have a cutlass sierra and we've had a
ninety eight
so but i don't know we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and
the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they
give good financing through the
the motor company
but i don't know what we're going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty [laughter] so
oh
oh the
ooh boy
i bet it was hard to part with that
oh
oh yes
oh
[noise]
okay um have you had any experience in trying to find child care
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
really
okay well i've done more or less the same we have five children and um
uh yeah [laughter] i just haven't found it equitable to work outside the home and so i have done the day care inside my home
well i've done it for seven years and uh it's pretty well driven me crazy [laughter]
oh
[noise] oh was it oh
uh-huh that's true so- sometimes they do offer a just a play time for your kids
[noise]
uh-huh
[laughter]
hum
okay
oh my goodness [laughter]
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
[noise]
no no you don't
oh good
oh how fun
um-hum
oh good
um-hum
um-hum
that would be fun yeah that's good for the kids and then it's fun for you too to have that little break during the week
[laughter]
[laughter] oh now on that co-op um do women just trade baby sitting or
oh
[noise]
[noise]
oh
um-hum oh gosh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh what my goodness
uh-huh
um-hum
[noise]
oh
well that sounds like a terrific idea my goodness i haven't heard of anything like that out here in utah and it sounds like that'd be something good to start huh
[noise]
um yes some what um
we do baby sitting here like
my neighbor and i share baby sitting and um then i ran a preschool so i know you know from the other end you know trying to help people find
find day care so yeah
so what about you
[noise] goodness
[laughter]
um-hum
how has that worked out
oh
[noise]
yeah i can imagine i've got three kids and i think i mean
it's sometimes it's easier like last week my husband was gone and i had [noise] my three nieces and nephews over and it was really much more calm than than than having just my three at home
but yeah
yeah it it depends though it depends on how well behaved the other kids are yeah we have some times its like oh if i can only get these kids
um [noise] hang hang on just a second um
okay just a second i'm on the phone yeah i've got three preschoolers um but uh [noise]
yeah i mean i i think it's we've wanted to do i've wanted to join a baby sitting co-op
and um that's we there're several of them around here um
[noise] the one my my sister in law is in you have to be recommended in to
the co-op you know that way some one knows you and you and you just aren't giving your kids out to any body and i just haven't found one that's close enough to me
that i feel comfortable with at this point um
but because i mean you don't wanna you don't wanna leave with your kids with anybody and um
the day care centers around here i i really my kids go to preschool and i have found some really good ones um
one of them goes two days a week and the other one goes one day a week and that's a nice break and [noise] it's this is a
i really like the one that that they're in um they've got some really qualified teachers there they've been there for a long long time they've got um a
certified kindergarten teacher doing the curriculum for the older you know the fours and the three year olds and stuff so that's that is really good i really like that
yeah
yeah i like that i i like that little break oh [noise]
y- you you start out with like coupons and um i don't [noise] i think i think you start out like with say twenty or thirty and and you have to um
[noise] when when you baby sit somebody they pay you in coupons and then um
[noise] they uh then you pay the other people in coupons and i think some of them is in like thirty minute time slots or in hour time slots and you have to do it
you know per child um at least the the ones that i've seen that have worked and then they normally get together like once a month and um
to you know decide you know how many do you have and and then
they say okay you need to you know if if you're taking in a lot of baby sitting
and you're not you know doling it out also then um
a lot of times they'll say okay you need to you know you need to let people sit for you um that way it'll even out you some people aren't getting you know without they don't have any more coupons left
and um their monthly meetings the one i went to one and they a lot of times they'll have um special people come and talk about
uh say safety or you know different things with about children and some times they'll just have get togethers you know even even with the kids like during the day and stuff
so it gets them helps them to know one another and then you know its can be pretty informative also
[noise]
yeah
yeah i that's i don't know all the um i don't know all the details uh um i i i don't know if
it seems like it seems like her the my sister in law's um uh they are in
[noise] so how do you feel about the vietnam war
um-hum
yeah i saw that as well
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum [noise] well uh were you over in vietnam or
[noise] i'm i was much too young i was born in sixty seven so
[noise] um in a way both my well uh both my brothers were um draft age but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
uh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
[noise] well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there or
okay
um do you think i mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it
i totally agree with that
um well what what effects do you think it's had in our country
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum [noise] well i think i think that you know that's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed it wa- it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was it was such a gradual
and subtle you know the um you know increasement of of force that
um-hum
i v- vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something or -thing like that
oh well
um-hum [noise]
[noise] um
[noise] so um do you do you do you think that like our um [noise] for example like in in th- this past war the persian gulf war
that uh that [noise] you see it seemed to me that that bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um
you know prepare the country for war yeah
okay
[noise] uh i wasn't really keeping c- count but i guess that's good-bye
bye
[noise]
[noise] well um [noise] you know i guess that it's pretty deep feelings uh [noise] i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it good morning vietnam
and uh [noise] got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together [noise] the feelings i really appreciated the the little uh
[noise] english class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do a- you know the guy's goug- gouging your eyes out what are you going to do [noise] you know wait for him to finish me off
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of uh asian philosophy
that uh
[noise] no no i was kind of an in between uh finally drew a high draft number and you
oh
[noise] well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo i had a passport and was ready to go
or um uh out of the country or or join special forces either one
i mean i i- just didn't know [noise] so uh
um yeah just a second
you restrict access cause a lot of times people are trying to cut them out okay
sure now [noise] well mark um what was that again
no not not really
[noise] um
downside um [noise] uh [noise] well robert blythe says we should uh uh
[noise] yeah go into the grief that that's there and we're our presidents have always avoided that as a country so it's pretty serious really uh
a lot of things that aren't being addressed
[noise] yeah
gulf of tonkin uh resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo [laughter] things you remember that
yeah yeah only only it was foggy and [noise] pre- uh p- finally president johnson said well th- they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
isn't that something
um-hum
okay
hey mark uh i've got to go um we'll um see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you
yeah okay bye-bye
[noise]
well what do you think about how we've changed in the last ten twenty years
in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking
uh-huh
disintegrating
yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure
exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from
i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned
faxes and car phones and vcrs and all of that that make us so immediate th- there's no time for
relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that
oh yes [laughter]
um-hum
[noise] [laughter] exactly no patience
no attention span
these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer
with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a
is a a word that that suits most of america now we don't feel like we can in- you know influence anything
uh-huh uh-huh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and they're not going to let you through um
and it's a bad feeling
um-hum
um-hum
yeah go ahead [laughter]
um-hum um-hum
yeah then that's
um-hum the in- interdependence in a nice way
yeah i think uh i- i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it
uh but but but the community
however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and
i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but
you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know
um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or some- i mean something you know [noise] even offices have started sort of becoming the community
[noise]
yeah
um-hum and yeah
yeah
yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergener- generational
community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and i-
[noise]
i think it's pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um
well technology but also mor- morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be
for me that's the biggest change it's so frustrating um to see everything
[noise]
disintegrating and losing con- your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
i think you're really right i think like well even with computers um
you can there i mean there's so much that's happening in in that field and it
it just has forced us to go so fast and
um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know thomas hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and
and just describes the scenery and what's been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well let's get to the point and
yeah
yeah exactly
yeah you feel out of control
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
yeah it is it's really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are
disintegrating and stuff it's just a real
you don't have the the social networks we used to have to
to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving
you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do things you know in america it seems now it's independence is the thing and
you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything
whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and
you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of
you know when you're in trouble and you need so- you know someone to babysit the kids sure
yeah
exactly
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think i think because it's a necessity
as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i gue- that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um
temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know
[noise] so do you do a lot of camping
oh is that right uh-huh um
[noise] my sons are in the boy scouts also uh so i know they go a lot of camping but i don't go with them [laughter]
but uh we used to live in california and we did a little bit of camping in california not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping
oh who am i talking to
oh i can't believe that [laughter] well we can talk about anything [laughter] well
you know this is really funny because i i've tried to make these phone calls um whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we can't find another party and after th-
they say that two times i can't keep hanging on the phone and i just saw that card down there and now i'm really supposed to be baking bread for cistercian [laughter] i said oh i'll make another phone call i guess another five dollars helps [laughter] so anyway
oh we have to talk about oh that's right we're on this recording thing well anyway um we used to go camping out in california up by mendocino and um [noise] to um
[noise] uh lasson park which is a vol- a volcanic park and uh that was absolutely extraordinary and the rangers there that uh
do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was uh one of our uh major camping times that we enjoyed very very much
[noise] uh do you ever go camping outside of the boy scouts
oh yes
uh-huh
oh my
um-hum um-hum um
um-hum
oh that's true too
uh-huh
we took one canoe trip in california now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of webbie's that got this group together
and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um
i- i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the russian river yeah
yeah yeah
yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was webbie's first time doing this also and we just t- uh trusted in the uh knowledge of
this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our
life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just uh kind of uh
stayed by camp site and uh cooked [laughter] but it it was it was very exciting and
really very nice and um i wouldn't mind doing something like that again
and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you don't know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do [noise] but um
it it was quite an experience uh
um-hum um-hum yeah yeah so
[noise] oh yes well sean is daniel went last summer so
no no no he's not gonna go again this time but uh you're gonna inherit sean on this trip and uh um-hum
i know uh-huh have you been out there before oh you have- well daniel says it's i think it's really quite challenging
uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part
[noise]
[noise] uh well yeah a fair amount mostly with boy scouts
well mostly uh well boy scout camps near uh near dallas uh
i- in fact i i think i know your sons danny and sean right jan novak
but we can talk about camping none the less
they didn't
but we we should talk about camping because they're recording this
um-hum
well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids marie and i would go
we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate new york where there are a lot of lakes up near lake placid and in that area and in northern ontario which is also full of lakes
and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe
uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake
and so that that was a i i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you don't have to watch the weight so much
and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean
[noise]
and that's
what what river was that yeah i've s- i've seen the russian river we never went canoeing on it that that can get pretty fast
um-hum
um-hum
sure sure
yeah well you you have to be careful
you have to be careful
your your guys are going to philmont are they
agai-
right so danny's not going again
okay well i'll i'm going with them so
no
really
[noise] okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
oh [laughter]
oh goodness
uh-huh
oh goodness
so do they know what they're saying though do they seem to know the words that they're saying
because they're they're real young
yeah because that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh goodness
hm
um-hum
um-hum
yeah yeah they'll be because at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn
well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and
even though i had just gotten my master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and
i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really
paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because i miss working with adults and uh
you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language [noise]
right right and as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um
but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of
of set up for her so
um-hum
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the phoenix uh mesa area
oh okay
um-hum
oh yeah because now you're depending on other people that you don't know
uh-huh
yeah yeah
yeah
that's right yeah
and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure
[noise] so [noise]
that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around
uh-huh
[noise]
[laughter] well i've got two kids one of them_1's a year old and one of them_1's going on three
and in california anyways where i'm located my husband's in the navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here
they're either mexican or filipino and they don't speak english
so it's like my kids pick up really funny words
and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're saying
and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars
for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're saying
um
sometimes
yeah
like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know peter pan
but he said it you know in i- i don't even re- i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either spanish or filipino i'm not even sure which language it was
but he knew it was peter pan it's just he didn't say peter pan
and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying
but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it
it's just [laughter] makes it hard to understand
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences [laughter]
really
yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work
there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work
so we made a deal he's in the navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship
so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids
but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime
and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it
it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from arizona yeah really
[noise] mayer
yeah a little tiny dinky town up by prescott [laughter]
but um it's really strange because
i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and
it's really different here
yeah moneywise and you don't know them and you're worried you know
i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care
you know you always have that fear
i got to find somebody r- you know really that i can depend on
yeah
well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions [laughter] and that may sound kind of strange but
it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like [laughter] i want my child safe
[noise] so um do you have a p._c.
um-hum yeah one of my friends are into macintoshes i have a um p._c. my a i._b._m. p._c. myself
a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six
um
um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh
but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah
[laughter] yeah it's ju-
um i want it i want it you know well [vocalized-noise] i ju- i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a macintosh um
um-hum
yeah i use- that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e. in my high school
um-hum
um-hum
well do you use your computer for uh
just things around the house or in the in the
i see what do you do
oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um
are they are they based on on a on a um
other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach english you know through natural understanding
um-hum
well it was just uh when i was in high school i worked for the community school and they had a english second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know
spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i'd imagine so um
so um what were you doing when you were using an apple two e.
[laughter]
um-hum it it's ama-
yes it it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a trs eighty with four k. on it
and you know and then then i mo- and then i started playing with apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four k. you know
uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k. on them
is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight k. and there was only one computer that had forty eight k. on it at the time
and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure a- about um macintoshes but i know in ibm's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
you know that's that's your low that's the low end
um
um-hum
um-hum yeah imagine just to support
[noise]
yes i have a macintosh s._e. thirty
um-hum
what do you use yours for mostly
uh-huh
well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just uh today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to
send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
uh are you using windows
uh-huh
uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh [laughter]
um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an i._b._m. actually i used to use a just an apple two e. which of course is looks pretty primitive now
but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh mac right now i don't have uh any compilers
so i'm uh [noise] wa-
i use it in my business
i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh english as a second language programs
that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
um-hum
right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive
and then i use it for te- uh data analysis on testing so
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly [laughter] and with smaller files [laughter] i can't believe you know i've got uh
five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two e. i had a hundred twenty eight k. [laughter]
[noise]
yeah
oh the old
the old apple uh the the the original apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it
[noise]
my goodness
uh-huh [laughter]
[noise]
um-hum
well the s._e. thirty goes up to eight
but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
it's recycling
exactly i agree
well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be
there's not a market for it right
yeah [noise] well uh do you have a recycling program where you live
uh-huh [noise] do you have plastics and that kind o- kind of stuff
uh-huh
so this is like i- within the school
do they have curbside recycling
that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh
get that because i mean it's terr- it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all y- lug all that stuff you know dirty
you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door
well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some o- others won't
so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have
[laughter] i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible
but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper
but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases
but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle
and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable
so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it
yeah exactly
um-hum yep well anything else
well reduce reuse and recycle right [laughter]
[laughter] that's right i try to remember them i guess we've covered it
[noise] it was nice talking to you bye-bye now
[noise]
[noise] well uh i think it's a really good thing because um
of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste uh you know make them and then throw them away and bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them
and uh there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle
yeah you're right there but then there's things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one -ill
yeah
or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so
oh yeah uh i go to indiana university here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials
yeah and also the uh well the university's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff an-
yeah within the school and also the city here has uh
yeah monthly curbside recycling
uh-huh
right
right
right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own uh
uh-huh
right sounds like you are an avid recycler
are you
uh-huh
right yeah we do that at work too
right
uh-huh
right
well aren't there pop cans that are like that also
because they have mixed metals or something
-ell no not really
right [laughter] words to live by
[laughter]
okay
you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise] what do you think about drug testing
yeah yeah but
uh-huh
oh is that right was it a large or a small company
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
is that right
well sure i there's that part of it i think and
and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company
that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or
consumer products or whatever you'd you'd have an equal chance of being tested
i d- i don't know i just think it's a sick thing that we've come to that i don't like the way the world's going
well
does it i've heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive
and and that's what
what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs
or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive
uh no urine
yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate
but that's not what they're doing at my company
no it's urine samples i haven't been tapped yet [laughter] to do this
but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that
yeah well
[laughter]
yeah i- i suppose i suppose it's
it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind
you know everybody has databases these days
and they know a lot more about me than i'll ever remember i'm sure
yeah well i'm i'm certainly certainly sure that uh any drug test results would become a part of that
probably so
yeah
well i certainly believe in it for uh [laughter] people like airline pilots
or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers
uh-huh
oh sure
oh
yeah
huh
well i guess it would i guess so
well i don't know i [vocalized-noise]
i- i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i'm totally straight would never consider using drugs
but uh i- it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that you're innocent
on the other hand uh
i think it's pretty good i think they should do it especially in uh in companies where
uh you deal with uh either with other people or with uh stuff that uh
i want to say uh
deals directly with people's lives like hospitals and stuff [laughter]
um everywhere uh you know when uh when i was in college
when uh everywhere i- i applied a job for uh pretty much did a drug test because most of them were like defense contractors and stuff
except uh the the last job the job i actually took
they didn't care [laughter]
so
it's a big company it's uh m._c._i. telecommunications and i think uh they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that uh or run the heavy machinery but they don't require it for you know the engineering positions
yeah i was kind of surprised but
defense contractors only want you doing it because uh they don't want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you know
right
um-hum
um-hum
hum
right
um-hum
yeah i mean
yeah i mean i have i have no pro- i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff
and you know i- i don't know i guess it's bad you know to to go inside somebody you know hand them a urine sample bottle you know but uh
right right
right
uh-huh
well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair
they can uh
well can't they also test your hair
right right
oh really
[laughter]
okay well you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
well they uh i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if uh
you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company
tests positive
i mean i- i- i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again
and uh
test negative
and any way have time for that
wouldn't it [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going around
yeah that's true i guess they put it in your personnel file
yeah because i i'm i'm you know
i'm surprised they don't do it you know in uh in my organization
but uh
right
uh-huh yeah
train [vocalized-noise] and also uh uh
uh boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains
but small the uh small personal boats
they had trouble with uh not just substance abuse but uh alcohol abuse and stuff
and they had these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested an-
and they finally said no more alcohol out there
you know in uh like where i used to live in virginia
they had a lot of problems with uh with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and uh drug related incidents
so they finally just said uh if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to
so [laughter]
straightened a few people out
um
[noise]
um-hum well you know i'm the same way
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
[noise]
okay well um about capital punishment first of all i know that in uh texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess that's the uh preferred method have they used anything else
in in texas in your memory
i see
[vocalized-noise] oh [laughter] yeah that's that's kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the dahlmer case at all
that one's a little too grizzly too huh
um-hum
hum
i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well certainly for for someone like charles manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve
um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution
yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah
um-hum
um well [vocalized-noise] to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business
um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is
that i- i think two fold number one in los angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh [vocalized-noise]
in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there tru- uh people don't trust the cops who who uh
run the beat [noise] so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary
to keep crime down because
uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so
capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place
oh yeah as as uh
yeah
yeah exactly you know john john singleton who's who uh made the film um [noise] boys in the hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men
and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation
[noise]
yeah
i don't know to tell you the truth i don't follow it uh any more than i have to but i do know someone was just recently uh
put to sleep
exactly
ooh [laughter] no more tha- again no more than i have to um i have very mixed feelings about this whole issue um
uh i- i really don't like the idea of of uh death penalty ca- capital punishment however you want to put it
um and yet i do
concur that there are some people that have to be kept away
forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that there's nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me
i- i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if i'd really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed
i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed
you know there there have been been some criminals who said
and this is what i want and i can yeah i can see that side of it
uh because i don't know what life is like what what life means if you're in jail the rest of your life
um-hum
a a deterrent or righ- yeah
i'm not i don't know uh uh you know i don't think we've we haven't used it enough they say in in in countries where you know you're gonna have your hand cut off you know if you steal et cetera that
that it has that that there is less crime uh we certainly let our people out
way too fast i don't know i don't think i've got enough evidence on that what about you
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right and may be killed on the street anyway death is not that big a i mean one way or the other death is part of their everyday lives
i mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed you know that's a big deal
[vocalized-noise] but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up and walk to school
yeah
yes yeah
yeah yeah
that's right that that's right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to hand- i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on [laughter] pbs the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about
how wonderful our presidents have been because uh we've gotten this and that many more jails and [laughter]
[noise]
i'm bridget
nice to meet you
where are you
are you so am i where are you in texas
okay i'm in lubbock
okay are you ready for me to push one
okay
[noise]
so what do you think about capital punishment
uh-huh
um-hum
what do you think about jeffrey dahmer
like not getting since they don't have it in
yeah
yeah
i know because it's like it's kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowd- you know it's like problem upon problem upon problem
it's like you could put them in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded
you know and they add more problems
you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know
time to like one third of what you're supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous
yeah
um-hum
i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean
i think i'm definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has
no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know
uh-huh
right
yeah see i think that [laughter] [vocalized-noise] what is the point of that
[laughter] where did that come from
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's true definitely true
see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long
see
yeah i understand that
it takes prolong it forever
um-hum
yeah
[noise]
yeah the the
[vocalized-noise] yeah
see
yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was
you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know
and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know
i mean they should have like
god there's something so it'd be done faster you know because then they complain about the jails and the
this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb
m- mean at least if you're going to do it do it like because i mean that's like even torture kind of you know
yeah
[noise]
hi
i'm paul
pleased to meet you
i'm in texas
dallas
oh okay
sure anytime
well i think it's a necessary uh
a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly
uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent
yeah well i think that
i think there are certain
[noise] people in society that have no redeeming
uh worth to them and that it's i- it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be
you know disposed of
that's right
yeah
that's right i mean they probably you know we
the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed
as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other
well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is
it whe- when we administer it
by you know i- i mean like like in texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting
uh you know w- w- w- waiting his sentence
wh- wh-
there there's no point in it i mean
well it it's be- it's because
you know people don't wanna recognize
how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective
i mean it
punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good
the only reas- the only way it does some good is if it convi- convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that
and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody
because the courts require it
i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have cer- you know has to have the the the right to appeal well
but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate
well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate
technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong
and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that
yes that's right
yes
um-hum
it is it's terrible
oh i again i- i don't feel sorry for the for the for the victim that that's on you know for the for the criminal
okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh [laughter] yeah we know how that goes uh
with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation well that's fun so um
let's see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and
uh you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and [laughter] we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house
and that is so fun the kids just get a crack out of that
um we like we do like to go to the park too you like your family um
we don't do a lot of vacationing have you taken a lot of vacations together or
uh-huh and whe-
oh
oh now where do they live
oh so that's a bit of a drive for you then oh so you like to go there for the holidays and
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
oh uh-huh uh what are the ages of your kids then
oh yeah so you have some in the nest and some out huh [laughter] we have ours start at twelve and then they go down to four
so
[noise]
i bet yeah
um-hum yes uh-huh
yes and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored and and they want to and do something else so yeah i can i can relate to that
um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh um-hum
um-hum
um-hum [laughter]
that's good
oh good
um-hum
i think so and i feel like you know like president bush bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home
and so i i'm a firm believer in that too
um yes that's that's true well we see that a lot out here in utah and
um so hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh that's a good
[laughter] oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in texas or
very few you feel like you're in the minority [laughter]
oh dear [laughter] oh well out here in utah five is about the the average yeah
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh
oh i have some relatives out there in texas in fact my mom's out there in texas right now in dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and
well uh no i'm trying aberdeen
it is that close to dallas oh don't you it's i gue- guess it's out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and
[noise]
oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park
um [noise] some time watching v._c._r. movies
um generally cheap things [laughter]
that's right
[noise]
yeah
most of our vacations are to go and see grandma and grandpa we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa
in arizona
yes
oh we don't go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays
and let grandma and grandpa come and visit us
they range from twenty four to five
that's right how old are your children
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together
with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it
and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and
yeah
i think it's improving actually
we had an interesting experience the other day we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on sunday and we just kind of keep them at home
and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game saturday and our next door neighbor was there
somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend [vocalized-noise] saturday night at their house and she said no sundays our family day [laughter] and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction
and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
[noise]
yeah
i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something so
[noise]
[noise]
utah's a lot better than texas
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
very few
yeah
oh definitely when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense but uh
[noise]
average yeah my wife and i were in utah until i guess we were about twenty four
and we've never been back since then but we have kids up there now so we get up occasionally
where where in dallas
hum
i don't have any idea i've never heard of it must be a little town
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
well i don't know how you feel about drug testing but i'm dead set against it
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah um i think about the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or v._i._v. war on rights is uh pretty much your libertarian candidates which
um i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get e- elected
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because um
the um u. .s department of labor whatev- i'm not sure might be a different agency requires um businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of the things it posts is
um on the ille- illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are
well it means that that that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that
oh i mean i don- i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being i don't understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous
character
um-hum
um-hum [noise]
oh yeah
yeah
yeah and and you know i i agree with with a lot of people that you know claim instead of [vocalized-noise] having random drug tests for continuing employment have um motor impairment tests um because you know the they they would not be any more pr- they would they would
be similarly priced um and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before
and you know he has that on his mind and isn't gonna be able to function properly you know i i just as you know i'd i'd almost as mu- you kn- have as much uh fear of him driving the bus i'm riding than
yeah yeah or maybe more yeah [laughter] i'll show her
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and al- and also on the question of you know just getting employment i'm you know i'm i'm a senior in college and i'm applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain um
non uh sanctioned um hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is is just um moving away moving away from
you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which uh you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and l._s._d. which you know one they don't test for well l._s._d. they don't test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week
and i used to snort i just you know wonder what effect this is having you know
um and i and i mean that's you know that's entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but
i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there there's
[noise]
well so we can have a conversation on on agreeing with one another today right because we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us
change the the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with people's personal life
well that's always a problem i have to admit that that back when uh the texas governorship
race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with ann richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue
for self decrimi self incrimination kind of thing yeah
yeah yeah because the the tests are equally unreliable and
personally i don't even think it's a question of whether they're reliable or not i mean it doesn't matter how reliable they are then i think that it's inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody who's
getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are
currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance
okay
[laughter] or maybe more [laughter] well you know if you stop and think about it
stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well you're absolutely right
you're absolutely right uh
uh it certainly sounds that if if that's what college students are doing that that's anti productive
yeah
well that of course there's really there's really no way to know uh it's [vocalized-noise]
i just you know unfortunately i've i've talked with a um
some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husband's in a job situation that um
makes him
subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place
and uh you know not that he does it not that he's ever done it you know i mean he's he's one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with
you know with any of the rest of it he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control so he doesn't
so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life
[noise] i'm bridget
yes
what are you doing
i'm just sitting here trying to
eat bread before i go to a meeting [laughter]
no i'm in lubbock
yeah what are you doing are you at the office
where are you
are you
cool
i know like listen to us we're like trying to volunteer
okay are you ready for me to push one
do we know what we're going to say
yeah okay i'll push one
[noise]
okay so what do you think about crime in the big d.
are you
um-hum
i don't know i think in dallas it's a lot more scary just because it's a big city i mean in lubbock and stuff i know lots of people that don't lock their doors or you know leave their windows open at night because it's so much smaller i mean it feels safer
and i know that it happens here but it's not near like it is in dallas
people are more trustworthy i think
people have reason to be i guess
yeah
i know lots of people that'll leave their doors open you know if you have to go get something like
get a book or something from their house you can just walk right in
they're always unlocked or something and
i mean
see i know and there're only like certain
you know neighborhoods up in lubbock that are that you wouldn't leave your doors unlock- you know
but besides that i don't know it's fairly safe i think
really
yeah
yeah
dallas can be pretty bad though
i think it depend on the city really
i don't know though because i think that way of lubbock and then uh
like i was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country and she was saying how bad it is out there and i would think it would be less
i would thinking it wouldn't be as bad
see i know i know that's scary
i don't know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what
i was like no way and she goes yeah she goes you know people get broken into a lot because they you know it's real easy to get away with there you know no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby
i was like well that's true but besides that
i don't know and i think it's just getting worse
uh-huh
i know
see i know
yeah that's true
because you have neighbors and stuff at least you know
i know someone's got to
i know that's scary though
and it just keeps rising
i mean i can't imagine
i don't know what's after i've been here so long it's like i well you'd have to pay me to move back to dallas
i mean i don't like n- now that
i'm away from it and i can look back at how you know dallas is and stuff yeah i don't like it
i don't like it at all really
i don't know i think it'd depend on
i don't know where you live i know that's not right though i think that but i don't think that's really
yeah
yeah
really see that's sad i would think like car theft is a really big thing
wouldn't you
i think that or
i know i know
see i know
i don't know because that's
i think ca- i don't know if that is though that's what that'd be my guess car theft for sure
because i don't burgalies burgurlaries i can't say that burgalies i don't know i don't know if there'd be that
i don't know besides people that would be just have like kids that come in and burglarize and take like tvs and stuff that they could sell real easy whereas someone like cleaning you out you know
i guess that would depend on it too
uh-huh
no way
oh my gosh
i'm m- melissa brigette moore
nothing [laughter]
are you in dallas or lubbock
oh are you
how funny [laughter] huh
i'm at home
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
about crime
okay
well
i'm worried about my car [laughter] because i just got a new car and
so i'm worried about it
getting stolen or anything happening to it at all
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i don't know i don't it doesn't matter where i go i lock my doors [laughter]
so
[laughter]
gee i don't think i'd ever do that if i wasn't at home
yeah
god even up in like highland park i don't even think i'd leave it open seems like that'd where they'd really go for the big houses
hum
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i guess it just depends because there're certain part of the cities too there's no way i would ever i wouldn't even leave my car alone in south dallas
[laughter]
[laughter]
um
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's what scares me about living out in uh like off in the country i used to live out in the country
and that kind of scares me because i think
you know you always hear about all those murders and it's weird to think about but it happens [laughter] and that's the scary part
and i don't like living out in the country i like living in the city where i'm close to there might be more crime or as they say but it just makes me feel safer because i'm around someone
yeah if i scream someone's going to hear me [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
hum
yeah
i don't know i guess i'm sure there is
a bunch of thie- of thieving going on in lubbock it's just not around you or not that you know of
because i don't know i mean uh a couple of summers ago the people behind us got robbed
and
you know we were everybody was looking out but ever since like a week after that nobody just even paid any attention any more
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
especially here where we have so many cars
everybody in new york takes a cab and we've all got cars
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah a friend of mine's house he was gone all summer but he has a house here by himself
and um his own friends got in and robbed him
yeah he has this he has this like gorgeous bedroom set and that's th-
[noise] okay liz do you have any children
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh well we have five children and [noise] uh their ages ran- from range from twelve to four
uh yep [laughter] and uh
uh some things we like to do together with our family are um in the summer time we like to go to parks we
that's our thing we pack up a picnic and and go to every park from northern utah to southern utah [laughter]
well mostly mostly just play parks yeah so
um with the with the kids and such we don't get a lot of vacationing in so we just like to take little weekend trips and go to parks and such
so
oh uh-huh
yep when i was a teenager i spent some time with my cousins in dallas
and so i i remember it's pretty [laughter] it is flat oh
uh-huh
[noise] yeah
well we like to
weekends um
no we're not into skiing it's just too expensive we
we can't do that so [laughter] um we like to uh rent videos and sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and
and do that so we've done that quite a bit this winter and um we like to play board games together sometimes it's a little difficult with the younger one um
but the three older boys we have some fun times with those after the little girls go to bed
and let's see uh we like to get real wild and crazy and play hide and go seek and [laughter] oh yeah things like that
oh yes
yeah yeah he's really patient though he with us he's he's a real fun twelve year old so
but he's rapidly approaching teenagehood so we'll see what happens
yeah uh-huh [laughter]
oh
oh boy [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
oh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh [laughter]
oh
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh how fun
[laughter] oh
oh i think that's fun [laughter]
oh
oh
yeah
yes i think that is good that sounds
uh-huh
now were you able to get away on some vacations and
oh oh how fun
oh
oh how fun
uh-huh
oh wow [laughter]
[noise]
i do but they're but they're both out of college so i have one who's uh living in an apartment in another city
and i have one who's actually living with me because um because of the economy and the job that she's got but she's about
[noise]
she's on the verge of moving to her own apartment so what about you
uh-huh
oh little ones then
yeah
wow oh you mean like state parks that kind of
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just uh we have a different terrain here so
uh
um-hum
it's flat [laughter]
yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to to find any there are some as a matter of fact but um what other things do the kids like to do
like weekends or during during during the winter do they ski or
it is expensive yeah
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah that's fun
yes that's
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter] all of those things yeah
well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in in their minds in at any rate yeah
well that's good
uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
[laughter] your first experience with it well it um it's interesting [laughter] there's a dramatic change at thirteen and it doesn't end -til about twenty five but
[laughter] it's part of what's supposed to happen or they can't fly the nest so um tha- that's one way of looking at it
[laughter] anyway i was trying to think what what what we spent a lot of time well reading i loved to read to the kids when they were when they were younger uh obviously not any more but
and uh we still we
like um disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and um
ironically uh my twenty sev- my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for christmas we rented um jungle book you know
and uh i gave one of them jungle book and one of them fantasia for christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts so
[laughter] so that's something um besides the [noise] another thing we used to do is watch pbs together which there were a lot of um my son loves science programs and um
we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on
yeah which was which was fun yeah and so
yeah we did and um and we enjoyed that um my now we my kids back when they were y- younger got did we would go from here to like colorado and ski
and they did both uh learn to be scuba divers
uh we went once on a vacation with my parents
to an island and they snorkeled and that that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of missouri as we were living in kansas city then
and uh went and i don't can't remember what it's called uh but it's
[noise] uh well it's nice to talk with you um
oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to [noise] uh
to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um
uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress
uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the
the willpower on their own to uh
to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh
i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district
yeah that's exactly right
[noise]
yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh
uh uh you wouldn't be able to um
put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that
and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute
and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen
uh because no one
uh
uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing
i agree
um-hum
yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh [laughter]
and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh w-
gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending
and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy
how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from europe and the far east and letting germany and japan defend themselves
yeah
well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas
that's right
um-hum
yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid
[noise]
i agree with that [laughter]
local politics yeah
well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together
uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the l- yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
there's another i- uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects
too often uh those are uh not there's no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with
billions of dollars of overlay
or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be
for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way
and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh what's being uh spent and more accountability that would help enor- enormously too are
how who or how that would come about i'm not uh sure but that's an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at
well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs
uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the [noise] the military's a big uh
area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i- i do not see the point of having four different services
uh i do not see why they could not have one military service
that's right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments
uh
basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that
uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh
or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a
no well wit- witness the the recent gulf war too even with uh troops all over europe uh it took several months to gear up
and so what was the point of having them to begin with
[noise]
okay um what does your does your community do anything about recycling
um-hum
um
um-hum
right
plano um
oh it's probably been i guess i started in september um
started where they gave e- every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code one and two on them
and uh glass and uh it has been really really successful um
they said that they figured like twenty five to thirty percent participation and it's been like forty five percent and um they also do um
they pick up on another day of the week for um
lawn debris that could go in like a big compost
um-hum
right
right
how big is your community
yeah
um-hum the i yeah that's i- i would like to see the manufacturers really uh
you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics one and two and i would like to see them recycle either more
plastics um you know up to code seven or eight whatever it is or see the manufacturers using
more of the um
uh code one and two that i- i mean i don't even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones
but um
we're recycling newspapers aluminum
um i mean like aluminum cans like soup cans and all that not just you know soda pop cans um glass and uh the plastics
right
it sure does take a lot of lot of cans to do that that to make anything though at least down here it
i- i took like two garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like a quarter and i thought this just really isn't worth my time
so [laughter]
that that go through the dregs yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
that's great
yeah
yeah really
really
we w- i know uh even before this took place um in september
the our like our boy scouts were doing pa- you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so
i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago i'm not sure
but i know now i m- we have a lot of um
stores [vocalized-noise] wal-mart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of compa-
[noise]
we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going
the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic
but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet
here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more
we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but
i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they
you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular
well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand
but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving
um di- di- did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers
boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans
uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side
yeah it really is but there are a few people who who
they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church
and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then
uh take them to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food
and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church
but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling
places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them so we're stuck with newspapers
[noise] okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home
and what kind do you have
[noise] oh
uh-huh
uh-huh [laughter] well we have a cat um he's probably
oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
[laughter] oh uh how's the disposition of your siamese cat
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason he's uh
been so mean to her [laughter] and
we've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her
um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and
and declawed and now he bites her he can't scratch her anymore he bites her
yeah yeah he has a couple of times so
but he's a very
possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog
he won't even let my son shower he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious
so he's quite a animal [laughter]
[noise] yeah [vocalized-noise]
yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so
so aggressive towards the girl but
uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so
[laughter] were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house [laughter]
it is uh-huh we've we tried a dog um about four years ago and we ended up with a
oh malamute and
some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so
we gave him up
and tried
yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was unfortunate
so have you tried any other pets [vocalized-noise]
oh [laughter]
oh
uh-huh
oh my word
oh my word
and do they they just paper train it or something [laughter]
yeah [laughter] well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them trained otherwise they're pretty smelly [laughter] um
huh-uh we don't have c- we don't have cable
oh
oh
is that right oh
uh [laughter]
uh-huh [laughter] well that would be interesting to watch
yes uh-huh elton we live [noise] out here by it's by ogden it's north of salt lake city utah
and we really love it out here it's uh
kind of country we're we're only about ten minutes from ogden
so we're kind of country but not too
not
no huh-uh do you
oh well see i'm getting so many calls to texas
oh well great yeah i've been doing it for about two weeks and uh no my
[noise]
yeah i do
i've got a male siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh
except for the cat [noise] how about you
uh-huh
well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature
and uh he's been neutered and declawed so and he's an indoor cat so uh
uh that kind of calms him down for the most part and uh
how about yours
huh
and and you say you had him how long
two years
huh
does he bite her enough to draw blood
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah
yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something
uh-huh
sure
yeah yeah
is that the only pet that you have
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh
yeah
i see
sure
no no i- i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good
you know i- i saw something on c._n._n. or on cable here uh
a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments
and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in uh [laughter]
i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because uh
yeah
yep that's right
did you see the the c._n._n. the the dog show uh
they
i see well they have uh
uh a westmin- they call it the westminster dog show uh uh i think it's in new york city at the at the gardens there once a year live
and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever wanna see on there some of them are really beautiful too [vocalized-noise] yeah so
yeah
so you live in utah do you
goodness
uh-huh
uh-huh
well
do you all work for t._i. or or
yeah yeah yeah
this is the very first one i've i've talked to you know
uh-huh
[noise]
i pre- i pressed one all right uh on uh
benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation
i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh there's a little more in backup when i need it
do you work outside of the home
oh
that's a pretty large corporation
um-hum
no yeah
yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around
um-hum
yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one
um-hum
well i think uh course i'm i'm a medical technologist and and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find
because um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh
of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations
do you have good resources in your school district
yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place
um is how about you how do you feel about that
um-hum
whole ball of wax
what would you like to change in your benefits
um-hum
yeah
do you have to pay
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well ours is
well it's it's difficult [laughter]
i know uh ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but
the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic
so that's how i'd like to improve ours
oh well you have to
uh-huh you have to if you're smart
hum-um
um-hum
well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and
yeah and that's that's kind of rough
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah it happens
yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise
um-hum
i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire
because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it
yeah it was uh
it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
all right
benefits
yes i do i work for the school system richardson school
yes it is and uh retirement's one of the good benefits
and um health care has been a mess
and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think that's a mess for everybody now isn't it pretty much
it keeps i
yes for the best where it used to be one of your be- you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didn't have that problem
yes i think i do i've never worked for a small one so i can't tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system
right
um
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right right
right we do have very good resources they're excellent
and they're
well it's an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect
as far as um
being having having everything available to you
the uh counseling and the whole
um um-hum
right
well probably the major one would be the medical
i would like to ch- see a better package for the money you know i- bu- but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the
medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you don't get any of that any more you know it's all separate and it's all so very high if you do get it
and that's very frustrating and it i can't imagine how the younger families do it
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i wa- i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and it's not good though we've had to i mean we're building our own you know
you have to any more you can't count on companies on that any more that and that's another thing that's changed the the medical and the
retirement benefits from large corporations it's kind of it's it's like it was set you know you were really set for life really
uh uh-huh
yeah ye- yep that's righ- right before
[noise] that's yeah i remember um
my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and that's what they're doing again it's like a recycle of the whole
when they see they're gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or it's getting close to a time
they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to pay as high and
oh [vocalized-noise]
i do too and the wisdom behind it all it's yeah and you know that's got to cou- that's got to add in all their production the whole works
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well it's cost again
you know cutting cos-
[noise] okay uh
yeah it's clint uh-huh
right [laughter] is it a hobby for you or do you get serious about it
do you have a lot of nice tools table saws things like like that
do you do any remodeling of your house or what kind of woodworking do you enjoy
hum
yeah
the the big stuff's what i do the the stuff you do is the the [vocalized-noise] work um [noise] working with hardwoods and and stuff like that is i i'm lousy at that i mess it up every time [vocalized-noise]
no no no even that that's that's i still mess up when i um i guess i really don't do much actual wood working uh
[noise] i do a lot of carpentry stuff um uh finishing basements and rooms and things of that nature but it's
[noise] i- i do do a little bit of finish carpentry but not very much i don't not very much not not like the stuff that you're doing
um [noise] when i took shop classes in high school it was a lot of fun using the lathe and doing some fancy stuff with that course you can't mess things up on the lathe hardly
but uh
uh-huh
i'll bet
was it hard woods you were using in it
uh-huh
uh-huh
and make it look nice it is
uh-huh
uh not at all not at all no pine and redwood and like i say i'm i'm really not a uh carpenter per se i'm a
or a wood worker i'm a carpenter i guess is and i'm really not even a carpenter i just but i enjoy it i do a lot of it
[vocalized-noise]
it it's tou- uh tough to make a living isn't it
do you sell any so you do do some sales when you
um [noise] do you do cabinets too
uh-huh
[noise] is it hard wood when you use when you what kind of hard wood do you use
[noise] that plywood that's got the oak uh do you use that a lot where it's just you know what maybe a quarter inch or even thinner than that possibly piece of oak that's on the outside do you use that a lot
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
and then they just have an oak face on them
are they ready to uh
i guess finish or do you have to do anything
yeah
um-hum
do you have a workshop or are you using the garage or
[noise] and your wife puts up with that
uh-huh huh
um
expensive you can get a lot of money in that kind of stuff especially the good stuff
ai- uh ai- uh air pressure
huh
i- i- is it electric or air
um
um
how mu- how much does that cost you
is that right gee and that was just for the gun that wasn't for the compressor any-
[noise]
it's clinton right
clint okay
as in clint black right
[laughter]
um i'm pretty serious it's a serious hobby i guess
um i'd like more but yeah i'm getting up there i just have a used table saw right now i'm looking at getting a better one but it's just an old sears craftsman
uh mostly fine woodworking furniture type stuff um enjoy the children's toys
i like making those
so it's basically smaller stuff
have you done much big stuff
right
[laughter]
you do kitchen cabinets and stuff
uh-huh
finish finish carpentry or
uh-huh
no
yeah i got a i just finished a project one of those um swinging cradles
and i turned all the spindles for that and that took a long time but it was pretty fun
yeah oak
that's really hard to turn
but
yeah
had to fill a lot of chip marks up but
it really chips really easy
do you work with oak much
not at all
uh-huh
yeah that's i tried it for a job once and
it's just not for me i like it as a hobby more
boy it sure is i just enjoy making gifts and
doing small stuff on the side
yeah yeah once in a while i'll sell some um custom custom type wood work if they're willing to pay the price now
i used to get ripped off all the time because i spent way too much time on them
um i'm starting to i used that's what i did for a job one summer i made some cabinets for a junior high school and but i haven't done a lot of them
i use oak face frames and then just plywood for the box
the yeah the just on the outside where it shows yeah just slip it into a groove that you make on the face frame
and then you can just slip that in there it's a lot cheaper of course quarter inch and three quarter inch aren't much cheaper than each other
of plywood
but
yeah just a
for to the plywood yeah i just finish sand it just like with one fifty
and then you can finish it up
so
um just the garage i wish i had a workshop but the stuff i do i- i don't need a lot of room for it
uh she puts up with me buying the tools [laughter] she likes wood she likes me wood working but
getting the equipment i want sure is taken a lot of years i started when i was about sixteen buying my own equipment
and i only need a few more things like a joiner i'd like to have and small some smaller things
oh man everytime we
yeah i just bought a a sprayer to finish my project um a high volume low pressure sprayer
it's a high volume low pressure they're new sprayers that are coming out
really little over spray
it's air it only sprays with three p._s._i.
but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that's what
that's what gives you your thrust of your paint
um do you do [vocalized-noise]
it was five hundred bucks [noise]
[laughter]
[noise]
well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh
there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
right
right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance george bush is offering
yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a coke or something for that
yeah
nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either uh
i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the democratic candidates uh don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could
do something to affect our budget at this point
i believe it was dukakis but i i can't
yeah i mean that's better than george bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh
that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of x. number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know whe- where that money is actually gonna go because
in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend
i mean if they could actually pu- put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works
projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
right ex-
exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infra- structure of the country
yeah and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
[laughter]
so am i
uh i._u.
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
right
you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington
yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
oh no
uh-huh
for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again
and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference
no no not at all
no
[noise]
[noise]
um-hum
yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it you know
no
it the ninety seven cents a week [laughter]
uh-huh
hell i mean mostly you know it's it's not actually a a a cut it's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know
um yeah i don't just don't see it changing my life style a whole lot
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it mondale or dukakis that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm gonna raise taxes
it was dukakis yeah i have a lot of respect for him
yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
oh yeah [laughter] i know it it's
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
oh yeah i i yeah i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly
and it
[noise]
yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we we've we've hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fi- fifty years of the cold war yeah
um-hum
um-hum um yeah i i agree totally [laughter] um
i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i i'm in college right now and oh really where do you go
right i go to georgia tech um and in my i had poli- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago
and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situa- how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eigh- in the um tax year of eighty one um
ronald reagan basically said you know
i'm gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um
that the congress would not in the right mind pass and con- congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the democratic congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know sli- by by removing the tax cut
further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know wha- created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
and you just [noise] i mean it's just
i mean it's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun
yeah
um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes
and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
i mean it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have
you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah that i mean i don't know i i [laughter]
i don't i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety seven cents a week
well i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive
[noise]
so martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said you're from atlanta
um-hum
um-hum
i mean do you f- do you find crime in atlanta really bad i mean i live in atlanta also
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
um-hum
i'd probably agree with that
uh
um-hum
yeah that's probably true um
so d- um well do you think atlanta is as bad as most other cities
um-hum
um-hum i don't think it's as bad as l._a. either
we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you kn- trying not to look like a victim
you know
you know walk wi- you know walk with you know with
well [laughter] not silly just walk you know confidently and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in atlanta
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't
yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
oh really
wow where was where where was that was that downtown or
really
um-hum metropolitan yeah
yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen
um
and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to
the a._p._d. seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair [laughter] up on blocks you know my friend who had a um
v._w. rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat [laughter]
um-hum
well you're probably luckier than
um-hum
um
so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body
oh [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
so how do you know this much about um stealing cars
[laughter]
[noise]
right i- i- i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh
you know for my own safety
oh that's right um
uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in it's not
uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's ce- certain areas where uh the crime is focused um
well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility
and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount
and probably um
they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is
yeah
you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects
uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top
top ten in terms of crime
um
it's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example probably not not as bad as detroit
no
yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like new york city and
you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious
yeah that's true
with a big stick or
[laughter]
right
sure [vocalized-noise] right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that um and and then you're kind of
on your own [laughter]
uh no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted
but that was in a more of a
a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got [vocalized-noise] i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really
and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
i've had that happen but that's that's about it
oh yeah
hum
really well i've had my
um-hum i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts
yeah
oh no that was in the northern pa- um up near cumberland mall area it's actually cobb county but it is atlanta
and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area
right yeah
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it
so i got it back
yeah
than most
right it it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
yeah you've got to you crack the steering column then you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these g._m. cars and you can st- start it up basically pretty easily
[noise]
well after i found mine i had to i had this
[noise]
okay now it's sandy right
sandy um what kind of music do you like to listen to
uh-huh
in san diego uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh
do you oh
oh um now have you lived in california all your life
no you just moved there
oh
now where's home
oh okay so country music is prevalent in arizona
is it oh
oh
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh how fun oh
oh gosh i don't blame you uh my husband's in the navy reserves and so he's going out to san diego in about three weeks for his two week
yearly stint so
i'll be missing him then but [vocalized-noise]
oh and how long does he stay out
oh
oh well thank goodness
uh-huh
oh i think that's terrible oh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh
uh
uh-huh
oh boy [laughter] so he is real country now
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] uh that is that is well out here in utah we have a lot of country and we live kind of in the country it's by ogden utah i don't know if you know salt lake city
oh yeah well it's it's about a hour north of salt lake so we're out here in the country and we hear a lot of the country music
in fact i work in a bakery and the baker comes to work at four o'clock in the morning and i come to work at six o'clock in the morning
and he just has the country music just a blasting and he just rocks and rolls in the bakery [laughter] to country music [laughter]
oh [laughter]
i- i bet that's really hard being their alone with all those with the two little ones
way it's a way of life for a while huh
yeah that's good
well um my favorite kind of music is new age and it's that sounds like it's hard rock and roll but it's not it's the
oh the synthesize- synsi synthesizers and all of that
uh-huh and it's just beautiful i love it i
i find it so relaxing and i do i'm ge- beginning to like country music more and more since my boss has it on all the time but um
but my very favorite is that new age i like my favorite recording artist is yanni and he's not he doesn't make you yawn [laughter] he
um i have yeah i've heard of her in fact i was watching the grammy's and i i saw her on the grammy's
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah she's not too wild
oh [laughter]
oh
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh
oh
oh oh
[laughter]
[noise]
all right
yeah
i like country and it's really hard to find people that enjoy country music
in my age
because i'm twenty two and most people my age like hard rock and
not me [laughter] i think it was the stupidest thing ever invented
i still like country music and
so it's kind of hard for me to find people i agree with on music
oh no
[laughter]
i- i have to be here right now because my husband's in the navy
but i'm going home first opportunity i get
arizona
oh yeah i- i was born in a little tiny town that that's all they have [laughter]
it has a population of about three hundred people and all they know is country music
i mean they still have barn dances and stuff [laughter]
yeah it is pretty fun
oh really
[laughter]
yeah my husband's leaving march twelfth he has to go out to sea again
so
well usually they stay out six to nine months but this time they're only going out for i think it's two weeks this time because they're just they're just doing their sea trials making sure they're ready to go out to sea again
yeah it gets kind of monotonous
but i incorporated him into country music because he didn't he didn't like it when we got married but since he married me and i was the country girl that's all i have going on at home
so now he's gotten where he really likes country music and for my birthday he went out and he got me a brand new pair of tony llama boots and he bought himself a pair too and took me out country dancing
yeah and all his friends tease him on the ship
are you sure cowboys know how to swim
[laughter]
he he gets upset about it but it's funny
my my dad lives in salt lake
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah i know how that goes i think country music's the only thing keeping me sane with these kids
yeah
yeah it is but
i don't know it's worth it
it's worth it to me
yeah and it kind of has a bluesy mix to it yeah
[laughter]
yeah
do you know who mariah carey is
i don't particularly like her kind of music but she's got a couple songs that i i i can listen to
you know without going totally bonkers
[laughter]
yeah but
i don't know i just i guess i'm kind of the only country one that got left [laughter]
because most people here most of the bars and everything are either hard rock or disco or um just a blues bar we've got several blues bars in the neighbor- neighborhood
and it's like uh guys what happened to juke boxes and sawdust on the floor you know
and i- i asked that of a i went into a bar with my husband on our anniversary and i asked the guy i said have you ever heard of a a juke box and he goes yeah
i said why don't you install one he goes what music do you want on it and i said country and he goes no way i'd lose all my clients and i'm like thanks [laughter]
ever had a family reunion
um do you do extended families or
yeah
[noise] yes um in the last couple of years i've the last one we had was in september and um i helped plan it so and it was here in dallas so um
but um
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
oh wow yeah that [noise] we've done um
we went to one that was my husband's grandfather and his brothers and sisters and then their families so we that was kind of nice i don't know that they had done one um in a long long time and so
it was real nice to get to to know other people than his just aunts and uncles
and so that was really fun and um we did that in florida but there were still only maybe oh seventy or eighty people there but they did they did a lot of um
we had we had several get togethers like saturday was or friday night we started with dinner
saturday we had lunch together and took like family pictures and went over family history and then um
that night we had some free time in there and then that night was um
oh it was more it was a it was a nice dinner and then they had you went around the room and said who you were and maybe something about yourself and
you know how you related in the family and stuff and that was kind of nice because we'd been talking to these people all day long and then it was okay now where do you fit in in the in the line and stuff and who's who's are you kind of thing
but um
um-hum
um
yeah
yeah
yeah there're six in my family and i don't i don't think of them as family reunions so much but ei- either thanksgiving or christmas where for sure
everyone is there and and uh so that's you know by the time you get the kids and all that there's there's a good number of us there and um
but we usually just eat and and play games and you know chitchat but um we had a
my grandmother's side of of the family we had a get together last year and that was really fun because
uh uh as cousins we stay real close together and um s- but we did things like um
went to the tea we went and had tea at the um oh one of the hotels downtown in downtown dallas and then
[vocalized-noise] friday night i- if you wanted to go you could go to the mesquite rodeo
and then saturday it was we had a big family picnic and we had t-shirts that you know said family reunion and ha- gave the year and um wore those to the picnic and we had some stuff for the kids and there was a [noise]
it was there was a wading pool there that if the kids wanted to go swimming they could do that
and if the guys wanted to go golf they could do that and stuff and then saturday night was our big big dinner and and we had it catered and it for most of the part it was catered and
it was really nice to be able to se- we sent out stuff this is this is what's available to do and i- i- you know the big family dinner is going to be saturday night
you need to make a reservation and pay us ahead of time because the year before we had done it and uh had had problems getting
you know the the yeah i mean it's like pass the hat around and [noise] it didn't i don't think they broke even at all and uh which is i mean i can't imagine feeding two hundred like
[noise]
yes we have several
we do extended families have you do you have you participated in a family reunion
um i i know that when we've had ours they set a date and they have them every um year and it's mostly on my mom's side of the family that does it but um
they send out invitations and it's the very same weekend of every year and it's in july and they always bring um
family history information and they have the saturday is all tie- um involved in people getting together um going over there's all these tables set up and they've got all this family history that you can get
information on different people and their childhood and pictures and put together your own history of your family and your ancestors and that's really fun and then on sunday they um
they have a big dinner and everyone's supposed to bring something and it's more of just a time to just chat and get you know reacquainted with your cousins and
and things like that that's the very big extended one that's over two hundred people that go to that
so
right
right
i know on more of a smaller scale my husband's mother and father have boughten a condominium that's in a ski resort in utah
and um they have it a certain week each year that's set aside for the whole family to come home
in july and um everybody tries to go there and stay it's two or three big condominiums that all hook together and so everybody tries to go up and stay and
um all be together on hi- in his immediate family but there were seven children and by the time you get their spouses and their children all there
right
uh-huh
the money yeah
right
[noise] oh how's your products been [noise]
[laughter] i hear that one have you had any lately go out
oh wow
so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
[laughter]
you're kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
yeah
[vocalized-noise] the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and
i bought this paint stripper where they advertise [noise]
that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product
it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it
but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
that's incredib-
[laughter]
and they all went out at the same time
or two days
wow
[laughter]
wow that's frustrating
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh they go out a lot
yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i -ust home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
yeah
at morton international and
i thin- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything
after each assembly process
and so our testing is pretty thorough but
um
um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't
i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag
and but we do test after during the assembly proj- product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there
after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so
[laughter]
yeah
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
it's incredible how much testing they have to do
uh-huh
[noise]
um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy
goes bad just after the warranty runs out
yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave
all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh
i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
yeah it was a hassle [noise]
yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the i- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself
lasted three years and it was three years and two months
no
uh watch out
um-hum
hm
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh
microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh
the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
uh within two days of each other
i was
it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so
even if uh i think even if i had uh
had kept the warranty the service agreements were
with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that
retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not
but i didn't have to worry about all that because
they weren't under warranty
so
it was a call to the local appliance dealer
who came out and fixed them all but
i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and
the other two weren't but i just
other than that you know tvs and
things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
oh really that's interesting
do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
um-hum
well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to
to come about but that
oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
[noise]
well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named milton friedman
yeah well no no he actually wasn't he he's an uh he was uh
[noise] he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe
uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh
and i'm a m- kind of a milton friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um
[noise]
that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a c._p._a. and i c- i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh
in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they
take money from them
[vocalized-noise] you bet i do yep
[noise] something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i'd i can't believe how
ta- y- you know [vocalized-noise] our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how
tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue
uh-huh
uh-huh
th- that's right
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
right
the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right
but for every man woman and child in the united states they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece
i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
i'd be done i'd be sunk
you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt
i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the soviet union did
or uh i i don't know how how how can we
yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh
yeah because we write off debts we loaned the mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them
that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was turkey we wanted to use their air strips during the persian gulf
so we just went over there and said gee guys uh you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it
that's ridiculous
and uh and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other f- from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise me
[noise]
what do you think about the japanese and the comments they've made recently about the american people i'm not sure that's [vocalized-noise] actually a political issue but uh
[laughter] that's true
and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong
uh-huh
[laughter]
right
[noise]
um [noise] so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual [vocalized-noise] uh lives
um yeah he's a commentator isn't he
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point
i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned
you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you know have this bread and circuses policy of
you know w- we'll give you a dollar a day if you vote for us [vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah i mean your kids won't be happy but [laughter]
[noise] you'll be able to buy that that extra six pack of beer at the end of the week [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years
um
and we we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world
supposedly
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah maybe i would [noise]
we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
i uh um
well it in it um
i think if anyone but the japanese had made it if [vocalized-noise] if an american had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them [laughter]
[noise]
oh yeah yeah yeah [noise]
um
you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy
um in management um
you know our
we you know we we you know [vocalized-noise]
you know the trend of of over consumption since world war two um
you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy [vocalized-noise] thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that you know [vocalized-noise] just moved for better and better standards of living
and where a bunch of other factors i think you know [vocalized-noise] is just
you know [vocalized-noise] it's [vocalized-noise] it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that
you know when when you know when when you combine with the with the mismanagement that a lot of american companies have had
and yeah i think that you know that's [vocalized-noise] when he says that they were la- i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use
but i think you know you know un- [vocalized-noise] unwilling you know un- the american workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are
[noise] okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
uh-huh
um-hum
well um does your company have good benefits in that [noise] in that regard
uh-huh
oh yeah
um-hum
hm
i see
uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an h._m._o. um so
that's in my opinion that's gett- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um
um-hum
right
yes
that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been
when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
and uh at that time i immediately joined the h._m._o. and i never really
so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the h._m._o. and uh you know for me it's worked out real good
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh georgia tech in the research branch and i guess
another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit
right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter] right
well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with
um
and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
right
right
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
okay are there
[noise] are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benef-
[noise]
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh
covering medical costs for yourself or family members
yeah i thin- i work for a a public school system district and uh [noise] so it's different than a company where
most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um
the employee must pick up
a greater figure in the way of uh costs but i- overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration
is because of the cost of insurance
going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
it has not disturbed me any how about yourself
uh-huh
right yeah our district did that
for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the h._m._o. and um
i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um
uh
i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i- i have to say it really works but again
i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join
it can be very stressful for you know those people
uh-huh
yeah
right but if you you know have a family and and um
everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel
knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and
my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as
you know good so [noise]
uh
oh all right
i do too are you talking about like spring break and right
right
it it really um
[noise] i don't think
most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but
i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just
texas has really um
[noise]
you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just
we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there
okay i li-
well that's good yeah i would think that that type of
employment you're you're
one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um
you know it's good that they allow you that
it um a- i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get
many days off and um
we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time
i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just
continued to uh stay there
so
[noise] w- nancy what kind of a personal computer do you have
something like that yeah i have one of those too [laughter]
yeah do you use computers at work or
uh-huh
so do i [laughter]
i see
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah
something like that
oh
do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or
[laughter]
[laughter]
that's right that's right
well mine mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now
[noise]
i found a technician who works at t._i.
and does things like that in his spare time
oh yeah
yeah
but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home
yeah
yeah i've done a lot of that
and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or
have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it
what else do you need right
well that's probably true
[laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah write your own games right
the computer i work have at work came with uh windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just
just standard card solitaire
but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and [laughter]
i ju- i just happened to stumble across that of course i don't play games at work right [laughter]
uh-huh
that's right [laughter]
[laughter] i was going to say you must have a printer then
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh we still have an old uh texas instruments
professional computer
back in the days when t._i. was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the i._b._m. i don't remember what those were the ats or something like that or
[laughter] way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it unfortunately so we just sort of stumble on using
the same stuff that we always have
um well i used to i have a master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
creative writing without having to have uh
uh the mechanics of
handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i'd like a
a more logical
arrangement of the letters and uh
what do they call it the cortiope or something
arrangement
um
we haven't for
we ended up uh
actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isn't that a terrible statement people who are
we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um
i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
but then you have to remember to write it down
or enter it
oh my
where do you find a place to work on a t._i.
uh-huh
well that's nice to know that there are still such people around
yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until
as i say until i took a hi- hiatus from working i used to
to uh
trying to think of what you call it i- i used it essentially as a terminal then
you know
and
so
yeah
well my kids think i should have games
on top of games on top of games [laughter]
and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program [laughter]
write your own games yeah i just
oh
yeah
oh really
[laughter]
uh
no who would do something like that
but uh
yeah we have basically we use the wordstar on it
you know for a bunch of
i'm taking a class now and
um i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the
and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
right [laughter] right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the
connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the
you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to wo-
[noise] well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the mid east what do you what do you think
yeah
it that that happens a lot doesn't it
wars don't usually settle things [laughter] much
um um and i i guess i i feel like we
we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing
uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts
and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such
we wouldn't have done this you know
and would
uh-huh
yes [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
but iran of course used to be our friend
[laughter]
i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it
oh
yeah um
right
on our hi- on our really bad list [laughter]
and i i i keep reading about jordan's king hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is
r- yes yes right
right
of doing that either no [laughter] no i i i i just get a sense of our
walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something
didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or
something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman
you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while
and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but
oh absolutely yes
i mean wh- which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation [laughter]
every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like
um
yes
it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like
golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance
possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting
i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean don't
[laughter] i i s- i i did see one of the peace rallies where they just said [laughter] i can't remember the exact thing it was
something like george and sa- and saddam go home
[noise]
well yeah i uh
and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it
a year a year ago now when the the war desert storm was finishing up seems like things were uh
going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all i've
um-hum
yeah right
right
yeah and and i- i think there's a
yeah i- i- i i have very much doubt that
that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on
in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend
and that that
saddam hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against iran
and uh iran was our bigger enemy and then [laughter] when it turns out that uh saddam hussein
right
right
and
righ- oh yes yes and when we decided saddam hussein was our enemy then the uh uh
oh what's his name in uh syria uh
uh hafaia susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh
you know and
right
right right and and uh
i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being
so definitely tied to to the israeli side in terms of all of that israeli versus arab
and uh
i haven't seen uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that [laughter] yeah yeah so
right
right
right and
yes
yeah well it it
from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding
[laughter] to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh
i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh iraq in particular
was that it seemed to me that george bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that
that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that saddam hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
and and that uh
uh oh boy
oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fa- fascinating watching
yes
yeah
right
right
yes
yes
[noise]
huh
yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget
yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called mastering your money by ron blue
you've you've heard of him it's r- it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um
ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um
the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um
the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so
we may spend a little more there and a little less in a- in another area
so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um
you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do
[noise] well [noise] we um
i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend no you may not
um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know [noise] some people do um [noise] en- en- envelope
systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me
yes we have um [vocalized-noise] we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and
uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of [noise] it in cd's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have
and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to
put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for
i- you know things you know things like that and then um
that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be
i i'm sorry i didn'- i didn't hear you
yeah
um
well he recommends that you don't um or he hel- he recommends that you you get them down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um
every month if we use them um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um
[noise] i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it al- we will always work it out where
where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards
because that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit
so are you married
which will suck up your money real quick
[noise]
um-hum
is all you need
i think just one is all you need
well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before
hm
oh yeah i've heard of that
um-hum
um-hum
have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing
um-hum
um-hum
well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain s- uh you know savings objectives
i mean where do you put that money
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted
i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or
is that part of the system to discontinue that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
right
yes
[vocalized-noise] yes we are i am and uh we've got some children and uh
you know we've just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that we're renting and that's gonna
yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh
you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to dallas in july
and uh you know we'd go out to eat on sunday after church or something like that and i think we're gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids
okay martin do you do any exercise
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
um
so those are more or less indoor sports how's the weather out there in georgia
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to
up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time
it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called the firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with
not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is r- it's really fun
yes uh-huh
uh-huh yes
um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that
oh
that's the big thing huh
oh
so how is that
ooh
[laughter]
oh
uh-huh
yeah
huh
now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees
oh dear
[laughter]
[noise]
uh-huh
um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and
oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy an- so that's what he does he wears his
his brace and his high tops and
oh
uh oh shoot
wow
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter] oh dear [laughter] oh
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches
and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video
um and then the bike on the other day
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds
real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights
for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video
so
it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to
losing this weight and being firm and healthy [laughter]
yes
yes now this one has been quite mild um
we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
it was quite chilly but not
[noise]
yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do
yeah
um [laughter] in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold
um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
um
how about yourself
uh-huh
um-hum
right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
um-hum
huh
yes it's it's it's aerob- it's similar to aerobics with weights
but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights
okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
uh yes i have in in atlanta that's um most of the health clubs
are all that's the that's the in thing
at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
um it they call it a low impact aerobics
and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
and from when i've done it it does give you a good
a real good workout
but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
you know that and movement of going up on the step
you know that could create a problem
they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know [noise]
yeah i i think
my ankles probably are my lame weak point but
i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
and um we- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
yeah
yeah i
um-hum
yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
[laughter] i mean
it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it
because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
[laughter]
but um so how how successful is your exercise video
uh-huh
um
um-hum
um-hum
so it's a good workout
[noise]
um-hum
so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow
[noise] so how do you get most of your current event information
uh-huh
right
um-hum
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
yeah
right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um
talking with people and just hearing what's going on but
just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
so
oh uh-huh yeah
right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a c- candidate can get them to follow then the news will
you know kind of publicize his name
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
right
right and the news too it just doesn't um cover a- that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
right i
i used to read every month a reader's digest
but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on [laughter] not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
but
right
[noise]
[noise] well i um they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on
outside of texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
[laughter] yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics [laughter]
i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah
[laughter]
yeah
right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but
well duri- see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
and i don't watch t._v. as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um
i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
uh-huh
yeah
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the mcneil lehrer hour
oh really
uh-huh oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public t._v. so it's kind of different
i think i think the uh
i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
yeah
yeah exactly
uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say
you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it
yeah [noise]
yeah
what kind of uh see i subscribe to like science news and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
but other than that i don't really r- i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
well i remember dur- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t._v. on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
but uh
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
if they reported every m- if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh
oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o- on the olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh
i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over
i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
yeah it seems like
i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or [vocalized-noise] if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s- some channel for it but i don't have cable
uh do you have any recycling going on in your community
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but
oh really
it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will
recycle magazines
the glossy magazines yes
uh
and then they charge you for the service
uh-huh
was this something that was voted on or uh
hum by the city council or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
they'd charge for it [vocalized-noise]
whether
you take advantage of it or not
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
well we have uh
some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in [vocalized-noise] our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines
uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
and uh cardboard
and it used to be free
for a few weeks then they
sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations
and i
i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now
uh
and i [vocalized-noise]
i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out
so it may work out monetarily
okay for us to be charged for it
uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash
right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people
this is another this is uh
um carl carl's recycling
and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh
private and nonmandatory
and people just put things out on the curb
um he's competing with some uh
very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables
so it's uh
um-hum
yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh
they have all this used newsprint that people don't want
right
uh yes we do we've started out with uh um
all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up uh lots of
different kinds of waste
and they uh
uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times
uh
and uh so
now you have all kinds of of uh things that they didn't use to pick up like magazines and uh
various forms of of uh
glass tin and things like that
uh
well no [vocalized-noise] in a a long time ago you didn't uh they didn't pick up any of that and and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately they've gone in to it in a big way and they've said the uh they have to pick up
i think it's
uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up
yes
yes well now these so they're
we're being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people
uh
the city council did it they decided that that there was
portland is kind of a
ecology minded area and so they uh
uh although there're some complaints because the
there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the
the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh
uh
they charge
much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing
in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now
because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now
so they can you know it's the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can
they don't have to work very hard at at keeping costs down
so how about your area
of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up
oh i see what you're saying
the thing that that uh has another thing that's been in the press here has been
that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the uh
how should i say it the market can't absorb
all of the uh
right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market it's piling up uh
i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from
[noise] how do you feel about capital punishment
yeah
[noise] for what reasons
um-hum
[noise] yeah definitely yeah i- i [noise] i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the econ- for economic reasons because i- i don't think it acts as a deterrent
[noise] and i don't think that um [noise] and and and for what i've what i've read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed them for the en- end you know
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum [noise]
is he prose-
oh he's he's a he's for the defendant okay [noise]
uh-huh [noise]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it's uh i mean i've you know i've seen people that you know definitely got screwed by the system
before yeah um is do they have the death penalty in new york
[noise] yeah they do um [noise] yeah i'm not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone i don't really keep you know i don't really keep up after when the last one was
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
constitutional
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
in tennessee
you know one thing that i've always that i've one idea that i've heard that that that i've you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone that's
you know that that that that you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty
it ju- seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah he he told us his yeah he said that he wanted to die at that point [vocalized-noise]
um-hum [noise] it
you know it really bothers me that in historical cases you know where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know and when they're you know on death row and and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them [laughter]
and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of
um-hum
oh like in texas
[noise]
um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it
uh i think that they make a lo- the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um
you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late
yeah it dose because because of uh [noise] the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should
but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the supreme court
um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the supreme court when they used to be
so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh
down in tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row
[noise] yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um [noise] let's say um
cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convic- certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway
i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't
yeah so
no huh um they do in georgia right yeah they
right well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that
just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the
the bottom line was that uh [noise] what was i saying uh nobody in tennessee has been con- has been executed since nineteen
uh sev- uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and un-
yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials
um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not
um then then that's okay they can it it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have
um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and
yeah in tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them yeah
yeah
yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy gary gilmore did right
you know the guy
right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um
yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in dea- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want
[vocalized-noise] which is basically what that is but
yeah sure
i did some i did some en- environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the f. d. a. they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug
it was a drug that was that they were using for the death penalty and they tr- to right they tried to get it proved safe before the f. d. a. would approve it [laughter]
[noise]
i think that uh one uh advantage
of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um
and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
is very unreasonable in some way that uh
you uh would have a problem
uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
have you ever served on a jury before
oh
uh what sorts of cases were they
so were they criminal or civil
oh okay
what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
yeah
so did it become
yeah
ah
oh
but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
what was what was the other case that was also civil
yeah
oh didn't really even count
yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um
and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i
declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i- i haven't
um one one thing that i- i think is um
you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
uh especially sort of
ow well
[noise] the
ah but you thought it turned out pretty well
yeah
oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or
so it worked it did end up working out pretty well
the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh
whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of
uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um
if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so
yeah
ah
oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments
yeah
ah so they were suing to get it back
ah
yeah
uh
[noise]
definitely
um-hum
uh i have twice
it was pretty wild experience
they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal
uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people
so it was they and uh the one changed his vote
at the end
so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so
right
the the uh other case was just traffic
the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly
go through so
yeah
yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
it [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise] i wouldn't think that it does
i mean from from my e- from what i experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't
didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it
yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and
it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so
i'm not used to it not being organized and i just a- assumed that it would have been
that's
that's about what it was [noise]
yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it
turn out the way it should have so
yeah it ended up working all right
yes
uh i don't think that they they they educate them enough to
to really know what's going on
yeah [vocalized-noise] the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer
that which was assumingly their property it was on his property
right
so they came to get it
and then when they came to get it well i- it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off
so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
so they left it there
and then when
they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
so they were suing him for the money and
you know there's no way they could because it's
it was the moving company [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
uh greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in indiana don't you have the the death penalty
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum uh i- i tend to agree with you uh [noise] i've changed my views over uh e- even within the last few years uh to be honest [noise] uh
[noise]
uh when i was in coll- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh ho- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
but [noise] the uh
the more now i live in [vocalized-noise] downtown dallas and i uh [laughter] you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
[noise]
i think that [noise] maybe a
a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder
yeah uh i-
yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i- uh i- i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
uh
[noise]
i also [noise] uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh
big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example th- these people need to be uh eliminated uh
from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh
uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh
create another power structure [laughter]
you know the
uh-huh
right
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
uh
[noise]
do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital [vocalized-noise] capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced
um-hum
right
that's true yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
sure yeah i understand i understand your point
yeah uh of course you know with uh with with dahlmer now uh y- you realize that ohi- i think it's ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty
yeah
[noise]
[noise] so uh that was a curious case i
uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
uh well here in texas we uh i think even even this last week
uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
[noise]
yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often [noise] but we do have it
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten la- years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
uh-huh
right
right
right
that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that wh- which seems pretty sensible
right
right yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you're you're right there uh
i ju- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
y- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
and in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing god [laughter] which is n- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld
uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like noriega and such as that i think that they're
they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think tha- that it's
it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
um-hum
yeah
y- yeah that is very curious
yeah
that's that's right
[noise] okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now
uh
i served i was in the air force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one
uh-huh
was it civil or criminal
a grand jury or some-
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that
uh-huh
um
no
that
that's a science in itself
uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh [laughter]
so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
huh
um
wow i bet that made him happy
right
uh-huh
yeah
oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury
uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh wayne kennedy smith trial uh
a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s- a simple majority you know rules
yeah
a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we [vocalized-noise] the two that i were on had to do with drugs
and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things
the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases
uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
all they could do was testify about
[noise]
yeah
so have you ever served on a jury
[noise] yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet
and i finally was [noise] so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring
uh it was uh
[noise] uh it was uh
well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks
so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then
it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room
uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh
i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me
course they don't have to give a reason but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions
yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh
questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh
they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more
[laughter]
yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know
[laughter]
well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh
decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating
allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that uh we weren't were una- unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again
yeah
yeah it was uh it was funny
the uh i ju- i- i don't know i uh
i didn't uh
uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate and uh i uh i- i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed
so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure
uh it must have been six
yeah
um
um
yeah
well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and
uh-huh
uh t- it was too circumstantial
um
[noise] course i don't like talking about budgets [laughter] no not my favorite subject
um-hum
uh-huh so you pretty much keep pretty close to your budget
yeah
[noise] boy
[laughter] well we bought a house about a year and a half ago but i- i can't say that i'm as uh
good a- as you are about our budget because i mean i'm in charge of paying the bills but uh you know i put a little bit in the savings first and then after that i'll you know pay on everything as i can and [noise]
and that's i- i don't have a budget other than that i know i need to and i know we probably will in the future but as of yet we're just still trying to you know get on on where we wanna be financially and then
maybe we can um you know work more on [noise]
you know they have all these financial plans and how much money you have saved and where you wanna put it and everything well we're sti- we're still trying to save a little bit
yeah well yeah exactly
yeah
exactly and see we've got two used cars and you know when you have used cars there's always something you're fixing on them
you may not have a car payment but you know you have those regular maintenance things i mean li-
yeah yeah but i'm gonna be out of a job in september
yeah
oh i work for a liquor uh distiller [noise]
yeah and they're moving their offices u- offices up to connecticut
so i'll be staying down here [noise] but i'm not real worried about it so but it's something else that you know we have to be considering in our budget
and trying to take care of everything you know all the um outstanding debt that we have and kind of getting ready for it
[noise] it it's the worst thing because when i got out of college you know that was our mistake when we got married you know we didn't have much so we kind of charged it up and now we're you know paying for it
um-hum
but she's not working now
do y'all have a family
oh well we don't have a family either besides a couple dogs and a cat [laughter]
yeah well i wanna try to um
[noise] go back to school get a degree that that you know i something i'll enjoy doing a little bit more
so you know um
[noise] i'll
i'm sorry my husband he works in banking he's in finances and economics
he's kind of like a loan servicer accountant right now but he's trying to trying to switch over into international trade because you know with the free trade agreements going on here there's really gonna be a lot of opportunity
[noise] so we hope anyways [laughter] and what do you do
oh automotive safety bags is that like air bags
-nother term [noise] well i guess [noise] i covered all the budgeting that i wanted to [laughter]
no you don't you you can stop at anytime you're you're finished [noise] i mean i've never i've been doing this for a while now and i've they've never not paid me so
yeah it was nice talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh you don't
this is my first one we just bought a house about three months ago and so we had to go on one [noise] and um what i do is um just
divide up my paycheck and put it in each category i put it in my day planner
and i have a certain amount on each column like under groceries or electricity
and i put so much in each one and then just subtract of
just spend what [noise] the amount in each column what we're allotted
yeah [laughter] if not [laughter] we're up a creek [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's tough we have an emergency fund that we keep and that was tough to get we try to not touch that we've [vocalized-noise] gone to the house but sometimes you dip into it
oh yeah [laughter]
uh-huh do both of you work your husband
oh you are
where do you work at
liquor distiller
oh wow
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's a thing we try to stay out of is debt um
it it's hard though when you first get married you want things to live on because i just got married what two and a half years ago
and we tried not to do that my wife worked at the time so we bought most [noise] no
um no it's just me and her right now
we have one dog [laughter] but it's good we- she- looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car
oh
uh-huh
what's your husband do
uh-huh
that's true
[laughter]
um i work for morton international and make um i'm a process engineer that we make automotive safety bags
the air bags yeah same thing
[laughter] i don't do you have to go up until do you have to go until the voice comes on but i'm not sure [noise] do that
oh okay
oh good all right well thanks for talking wendy
you too bye
[vocalized-noise] hello
yeah uh
we we- me and my wife we got a five year old and we have
uh
kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that it's it's pretty he's a pretty good kid
and we uh really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base
they charge about forty five dollars a week
um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside
oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff
oh about a year now
well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so
no the wife went back to school
so he's been there for almost a year now
she goes to u._t. uh arlington
yeah uh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um yeah
[laughter]
yeah we- well when i was stationed in lubbock texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean
and that helped out my wife because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but
and uh i think it's a good dea- deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's
it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself
well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in
in [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah um um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had
so you know it it worked out pretty good
uh
well i haven't really thought about it like that
[laughter]
because well you know we pay [noise]
excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know
to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it
[noise] uh hello steve
uh you were going to talk about child care
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i see how much how much do they charge
uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week
right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service
uh-huh
uh how long have you been taking your son there
uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or
i see
you say you went back to school
oh i see uh-huh
uh-huh
um gee i think [laughter] [noise] where where does she go to school
uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time
but i think we're getting off the topic so
so um [noise] let's see i mean i- i was uh rea- i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done
and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers
and uh that was i- i thought it was import- well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose
because a lot of kids are in you know in centers we- well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh
uh that's the sort of the- the- they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them very far
plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could
fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble
um so uh anyway [laughter] i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh
still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really would- wouldn't um uh well i'm on
gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right uh-huh
yeah it's just a lot of time
yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
um-hum
s- s- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which s- seems most appealing to you
yeah
i think
well th-
that's right yeah
well i mean the- they yeah the i- the issue is whether they can uh take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other pro-
i haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet
um-hum
that's for sure yeah
um-hum um-hum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too [laughter]
yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were s- not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was
what do you do with the other person it's particularly hard if they live away
um-hum
yeah
well that's a problem and i [vocalized-noise] uh my grandmother was ninety
two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point
it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like that's where sh- she wanted to die was where she was not to
staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think it's harder if they if they're younger but need a lot of care
you know at ninety that's one thing at at sixty or seventy it's something else and yet
right right
right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's
you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be cl- you know
clean and that that it's got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference
yes that that's the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls
oh
alzheimer yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well i that's the thing i mean when it's something like that i- i think it particularly if it's something like that and they really don't know where they are
it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d-
exactly
and i you know i do- i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother
moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and that's where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years
and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said
w- she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and there're people there
which in her home you know there weren't i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said i've i've really made some friends and that feels good so that's the other side of it is
um-hum um-hum
yeah but but it's just that
you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly
uh-huh
exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and that's another hard thing
uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh
fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not [laughter]
uh-huh
so they'll tell you well she says she doesn't like the food but you should see her plate you know or some
so then y- i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's
[noise]
no i haven't either but a lot of my friends and actually my boss had to put his mother in a nursing home and i know just going through it with him i mean it's a real traumatic experience
first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know
oh really
um-hum
okay that's what i was just going to say if they're out of state you know it's different if they're in the same town i think you have a little more chance to look out for them but
then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there
um-hum
uh-huh
oh oh you mean not staying at home -ou mean and not yeah yeah
um-hum
no yeah well that's just it because i mean jeez they've got p- probably good twenty years to live you know so- some cases if they're healthy you know
it would be clean yeah
i know and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know
um-hum
yeah
in fact i used to date a guy that reminds me when i was back in minneapolis but his mother i mean he had she ended up i guess getting it al- what they now call alzheimer's yeah
but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and we'd go to visit her but then
it would get you know like she didn't really know she didn't know me and then she thought he was a brother you know and it just got steadily worse you know
um-hum
and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know
um
um-hum
um
just getting used to it
oh
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because they'd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess
well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when they're expecting you to come
you know just to see how you know at different times of the day what they do and how they treat them you know
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
or is it just because yeah they're having such a hard time adjusting you know
um-hum
[noise]
oh you are
you're you're into uh recycling
um-hum what materials do you recycle
um-hum
um-hum
so
so you're trying to take action to have that changed
um-hum
right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention [laughter]
right
um-hum
well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was
forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound
so it uh [noise] there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment
um-hum
right
hm yeah where [noise] where i work we recycle paper that's about it
yeah any any um non- noncolored or nonfilm type paper just white paper and that sort of thing
and
uh
oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated
for personal printers and then like laserjet type paper
we don't use the green bar type paper any more
right [laughter]
um-hum
well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling
i mean
unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] right well there are neighborhoods in the atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis
right
right
[laughter]
[noise]
right
[noise] topic is recycling today
and actually i'm pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am
i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact
i recycle glass plastic and aluminum
also paper and plastic bags
and i uh in dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening
about what's being done with the recycled the recycling materials
and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills
and i got really hot about that because my h- my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and it's packed in green glass
well yeah i'm i'm racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in atlanta
and they're paying i think
eighteen cents
for every hundred pounds of green glass
no i'm not but i've got
good gosh i've got probably
twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now
waiting for a recycling place to take it to and
i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to
was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that
yeah
um-hum
no
well that's the that's the thing is [noise] i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center
and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world
in regards to education and i think that's a real worthwhile project and
that's really what got me started recycling was this uh community center
so
do you which kind of pap- computer paper
oh any
uh-huh
oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper
i mean like the the green and white barred
oh you don't use that paper okay
oh yeah [noise] uh-huh
[noise] the old the old green bars um-hum
yeah because our our church also recycles computer paper and
i don't know why i was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to
even the personal
[noise] uh letter sized
uh well
yeah we have volunteers and there's not that it's
not that wide of a par- participation just yet
so although with my friends helping we we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and
quite a few of the children are in baby food
and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast
so
oh yeah curbside recycling
yeah they have that in houston and in dallas
and i saw another report where in houston they take the bins
and they load them up into the truck in the separate areas in the truck
and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill
[noise] that got me heated up too
that got me real heated up a friend of my mother's told her about that and she was telling me about it and then i saw a report on t._v. too
and i thought why are we going through this trouble
and i had a report tell me why we are we go through the trouble because everybody's worried about the environment
and now that we have uh the the smaller the lay people worried about the environment
now we have to get the businesses worried about using the recycled product
that not that many businesses are
[noise] well what kind of music do you like to listen to
are you
oh you like country western
yeah
um yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too um
i went to a pretty uh
well the school i went to was texas a&m an and uh [noise] either you either you went country western dancing or uh
yeah [laughter] pretty mu- pretty much so so i ha- i really liked i liked it there but i als- also like some of the christian um contemporary music that they have play
yeah
yeah yeah it's popular here and [noise] uh there's all
yeah
um-hum
yeah
oh really
that's fun
well what you you mentioned alternative music
what is that [laughter]
oh okay [laughter]
um-hum
you said you're also a performer
what do you perform
do you [noise]
oh wow
yeah
[noise] um not on a consistent basis at this point [noise] i've got three kids and they're preschoolers so i do good to [noise] get a b- book read or newspaper read or anything so [noise]
yeah yeah
in fact i do good to [noise] listen to anything but kids' tapes at this point because i know all the kids' tapes it's like yeah [noise]
they do have they do have some good tapes out there for kids we [noise] i don't know um
joe scruggs is a guy that is out of austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes it's r- i mean they are really fun and uh joe scruggs he's with he's an educational
um it's called shadow play and if you ever see any of his stuff he is just he's really good and [noise] and um kids really like it
yeah
uh-huh
oh
[laughter] i don't know i don't know [noise] well um [noise] have you [noise] um [noise] they're not they're more uh oh have you ever heard of riders in the sky i don't know if they're
if they're big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on saturday mornings for kids
um
they're pretty neat they're kind of a a a blue grass country uh they're real fun i mean they're
they're the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and they're real fun they're a real fun group
yeah
yeah well yeah
[noise]
well we saw them originally at a at a club down here um probably about oh seven or eight years ago and um
then just in the last i don't know two years we saw them on a t._v. show [noise] and i think they were i think they were doing kids' music but
what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i don't know i don't know where they run the gamut and i don't know um
you know i don't know if the south is more towards the you know has more of that crowd or not i don't know i don't know do y- [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
w-
[noise]
i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh
alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that
country's not bad i c- i grew up in nebraska so it was like um yeah i- i listen to it once in a while but it's it's probably not my my top mode i guess that's pretty pretty popular down in plano though uh
oh yeah
so you didn't do anything at all right [laughter]
huh
uh-huh
are you into the garth brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that he's kind of a big name right now
yeah
and you're also into the christian contemporary stuff
yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um
groups like uh i'm trying to remember d._m._z.
resurrection band uh what else
there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into petra as well
in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i- i'm going to school in florida
and he's an engineer that does sound mi- mixing right now for a christian bands
so yeah he's pretty into it
it's been it's been lucratim for him
well yeah um kind of like
i don't know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock [laughter]
but then now it's it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's it's gone more diverse toward
um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs
really a wider more eclectic uh
tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um
yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so
it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all
yeah
oh wow
sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh
i know that feeling
yeah
[laughter]
yeah well may- hey that may be more quality you know after all
yeah
joe scruggs huh
interesting uh
when you said scruggs i was thinking because earl scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player
and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the beverly hillbillies
he actually played part of that
uh he and lester flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative [laughter]
but
[vocalized-noise] any-
oh
yeah i haven't heard much about that no
yeah
all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit
i'm uh i'm not quite at that point in my life yet so
it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the appalachian mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i- i've had some friends from west virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there
an-
[noise]
i guess my basic feeling is that
as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but
uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and
i don't know [laughter] i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all
[laughter]
yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been
discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation
seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the
sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the
entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity [vocalized-noise]
yeah although
my
oh excuse me
yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not
but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs
for instance or public improvements and today there
there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for
tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly
yeah
yeah
[noise]
do you think that that's because the uh
because the politicians have been seduced by the the opportunity to get the vote
uh so they've spent the money on
on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh
[noise] uh let's see how shall i say it
paying money to people that that uh
[noise]
uh
it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh
[noise]
uh input of money can uh
which they can never turn off by the way uh will get this guy votes
there was
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
i was just going to say there's significantly more money uh
and we weren't a debtor nation in those days
well [vocalized-noise]
i think two things have happened number one
uh
it's like uh
[noise]
pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where
[noise] where the pay later is uh is here and [noise] and uh
when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and
and it just goes by pretty fast well uh the play now pay later uh
mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh
um
the the debt load is way up uh
you know in the sixties
what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was
was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right
i don-
[vocalized-noise] yeah i mean well i'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh
you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where
where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh
uh
progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made
you know the daily the minimum wage is [noise] let's see what is it when i was a [noise] i'm
i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i [vocalized-noise] hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year
and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh
you know taxes on wha- what i thought was a very good salary
um
are about the same as they are today only i'm making
[noise] so um [noise] what do they do about recycling in raleigh is there any public program
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah
um-hum oh that
well in atlanta they um where i used to live they had a they had just started a program but apparently it wasn't city wide because i moved over to a different neighborhood and they didn't e- you know no one had ever heard of this [noise]
and um [noise] the one nice thing though is i'm is i'm luck- is i'm pretty close to downtown so um [noise] aluminum cans can be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and
um no they don't have any deposit but um you know there's a there's a thriving industry of homeless people that [laughter] collect uh aluminum cans and turn them in for you know recy- the the weight in aluminum
[noise] uh-huh
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
um-hum yeah i'm not sure i- i don't i think they only carry one bag when i when i've seen people out there you know
yeah
hm
um-hum
yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and pick out the different things
um-hum
yeah i- i mean it's you know they have the cost of the cleaning equipment to clean the bottles and
and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i've heard that you know a lot a lot of the you know more popular recycled materials like aluminum and um [noise] paper especially that because you know everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that
[noise] their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries
you can't just you know take a bunch of stuff and recycle it you generally you mix it with with new material
and that and that you know wi- you know coupled with the recession that there just isn't you know the demand for you know recycled product
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um
um-hum yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle
that they have on them but because they i have a lot of friends that you know are very into recycling you know and say you know just about you know they they try and throw out as little as they can you know and and
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum [noise]
[noise]
yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city
and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that they're recycling um
and so you know there [laughter] really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um
and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics
how about how about in your area
[vocalized-noise]
right
um-hum
[laughter] do they have a deposit on them
right right yeah because uh in in places where there's a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up [laughter] which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh
course uh now with adopt-a-highway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but i'm not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh
yeah well i mean well y- yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah
yeah that would that would be good because uh you know
um-hum right o- of course if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do
um now soft drink companies don't want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i don't know
um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i- i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like
it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the wall street journal about three or four weeks ago
it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they [laughter] they they [vocalized-noise] critics start recycling before there's an industry to deal with the stuff and
i forget where it was i think it was portland oregon ended up burning a bunch of it [laughter] it was just piling up and they had no where to put it
hm
um-hum
right yeah i think th-
[noise] yeah well i don't yeah i don't know i guess if [vocalized-noise] as far as packaging materials are c- are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i
i don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i- i- i- i- i expect it
well i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money [noise] um
but um yeah i- th- th- the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products you're talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one
there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things
and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah that's right r- right um well i'm down i read somebody say he was down to uh one bag of garbage a week and that's about the same with me but i'll tell you my garbage is mostly by weight is mostly junk mail
[laughter] if i could get rid of that [laughter] it wouldn't be much at all it's just that
[noise]
so have you had to think about uh
nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life
uh-huh
oh that's very young
uh-huh
uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh
seventy and my mother must be about sixty five
so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand
no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um
but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing
[noise]
yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something
you know special you can't handle it anyway uh
i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us
but there are certain health
you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard
that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars
yeah
yeah what the heck
yeah
yeah its
it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and
uh
yeah
yeah
i saw something on six- sixty minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in texas that was a real you know horror piece
yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could
put away enough money to handle it ourselves
huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left
well that's could be worse i think
if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably
yeah i- i think that might be s- might be sufficient
um-hum
[noise]
yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh
to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it
well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not
you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point
yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh
the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh
everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
yeah my wife has c- certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are [laughter] it comes time to deal with it
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age
yeah um
so that really hasn't been an issue for me
how about yourself
um-hum
um-hum
right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or
um-hum
yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home
so it tends to be kind of useless anyway
um-hum
right
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah
i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to
to have a nurse come into the home periodically
yeah
dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time
yeah
and certainly more dignified than uh
than warehousing them
right
yeah
it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight
and uh you know they just really can't take care of them very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run
um-hum
yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good
yeah
yeah
yeah it seems that way
yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead
yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go
i'd be happy
yeah th- that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh
heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for
right
yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree
yeah
yeah
well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life
and uh
yeah
yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life
so
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
yeah
seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and
if that's the case then
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh journal of the a._m._a. and american medical news thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something
that they're kind of in a
[noise] -kay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh
m- my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it
uh-huh
uh
yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm
um
i- i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but
more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there
yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of new hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time
we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years
i think one interesting question would be uh
uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that
if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this
or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves th- the death penalty
now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty
i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody
that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them
uh-huh
that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh
is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed
but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives
and in effect causing some of them to die
oh is that right
uh-huh
yeah an- an-
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] that l._s._d. even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something
and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that
well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think
okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later bye-bye
[noise]
oh i believe there i- you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know
uh
i feel like you know they need to
instead of giving the people o- on uh
you know like death row and stuff just leaving them there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it
yeah
yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah that's what i think that they need to do something to change that because
i don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know
it sure does [vocalized-noise]
well that not they're partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh
dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get c- the capital punishment
yeah
oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just [laughter] take them out and shoot them and just you know but uh
that's my opinion on some of the cases
because i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
and you know it's
especially i just saw something on t._v. tonight on the news about l._s._d. in a school over in dallas so
yep so it's
effecting it's way down there in the high schools and stuff and
i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty
yeah
[noise]
uh yeah [laughter]
okay you too
all right bye
[vocalized-noise]
drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing
oh really wh-
uh-huh
oh they do with alcohol
they do it with alcohol
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
huh that's interesting what type of field of work are you in
oh in the oil business okay and you work in the office around
uh-huh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars and we work a- around a lot of explosives
yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know wor- they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole
well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous
yeah
now do they fire them or do they
um-hum
uh-huh
oh wow
huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure becau-
anyway i don't have the
that's right
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
uh-huh
uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
you could time it just right
i've met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous
huh
that's true
um-hum do they give any limits on alcohol or is it
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
[noise] pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh
yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think it's mostly for the
the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's
pardon
yeah yeah they they they they'll check for alcohol
now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
yeah it's a
i'm in the oil business yeah
yeah i work in the office so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on [laughter]
yeah yeah well i- i- i agree i think that uh
you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh
uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff
you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh
you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
well see is [vocalized-noise] this is where i start having my problems with my company i work for a private company and and the the policy is something like
[noise] see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos
yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
[laughter]
yeah
yeah our yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to
you know [noise] go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
well it's [noise] it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not
i guess i ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem
uh
so i gue- you know i guess it works uh
much like uh
well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the a's and b's are going to be in and next week c's and d's are going to come in [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah right right
yeah [vocalized-noise] especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but
not to excess in any case [laughter]
uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do
[noise] um
well i- they must i mean gee whiz
that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because i- i really don't know i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
[laughter]
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company
to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
yeah s-
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or [vocalized-noise]
yeah i have once too so
yeah
[vocalized-noise] yeah i had it during a job interview and
i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them
to do this and i'm just like well uh i'm not even going to think much about it
if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before
you've gotten to know me
[vocalized-noise] uh-huh
yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing
i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or
yeah
hum
[noise]
i tend to to view it
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend
an employer's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
uh and [vocalized-noise] i don't really
[noise]
well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh
very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
um i don't really [noise] think that it's uh
too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh
thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
well i think i think wh- y- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
uh
like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane
but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
uh yeah i have been
i
uh i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean it's [vocalized-noise] it's very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh
[laughter] i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
right
yeah
right
right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just
[noise] you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know
been hired by a corporation
which uh you know i really the other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that
i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work
i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
right
right
that's exactly right
and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that
that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that
it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome [laughter] i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me
right
right
[noise] oops hello i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry [laughter]
okay and i'm melanie from harrisville utah
yeah [laughter] um okay bill we're talking about family reunions
okay um have you ever had to plan a family reunion
oh
uh-huh
and how did you feel it went
oh
all of this planning and and getting together and such
um
oh let's see what else
uh-huh
oh boy [laughter]
uh-huh
oh my word [laughter] oh well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together
uh-huh [noise]
oh uh-huh
oh
oh that's good
uh-huh
and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just potluck uh-huh
yeah yeah show off a little bit [laughter]
oh
oh now how old is she
oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty
oh wow
uh-huh
oh [laughter] oh well that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age
yeah
oh really [laughter] well that sounds fun well i
[noise] i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and there were we sent out five hundred uh announcements
because our family is quite large like your your family there and
so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and
i wasn't sure i appreciated that duty for two years in a row [laughter] but i found that advance planning was the key to success
uh-huh
oh well that was wonderful though [laughter]
[laughter]
oh
oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness
well australia i have a brother lives in australia to uh boise idaho and
and uh all kinds of places
we are [laughter]
oh
in
oh
uh-huh
boy
oh my gosh
[laughter] they must really like it there [laughter]
yeah [laughter] oh
oh [laughter] you're ready to move on to bi-
[noise] -llo
that's okay i'm bill from raleigh
oh so another one from
a different state besides texas [laughter]
right
uh
yes and no it wasn't really a fa- a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i- i kind of know how to do these things i used to you know
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
and they show up and all their kids and then a- she has uh i have
like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone
you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh
for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh
each one of the everybody that showed up do- donated some money for the rent and for
for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill [vocalized-noise] each person in the family you know brought a dish or some [noise]
it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
yeah
and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
uh she's eighty six
now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact [laughter]
oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
[laughter]
uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county [laughter] so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
i would say you're spread out then [laughter]
uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the army and we w-
we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in anson county [laughter]
i live in raleigh and then my my parents live in greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of fayetteville so i mean we're we're
we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town waynesboro so
nobody moves away except us [laughter] yeah i got out as soon as i graduated [laughter]
just like this town is too small for me good-bye [laughter]
[noise] okay you wanna start
uh-huh
yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago
uh-huh so have they stopped that practice now
[noise]
yeah yeah
[noise]
[noise]
oh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
um yeah
yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark
smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
yeah
oh i see
um-hum
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
uh [vocalized-noise] uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons
and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know che- inexpensive and lots of it
uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
so
well [vocalized-noise] course there's only a a [laughter] tremendous number of a refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers
both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems
but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
and that's got me very con- you know highly concerned that uh
[noise]
it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh
have us uh as a an un- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
because as i say there is a there's a tremen- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree
and i mean
so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh
uh and that's a pollu- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and
the those two mixed together with with water and uh [noise] really make a uh make a mess
um-hum
right
well most
most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
uh because when you when d- diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
because diesel oil is uh
is not very volatile
you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
and so if i- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
[noise] so um do you have children of your own
uh how old are they
ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself
uh
uh-huh
uh that certainly is the most straightforward
yeah
i do i have uh one son who will be three in may and uh we're expecting another in may
no not yet al- my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool
a couple of hours a day for the older one next year
uh
just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby
uh but otherwise i- i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh
major disadvantages
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] yes that's true that's true uh
and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age [laughter]
yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh h- how old are your kids when they started some sort of school
um-hum
um
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool
maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because they would take turns
um
uh-huh
oh so that's quite a spread twenty four to five
wow that's great
um
so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home
uh-huh
what kind of what's their relationship like
uh-huh
it would be
very intere- i mean old enough i mean really
[vocalized-noise] no sibling rivalry there i would expect [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle
uh
hold it no that child is
wait a minute this should be very simple
that child is your son's nephew
that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat
yeah
uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle [laughter] whose about forty years older
um
um
do you plan to have more children
[laughter] all said
um
oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby
oh well
well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care
uh-huh
oh it sounds great
uh-huh
yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid
[laughter]
um
but it is nice to i mean i- i find it
it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home
with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting
[noise]
yes
they range in age from twenty four down to five
n- not really my wife has provided the child care up to now
that's the easiest one
do you have children
and have you been into child care
uh-huh
right
well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes
uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lo- i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids
me too [laughter] the last thing they need at that age is academics [laughter]
well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in texas
and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure
with the others we've either
with some friends done a
a sort of mother's day out kind of thing where they took turns
a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief
yeah
we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know i'm ready for a break [laughter]
oh we have eight children so
there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them
uh she was in college actually when the baby was born
very good
oh
no and she kind of really wanted him [laughter] i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it
and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is
my son is a
yeah right
well we didn't quite make that but came close so it doesn't
yeah
yeah
no [laughter]
now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better
they live about uh
four hours from here they're in san antonio
yeah
uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still
and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening
so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it
a- me too [laughter]
i don't know what you hear in california but you know there's a lot of [vocalized-noise]
[noise] do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly
[laughter] do you uh how often
well that's good
that's good
do you walk very far
yeah well that's
that's not bad i mean
i know um just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um
i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master
so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week
well
um uh i- i am uh
uh i did- i have a six month old baby he's my third one and didn't do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so i've been doing it at least for the last
uh last five six months
so but before that i did
uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too
so
i [vocalized-noise]
it's tough
it is
um-hum
[laughter] yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowi- rowing machine because i did that for a while and
i- i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me
and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but
i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe
maybe for my arms
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise
yeah
yeah
ah
yeah well i- i run after preschoolers [laughter] at this point so
[laughter] yeah
well uh yes and no i mean i don't
i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel like you know i've i've
really worked out but i- i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so
but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it an- i an- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um
right now i'm
you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um
so that's
you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so
yeah um i- i'm a member of president's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've
you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um
biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and so it's
[laughter]
i walk
uh about every other day
no
that's not very much really
uh a couple miles
ha- have you done that a long time
that sounds pretty good you're
you're better than i am i uh
[laughter]
i- i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh [noise]
uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh
exercycles but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and
uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move
no i didn't like that
i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the
the main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable
and uh
walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i- i bicycle once in a while
but if it's any kind of equipment then uh
i have uh four kids at home and and
they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings
and it takes me a while to get back into it so
well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is
is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh
uh a couple of people in my group who we just
take off and walk uh
uh over to the shopping center and
walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip
so it's but it's a kind of sedentary job here
i don't know about you but uh
uh
this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs
is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than
than uh
that's a fair amount of exercise by itself right
are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it
[noise]
okay well hello frances
um [noise] yeah i guess when i uh
first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh
subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh
[noise]
screening uh
uh screening for potential problems [noise]
good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh
well i read an article in the wall street journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the
the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis
yeah
uh-huh
[noise] yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with
employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it
one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh
[noise] there's they most of them don't test for
actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse
and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh
i- i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country
so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are of you know are the ones that they focus on
[noise]
well see now in texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago
oh really
oh man
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
right yeah
yeah i expect possibly in texas it's uh
you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy you know [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the highway
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
um-hum
well same here
[laughter]
yeah yeah
[noise]
hello paul [noise]
yeah [noise]
[noise]
yes uh-huh
well the reliability seems to
[laughter]
not be too great um
i don't know
[noise]
i'm kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think i'm for it [laughter] uh [laughter] i really do um
because we lose so much
time and what have you with the the drug problem
and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh
i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh
have some kind of guidelines to go by
but like anything else this can be misused
uh-huh
[noise] right
[noise]
[noise] well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is
more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more
harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh
yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again
this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two dwi's
and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone
and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh
the good old [noise]
yeah good old boy stuff [laughter] you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect [laughter]
[laughter] yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may become that with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's they use cocaine
and it's acc- it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not
they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before and i'm afraid that's what we may be
facing in the very near future
other than that i don't know because i don't drink and i don't do drugs [laughter] and it's uh so neither is really acceptable to me [laughter]
but uh then the work place it's just [laughter] i don't know what is well we really infringing on others' rights or their
[noise]
okay bill right
okay bill have you done much camping
ah ha
oh well that that sounds good
yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in texas do you where do you find places to camp
[noise]
oh
uh-huh
[noise]
oh
oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
[laughter] well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i
um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go
on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're in- involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
[noise]
and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and
so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them
so
um yes they've well
no actually they've i remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
and i don't think they've taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents
and this year i believe it will be in tents also
[noise] so
uh-huh yeah
[laughter]
oh is that right
oh and what does that consist of
[vocalized-noise]
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
yes uh see when when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and [laughter] lots of tents and
i like to sleep on the air mattresses i d- am not [laughter] my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses
um
so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
oh
my word
jeez
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh
oh
oh uh they're covered with like a heavy armor
type stuff uh-huh
my word
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my word
[laughter]
well [vocalized-noise] that sounds a little less fierce than bears we
we want to go
[noise]
yes
uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in boy scouts
i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year [laughter]
i'd say i camp quite a bit
[vocalized-noise]
well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the uh sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
[laughter]
how about yourself
-ell that's good
um-hum
great
what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves
um-hum
uh-huh o- course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah
it doesn't get very cold in texas
so lots of times we don't even take tents
we just use trail tarps
uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of
uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and
they'll keep you dry or whatever
um-hum
ye- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere
uh [laughter] so uh but it [vocalized-noise] even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with boy scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting
but we got to see a lot of deer
um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is
um-hum
and possums and uh raccoons
and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh
they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack
and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
they will if you attack them
but most time they run away from you
if y- if they s- if they see you're up you know
[noise] but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep
so
[noise]
[noise]
okay should begin
uh
i can begin this um basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis
and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical
uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself
um what's your situation
oh
um-hum
are you a professor there
oh i see okay
oh no doubt [laughter]
right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is uh
i used to work with the army research institute and being a uh
a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year
so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so
that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
um-hum
yeah
yeah i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed oregon's plan or the oregon plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh
oh all the different uh
med- medical maladies that you can have
and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would
so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck
but um it [vocalized-noise] was an interesting show
i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing
uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be
um
just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh university of new hampshire handle it
um
great
is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh
professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or
right
um-hum
uh-huh
oh okay
right
yeah i'm kind of interested because i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree
is to uh is to teach in university
i'm a doctoral student in florida right now
but um
yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
oh is that right
[noise]
okay all right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i- i work for the university of new hampshire and uh
our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental
uh [vocalized-noise]
no i work in i'm in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i uh effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the university of new hampshire
uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh
the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get
we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off
yeah
right
uh-huh
um-hum
well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit
and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh
you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part
uh-huh
right
oh yeah
um-hum
huh
uh-huh
hum
right
right
um-hum
well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operat- for what we call operating staff which are
considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p. a. t. staff which i belong to
and but the main i think the hea- the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but
the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued
uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there
uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
college programs uh belong to this t. i. a. a. uh c. r. e. f. uh retirement fund
right and in the case of the university of new hampshire uh
[noise]
all right uh
excuse me
yeah
okay
all right so uh
yeah i
yeah
oh you think y- that we are paying too much
in taxes
um-hum
yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income
right a- are you you're a na- you're from uh the united states
but you worked over there for a couple of year
yes
[laughter]
right you talking about special projects in the u- in the us you mean now
okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that
um for what we get we're paying too much i would say
right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted
for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh mon- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste
right right typically um
you don't get a whole lot [laughter]
well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents patrick buchanan has a idea that says that
if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare
so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system
you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off
yes
well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure
uh-huh
yeah
right
hm
yes
yeah
um-hum
yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of atlanta
and we get taxed t- tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was
um i pay for a a local hospital uh grady hospital where a lot of
indigent people are go and get free care
and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i- i and a lot of other thing-
[noise]
did you uh did you have to wait very long
did you have to wait very long
oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number
[laughter]
they had
[laughter]
are americans still paying too much too many taxes
that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this
well no [laughter] i mean yes [laughter]
yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh
i think we're paying i i i used to live in sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do
yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is
yes i i'm from idaho actually
yeah yeah i wa- so when i was living in sweden i got uh an im- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic
and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much
i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um
things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that
it
[noise]
right
you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it
i can go
yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket
so
um it seems very expensive to me for what i get
no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
and uh welfare on
reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on
and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on
huh
don't know if i agree with that or not
i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason
although two years that does sound like quite a while
i don't know what do you think of that one
he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue
um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for president bush to uh see if he can
see if he can uh give the line item veto a try
and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while
but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how congress reacts to that
that'd be quite an exciting battle
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] okay toby this is brian white
and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that um
if you don't mind uh how do you feel about capital punishment
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that way it can be a d- a deterrent
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh great
the response yeah
uh
yes
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
yes
right
yes
right right i tend to agree with you uh i'm kind of uh torn between two items however i i definitely bel- believe in due process that if a person is found guilty
so that we're not ramrodding a a guilty verdict on them that it's uh up for review in uh the appeal process
however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that
there are people that are going to make sure that every t. is crossed every i is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now
not only in the courts is that costing us
money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and uh clogging up the courts but also
when the [vocalized-noise] uh
the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh
in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um
the-
yeah exactly [laughter] exactly
and the guy is as sound mind and and so forth he's he's not an idiot uh he wasn't acting i- i don't know you know in that case
we're we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information
and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly
that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels app- of appeal
uh under cert- certain circumstances
those circumstances would be
[noise]
well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered
um [noise]
it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh
if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a
a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done
that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality
everybody knows he did it
this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh ex- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be
and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision
uh [noise] they did it wrong [laughter] and it was just a very minor
very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again
that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me
and with [noise]
uh with with it being that way
it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it
the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead
here in georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole
if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well
and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder
uh
that just shouldn't be so [vocalized-noise] but [vocalized-noise] so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole
yeah
[noise]
there's video tape of it
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
[noise]
well [noise] my parents were both in them
and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make
because boy it really confines the uh the people
and uh
usually they don't care for it [noise] and kind of put you on a guilt trip
but uh have you had any experience with them
yeah
yeah
but it's still still not like home
[noise]
right
yeah
but uh you know and it's hard to really
know what kind of a home is run
unless you really know someone that's in there
and
[noise]
you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too
that uh [noise] yeah they may say it's real bad
uh just because they don't like it in there
whereas it's you know usually pretty good
uh [noise] uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh
oh god [vocalized-noise] entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever
yeah
and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it
because they don't eat that too well
and uh
go uh a- you always have to check it for cleanliness too
well you have to make sure they're clean
and they just had a incident in uh dallas here
where the guy's suing the nursing home
he came in at ten in the morning
check on his mom
and she was sick
and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said wha- is she sick
we didn't know that
and here she died two hours later
yeah
so you know
and [noise] w- there's an awful lot of variables in them
oh
well i think medicare and medicaid payments are uh
kind of tightening up on it
but uh
you know in some of them some of them try so d- hard
but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful
is ever ending
[noise]
well it's around the clock care
yeah an awful lot
and and gentleness too
yeah
costs a bunch
my mother-in-law is uh eighty two
and we'd probably put her in the same home that
[noise] think about what nursing home
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home
and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing
and uh it's uh
i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh
and a lot more personal but uh
no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen
people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home
that seems to be
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
well that's good
yeah
yeah
[noise]
i'm sorry what was that
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
uh oh
yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh
i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was
i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh
kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was
it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in atlanta that are closing down [noise] it's
apparently a shaky business right now
yeah
yeah
yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently
showing some signs of alzheimer's and uh she'll
my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so
yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience
but
yeah she [laughter] she's she's pretty good with them though she does a real good job
and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed
you know which is good
so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh
uh i i don't think i would
wanna
turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and [vocalized-noise] i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it
you know
[noise]
okay karen you're [vocalized-noise] you're first
uh-huh
okay
yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh
there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh
quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a
progressive path but
not being in the
say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
uh like
really [vocalized-noise]
yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh
a broader scope for rewarding people for
uh their performances
um so that's
in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution
uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
perhaps somewhat even with the business
uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are
one of the
big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh
security aspect for long term employment uh
job security yes
uh-huh
yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs
uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between
institutions and the corporate world
in uh institutions are slower to
react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses
we need to cut back that's what we do
but
yeah and institutionally like here at the university
oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not [noise] where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which
well in one s- sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
so we end
it's very easy
yeah
right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it
well
[noise]
the uh
uh th- that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess
uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution
uh the there is not much incentive for
innovativeness because the the limitation for reward is is very severe
but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
uh i guess in innovation although
he the you know the more complex your structure
the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
but uh i think there is uh
it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh
things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts
right
yeah you end up being your own person
and uh if you do your job fine and if
somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
you know you really
yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of
person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves
[noise] oh
okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement
you know not to get in like in a dead end job
and plus
for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental
they're also important
um
um
are they like we- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh
j- just very little variation from there
um-hum
um-hum
well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth
you mean security job security
um
that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know
if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess
but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and there's no doubt yeah
expedi- yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most
oh
oh see yeah
yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time when those people aren't there anymore
yeah
um-hum
yeah but so what else do you think is important
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team
uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i thin- you think you're just a number you know
um-hum
um-hum
whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it
get accomplished you know
um-hum
i think
let's see i di- i didn't hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didn't press it hard enough let's try again
[noise]
hum
right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not uh anyway i did press let me press one once again
[noise]
well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um
i uh use a uh a program on my macintosh which is called dollars and cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh
oh frisco texas uh gee i don't even know [laughter]
raleigh north carolina
[noise]
i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are
uh but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a pe- personal accounting program on my macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't
the case in in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i- i- i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give you more explanation
okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting
um-hum
i found that it was uh y- well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but
if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year [noise]
um
for macintosh yes
um it's called dollars and cents and actually the leading program is managing your monies by andrew tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up [laughter]
excuse me
it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um
you would make one [vocalized-noise] uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to
change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just
yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i never never really used any of them so
uh i- i- i read since then though that they've redes- rede- uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um
[noise] so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
right
um-hum
uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions
uh so so i- i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially
fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time
and uh
uh gee i pray my pay my cable t._v. annually
you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember [laughter]
but they say [laughter] i- uh they always forget you [laughter] every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years
so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but [laughter] now
now yeah now i know they are going to do that um
okay
ye- yes i'm sure that it
okay
well i- it just that that uh recording would begin when the person who called
presses one but
okay
[laughter]
oh i'm not in san francisco i'm in frisco texas
where are you
raleigh north carolina i thought you said rowlett [laughter] we have a little town out here yes okay you know where dallas is
oh okay i am fam- i am familiar with computers
no we don't my husband uh takes care of our finances and he just uh just does it all all manually he keeps uh a book sort of
he uh doesn't keep it on the computer i work with computers and we have one at home but he doesn't use it for that
right
and that is a software program that was written for your i mean that you
just for macintosh
too much detail
was it too much detail to it
primitive [laughter]
uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um
you know the the payments that are due when and uh [noise] what pays off when and uh of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh
home owner's is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just
sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money
um-hum
well that's nice
now you expect it [laughter]
[noise]
uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check [vocalized-noise] since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by
uh
um-hum
[laughter]
uh-huh
[noise]
oh yeah i can i can understand that [laughter]
[vocalized-noise] got one kid
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah i
[laughter]
yeah i understand that ri- right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now
through nursing school so it's kind of [laughter]
got to
maxed out right now but
we try to put a little away ever- every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and
we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on
he's five
yeah
yep
we- that's
yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones
uh u. t. a.
[vocalized-noise] uh
and you know
the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff
for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that
that adds more to the gas budget
do what ma'am
uh no she goes they have a class there every tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year
uh going to the hospital three times a week so
yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah i understand
that's the same problem we fall into you know
you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know
be with the kids a little bit during that time and
kind of a family deal
[noise]
well we
we try
it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use
if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
but um and then at the end of the year i- i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting
i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
[laughter]
do you have kids
one we don't have any because i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do
but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time
as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four o. one k. pan in a profit sharing
and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
because to me that's the only way we're ever going s- to be able to save
because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
oh yeah
that's very hard
um-hum
yeah they say how old is he
he's five they say by the time
kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college
and it's just unbelievable
you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything
um-hum where is she going
yeah
i'm sure it is
oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals
has she started doing any of work at the hospitals
yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an r. n. and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and
and all the things which was an added expense [noise]
but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father
living in a budget was no problem
it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's
you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and bef- you know
parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way
um-hum
um-hum
and it's hard
and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are [vocalized-noise]
credit card rates are still
sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent
[noise]
well how do you feel about trial by jury
in what way
[laughter]
[laughter] i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
um-hum
the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be
uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that
you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
um-hum
i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum [noise]
yeah i
i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sen- the well what i don't like about uh sen- juries doing the sentencing in that
i think it becomes a lot less th- th- the the same crime gets unequal sentences
i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know s- s- selecting a jury two two different juries that would
most of the time come up with the same idea [vocalized-noise] the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
but
i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
in trying to
gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that
that measure stick across the board
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
yeah i agree [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i- i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cann- they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their c- client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury
through argument that the
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh
yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
[noise]
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented
i have uh very little regard for the law
[laughter] that's presently practiced [laughter]
i was thinking primarily criminal cases
yes
um-hum that's a concern of mine uh
i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
um-hum
yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers
uh
uh too often i think they're not and uh when you y- when you are
selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh
they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has [vocalized-noise] doing sentencing without the jury [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise] i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either
you know the the plaintiff or the defendant uh the th- the full benefit of the law
and i guess that's what i am concerned with
um-hum
this is very true
um-hum um-hum
yeah and you do see such un- uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean
where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for some-
uh
isn't that the truth [laughter]
[noise] there are times when is it uh
oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh othello
you know where he says kill all the lawyers [laughter] every now and then one is tempted to feel that way
[laughter] but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of
you know am- as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
um-hum
and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved [vocalized-noise] sl- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off
uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
so i don't know [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
[noise] okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees
uh-huh
oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
would you [vocalized-noise] uh would you
do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay
yeah
um-hum
yeah
it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs
but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that
yeah
yeah
[laughter] and we're and we're getting
it does feel like it doesn't it
i know
well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring
doctors have been on drugs for years [laughter] from what i hear
you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it
the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it
right and yet the potential like
i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body
uh-huh
[laughter]
that's right that's right
[laughter] it's o- o- only old lady so and so from where ever and [vocalized-noise]
right
[laughter]
yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not su- i was trying to think in in history ha- have people checked that or did people just
did people just
accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before
um-hum
um-hum
right
[noise]
well i- i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be
you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's impor- whose decisions are important and [vocalized-noise] you know that's
that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work
as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if
yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision
when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're
if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever
then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining
what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights
that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's
if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking w- would they just you know i mean y- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people
the right to do what they need to do what they want to do
yes i okay i'm i'm i'm i- i think that's fine i think if you're if if it matters to you that much then
you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just
come back and and get you anytime you know i- i don't think it it could be surprise at your door here we are you know or
or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i- i don't know it's kind of [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
yeah it's it's really you don't
[noise]
yeah exactly
[noise]
yeah
um-hum it's yeah it's kind of a
[noise] do you trust me do you not trust me
you know it's i don't know i d- i don't know it's it's awfully it's it has it's points it's good points and it's bad points see
it kind of makes us look like we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world's going almost
you know i've walls are coming come in berlin and
we [laughter]
and here we are we're going the other way and
yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem
[noise]
[noise] oh yeah yeah
[noise]
yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so
uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility
you but i guess that's [laughter] more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself
it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to [vocalized-noise] if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well
it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or something [laughter] you kn- [noise]
[noise]
yeah yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't [laughter] you know no problem yeah i guess that's j- uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so
that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i- i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have gone downhill quite a bit since
earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts
you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so
[noise] well
yeah uh-huh
well i know we're kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so
the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now we have the uh legal injections lethal injection
and uh
it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death
and i think at this point i am for that as long you know as they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and
this i don't see why they should have to and why why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row
that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal
bit then
why continue [noise]
that's right
right i can agree with that that it's
right
yes
yes well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it they i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row
and
uh i think probably texas is the most lax state there is on this that it just [noise]
[laughter] oh wow we do everything else fast [laughter]
right [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh
i think that was in houston
yes uh-huh
i believe so and uh
i know we're going through a case right now that uh where parent's starved a child to death
and uh
i've heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not
uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this child
the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind
that these people ought to get the death penalty
that uh [noise]
they did it they did it knowingly
yes uh-huh
oh they the were just punishing they didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught they had two of them
uh-huh
two children one did not die
well could be [vocalized-noise]
well i don't think i would but uh
uh-huh
well you may have a point there i
it's just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but i've read so much about it and
[laughter] it just upsets me [laughter]
but but other than that uh you know i just
i just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said [noise]
you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what uh how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that
i honestly don't know what illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for texas
uh-huh
yeah i- i st- i i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal
and uh and i can see the the necessity of it
but uh
i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no que- if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then n- in everyone's mind it's not actually settled
so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt
and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent or where they've killed several people
yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it
is that right
oh wow
[laughter]
baby
that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because texas instruments is in texas and so
it's in the news it's not it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the dahlmer case
that that was in the news everywhere
now where was that at
so that was in texas too
that's what i thought
uh-huh
i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and
and were they were they punishing the kid and they didn't realize that he was going to die or oh they did
well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them
two chi- two children
one didn't
huh
yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids
that would that would s- that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that
well
no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide
yeah that's
that is
that is a tough one
[noise]
okay so what do you think about uh
uh health care for the elderly
[laughter]
right
[vocalized-noise]
all the bills
does that include um
nursing home type care
just strictly health care
right
right
that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good
hm
um
hm
right
so where d- does she well um
i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is [vocalized-noise]
right i guess
that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it she's not really
uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them
but she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own any longer
and that's that's kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children
right
yeah
yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh alzheimer's i guess
and so her memory is very poor [laughter] and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her [laughter]
um-hum
that's true
[noise]
well i've got a mom who is uh eighty six years old this year
and uh
sh- she
uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years s- actually six years and then she moved
uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house
uh i think health care for the elderly is uh
is uh its kind of a difficult
i say difficult i mean there's as your body is running downhill they can spend an infinite amount to keep you alive
and on the other hand it's kind of nice uh
if you're taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh
the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an h._m._o. they took all the money from from uh medicare
how should i say it uh this h._m._o. thing said uh had an agreement with medicare that said uh on the average you're gonna spend x. amount of dollars per year
so if you'll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills
no this is just you know standard
health care like you'd get from your employer
and uh
so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh
there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and
well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldn't cover but they like they bought her a uh
a uh
[noise] let's see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh
uh before that time she was always subject she she'd have these salesmen that would call and say hey if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for
three times the the real price uh medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didn't need
and then finding out that medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no medicare wouldn't pay for it
so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way
so how about you
no she's still she's staying with my uh actually she's staying with my
brother's son who's doesn't have teenagers [noise]
yeah
[noise]
yeah it was difficult for us to because uh
[noise]
well actually it it was all right as long as she could
could get back and forth to the uh you know to the bathroom and
things like that but when she go- when she got really sick and she couldn't move very much then it was exhausting absolutely exhausting
you know so [noise]
oh yeah
[noise] yeah uh and that [noise] to that extent i th- like i say this health care for the elderly is
is uh i- i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this
oh i don't wanna know fog so to speak uh we had uh a a baby fairly late in life and uh as soon as that baby came along uh
uh she paid a lot of attention to you know something to take care of i'll put it that way and something to pay attention to and and uh
the other thing i've noticed is that that uh pets and and uh
if they have pets to take care of uh like she got yeah she got uh
so uh
d- do you know what the laws of texas are in regard to capital punishment
i'm sorry would you repeat that please
i'm sorry you you're just a little [vocalized-noise] just a little quiet i just couldn't quite hear what you said
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and he i i'm uh
i believe in california it is permitted but for a few years they were
not doing it i don't think i don't think there's been an execution for a while uh but i'm a little ignorant of it myself i know that there was a
[noise] there was a state supreme court justice who was uh being pounded on in the newspapers because she was overturning
uh convictions or she was somehow keeping death penalties from being carried out and uh the newspapers were
giving her a very hard time on that although i always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on her about
well i
i don't to me it seems unnecessary
um
i think that the sort of person who
would be deterred
by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison
um
and uh
[noise]
it seems just with the possibility of
making mistakes that uh
i would rather opt for life in prison where at least there's a chance the person could uh either change or perhaps even
you know contribute to society from prison in some way
well what do you feeling [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[noise]
[noise] right it's uh
do you think it would be a deterrent
well that is true that is true um
uh-huh
oh i see you're thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be
[noise] maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of
of killing somebody
um
well you know i mean i think i think i'm in agreement with you on this point that hey there's a problem and
the solution to the problem isn't whether you kill people or not at the end it's what happens before that uh and i would say that uh
you know putting more
giving more attention to uh child rearing
you know as early as that i- is it the terms of giving kids a good education and uh
sort of a good uh
i don't know moral or self esteem sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in the first place
could make it less necessary also
yeah and that's i it seems like people uh
focus more on the one end of the system where you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not
uh
so i think that sort of goes along with what you're saying
uh
are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um i have to plead ignorant i really don't know i- i think that that uh i think texas is for it i don't think we've had any instances of it
pardon
oh okay
sorry i said texas is is for capital punishment um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but but it is
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment
[noise]
um-hum
well uh i probably tend to fa- come down on the side of of being for it but i- i think it
i- it shouldn't be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that you're you know no mistakes have been made
but then i- i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it
well obviously that person wouldn't do it again
[laughter]
and it but but i think that like i said i- if the laws that are already on on the books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law
then i think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime
um-hum
right because i- i think too many too many of them walk you know
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
well that's true you've got to have the foundation there
um well i think murder is number one
uh
i- i- i- i
tend to believe in an eye for an eye if you if you take a life then you need to lose yours you know not not that you can bring the other person back and and obviously can't
but i see no reason
to
for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know there's too much of
if you could put them away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing but
most of of the uh
murderers that go to jail get
[noise] i'm an avid recycler um but our city's not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there
uh-huh
uh-huh
you don't know yeah
right that they pick up
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
right
nobody wanted to do it
it do you have a place to take them
wow is that right
worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah
right
yeah oh i know i know it
[laughter]
now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper
oh really
d- with their claws or chew it
how fascinating
oh isn't that interesting i've got three cats but newspapers don't seem to interest them at all
oh no [laughter]
is that right oh my gosh
and then they learned how huh
well that's funny well i- i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in dallas to do some
uh curbside recycling they've got sp- special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about
you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and
everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there
uh then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of of a of a solution to a problem
and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything so
back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uh-huh yeah well that's good
and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i
oh i even carry around uh you know like if i- i- i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating [laughter] in the car or on the way to the next site
and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to live
[vocalized-noise] we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and
uh-huh
ye- right ex- exactly lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place
yeah
that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in [laughter] because it just leaves me with having to dispose of it
no please no
yeah
and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and
cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it
right
but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah
yeah yeah i know and i- and it it really is hard and and uh i then i'll fill up the back of my car and i'm driving around with trash in my car and tha- well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing
you know because [laughter] they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash [laughter] anyway
[noise]
there is a group in town called nacogdoches recycles that will meet i believe it's once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers
or bottles
but it's up to you to collect them it's up to you to get them down there and then what they do with them i don't know
there isn't any y- somebody had had talked once before to city council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans
uh-huh because they do that in palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that
and i save aluminum cans and
to take those to the to the closest place is about
it's about thirty minutes away
yeah and it and the last time we took some things
the price is not really
worth it [laughter]
yeah yeah because by the time and you save them and squish them and
[vocalized-noise] they're just they were everywhere
and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day
destroyed those
mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up
um-hum both
i don't know what it is
i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on on the coffee table or it's chewed up
and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on
uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time
yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would
that's true
oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store
uh-huh
but but as far as bottles and things go there isn't any place any any close
yeah yeah
um-hum
it really is
yeah i i've started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things [vocalized-noise]
and i save all the little condiments and things and i
yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator
exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not
but i- i- try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but
that's
yeah and i've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room
yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is
yeah
[laughter] and that's true
[noise] well i definitely think taxes are too high
uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now
and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the boston tea party and the american revolution was exorbitant taxes
but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridi- you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes
uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing
you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
uh-huh
oh really
get out of my room
interesting
sure
my my feeling about at least i i don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here
uh some of the public schools get more funds than
the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say carver high school in atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student
but the best private school
is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the s._a._t. etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money
just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and
[laughter]
yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um
uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which
all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction
meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up
uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools
went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh
yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh
on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending
a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in europe and asia uh we have no business spending that money
and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a presidential candidate forum here
last saturday and ju- we just had our primary in georgia and uh
uh you know i i one of the questions i asked the representative of bob carey who was there was uh
and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year
what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he ta- and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabi-
well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh
here in my state uh
yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax
and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically no- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here
yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of washington per uh per student
is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low
uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the seattle area we've got a lot of uh
uh high technology industries we've got microsoft here well microsoft expects well educated employees
but uh you know microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh
towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's
you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh
uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well
well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff
yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that
[noise]
well jackie uh on taxes i i'd guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is that i'd do think that americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that
right
uh
where you live do y- you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
uh uh-huh
yeah in new hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax
uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent
and we have uh what we call the five b's uh [vocalized-noise] for our taxes
booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling
so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
well that's nice
nice t- nice to get a refund
uh-huh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we're getting value for it
yeah
uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
you know what i mean
uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because
right because uh y- there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you
[noise]
um-hum
that's it
um-hum
well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know
um [noise] i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax
uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amou- i mean you you take your total salary
uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had
and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after y- you know after you uh figure out [noise] you know who's in your family
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the irs and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know
yeah
i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a l- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but
i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans
[noise] i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
doesn't seem fair to me
right
right i think your taxes in wisconsin are pretty high i- i- if i'm not mistaken aren't they
i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is
twenty percent
just
you just pay it huh [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
[noise]
i agree i think taxes are high
um yes uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh
right
yeah i ag- i agree [vocalized-noise] i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting
um well if you do get money back from [noise] like jobs like i'm still a student so um i only work part time so i- i get a check back
from from taxes but
yeah it is but [laughter] it's not much [laughter]
so
no
yeah
yeah
yeah there you go
[laughter]
right
yeah i don't know i don't doesn't seem like they're doing much with it neither i mean there's plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i me- they have nice plans and
um but [laughter] they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised
i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don- really understand it but
it's just
you know [laughter]
right
um-hum
hm
right huh
yeah that could be nice [laughter]
huh
right
yeah
right
hm
yeah it isn't there's not much out there that's fair that's for sure [laughter]
huh i'll agree to that
um
um no i i have no idea i just
my dad does it all for me
[laughter] i use
um-hum
y-
[noise]
okay how do you keep up with current events
yeah what what channel do you watch or what station
that's the one i watch i usually keep up with t._v.
i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
too great sometimes
yeah the radio doesn't really have much
news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music
yeah do you think that t._v. is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
yeah
[laughter]
yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news
huh
yeah
going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for
you know actual news
i think you know the
probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
they
typically have a better i am from a small town too here in texas
and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and
yeah farm report and oil reports
that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who
yeah
well in um in dallas um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's
and the story was uh
yeah and the news covered it
right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who
had everything and then like three days later this [vocalized-noise]
local news station was using as a as their promo
to promote themselves i just thought that was really
that's kind of cold
yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
it real personal moment
yeah it didn't seem like there was like much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions
it's just gotten so i mean
somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite days you know
[noise] and everything
yeah
yeah
yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war
did you
yeah
they kept just showing [vocalized-noise] you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually
the damage that really happened that's
a lot of times [vocalized-noise] like the news coverage showed all the you know guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know
got really hurt and everything and
[noise]
um well actually usually um [noise] in the mornings i am getting ready to either to go to work um usually catch the news in the morning
uh n._b._c.
um-hum
yeah
yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know t._v. um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like
yeah [noise] what [noise] what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to like an all news station to get any news at all
well i- i really don't like about t._v. especially local news as compared to like national news is just
[noise] um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed
and you know it's
it's more like the news shows is now i- is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
or like the news because they would always have you know the the wonderful investigative reports you know is is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know
um-hum
yeah also also i have the observation with um
with the press is that like any any stories that
i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life
you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had
more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
it's something wrong
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the farm report
um-hum
um-hum [noise]
yeah also i have um founded like in
newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know
[noise] read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and
was that like [vocalized-noise] he like started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know [vocalized-noise]
you know channel x. gives you the best coverage [noise] you know we were on the scene with our team players you know
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
yeah
yeah i have
you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
um [noise] you know even the national news i just find it to be you know
very watered down very
um
i fou- [vocalized-noise] i found it very one sided
um
you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
um you know you know not saying that we shou- that we that we definitely should have been there or we shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that
the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
[noise]
okay i guess we're recording now so
i think they could uh
uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff
and then they get paid for recycling it so [laughter] i don't know
if that's very fair or not
um
oh
yeah
yeah well that's
[laughter] that's for sure
uh
well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to wal-mart because they use to have a recycling bin
and but they got rid of them because there's a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so
yeah
yeah
yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all
or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just
[vocalized-noise]
oh yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i've heard
yeah
yeah
yeah and uh an- you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just
yeah
yeah that's
yeah
[noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
[noise]
yeah
yeah
well
dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month
is what we are going to have to pay
uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid
maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and
something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and
nowadays it's like i i can't find one place that's going to take everything
and i am trying to recycle my ki- my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and that's not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way
of
doing that but uh
yeah
and they just got rid of them well kroger's uh at least in dallas kroger's
will pay for aluminum and will collect
the glass and the plastic
but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard
and i know that the place at galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there
so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but it's you know i have to run around town to get my stuff recycled
yeah uh
well i use to it use to be a good deal us to gi- instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and
they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them
some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and
but know it's just
you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but
you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise
that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle
you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get recycled
well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff
yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance
and to define recycle paper as paper that includes
you know
material that had actually been used as paper before
one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends
you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes
well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber
and they call that recycled paper
you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to
you know how to clean up [vocalized-noise]
dave what kind of pets do you have
one rotten cat
i heard a laugh in the background
[noise]
[laughter]
oh you don't like cats
oh yeah
that said what does how does he treat the other people
wow
[laughter] did he raise him or something
[laughter]
uh-huh
huh that's interesting
huh we have a a mutt well we we named it hooper because that's where we got it from [laughter] uh some lady
she uh a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house
and she used to work for a veterin- veterinarian so she would spay uh neuter them
give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've i've had
and we got it because well my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i'm away at work
um yeah right now it it is it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but right now we haven't had any but
it's pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes [laughter]
uh my brother has um we didn't do a lot with them um i never felt it like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything
but i mean it's a bit more responsibility
when it's yours and not your brother's [laughter]
but
um-hum
that's what we found ours is uh like a cockapoo i think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle but it's a really good dog
i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred
[laughter]
uh-huh
would you ever want a dog in the family
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
wow
they just need a lot of ti-
[noise]
oh we have one rotten cat
[laughter]
yeah it's my son's cat
[noise] yeah that's the boys they they know i don't like it [laughter]
well i like cats this cat is a uh more like a dog
yeah he's uh a a one owner
he likes one boy in the family and that's about it
just uh stays away or runs
usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around
you know when he's in the house he'll come up and he'll jump on his lap
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are you doing
and
he he's ye- we bought the cat for him and so he's he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him
but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
so it's a weird cat [laughter]
a mutt
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
[noise]
uh-huh
so that is that kind of your child right now
you feel like
[laughter]
oh uh-huh
have have you had dogs before
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
well i just um [vocalized-noise] we've you know when i was growing up i had we always had a dog
and we had mostly well not not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
no no it's just uh
an accident [laughter] from a frie- from uh my son's friend down the street their their cat
was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and
um we i would we um
we had a dog that was a um
mix between a an alaskan malamute and a labrador
and [vocalized-noise] i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him and we
when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten
he was jus- he was just too big um the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school
and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just the- you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post
so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called shorties lane out here in harrisville and they have um
i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him
um
because he's had him for six or seven years we we've
saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life
just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great great dog
[vocalized-noise] this recycling it's uh i don't know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in arlington about it uh they have a trial section that uh
part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out
i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh that's inter- the grocery stores here have usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things
uh-huh
we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here
but i don't i would not know where to take glass
oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place
um-hum
yes i know and we have that problem [laughter] but uh
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
hum
yes
oh that's a good idea
oh
but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
right uh-huh uh-huh
my goodness
huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh
[noise]
so
right
right here in philadelphia the
city for residential customers has certain they [vocalized-noise] had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers
and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list
but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
you on the first and third saturdays of every month you take your
bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood
and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh
it use to be a firehouse
but they're trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the university of pennsylvania where i'm a grad student
and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic
and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing
right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
um
uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that
right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from um a standpoint of making new paper to recycle
but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
down home i know my folks
um
live in south carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they'll just won't have to build landfills as often
another things that they are doing not at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and
that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
from the miscellaneous paper
and well they also [vocalized-noise] recycle aluminum cans
they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my o- my oil changed when i go down to south carolina there has been a goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years
and they have pretty economical rates but now in south carolina there is this
mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy w- would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts
so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh goodyear store won't even
they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
so the only way you can get in south carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law but you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself
[noise]
so uh have you personally been involved in any trial by jury
uh
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah i was called uh once and i actually sat on a jury and it took a few weeks
the case was suppose to the judge predicted it would take a few days
and it just stretched out and stretched out and uh it was kind of interesting
to uh in a in a in a way that kind of satisfied my uh or that pandered to my nosiness
-cau- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other
and uh you were invited to you know pass judgement on them
[laughter]
well in this case we determined the award
um it was two fellows a bunch of money had had uh passed from one to the other and we had to decide uh
was it -as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back
uh was it you know what was it and if it was something if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe
and not only how much was
how much did they owe but on top of that did we want to penalize them
uh
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's certainly what they're trying to do right
uh at least there are two of them
uh knocking off
i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them
so maybe maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with
maybe
it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better
[laughter]
[noise] yeah that seems like uh it seems like you'd have to ig- either ignore that i mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an opinion
uh-huh
uh-huh
they got to have a problem
yeah yeah
yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing
uh-huh
right i mean you want people who are
engaged [laughter]
uh-huh
uh well tha- that was one nice thing about the civil case
is that it it was nothing that
had shown up in the papers you know it was just two guys the
what they the only thing they looked for was if you had been in a similar situation yourself
and i guess they figured you
you know
you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with
it does seem like the judge has a lot of power in the first place and why give him this part also
uh-huh
[noise]
uh no i've never been [noise] called for jury duty which i'm kind of glad for i think it it'd be kind of nice to actually experience it uh but no i haven't i have never how about you
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
so when you did it does the jury actually uh d- determine the sentence
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well it seems like the the whole process i don't know a whole lot about it but one thing that i would think is is when the attorneys actually go through the selection of the jury process
seems to me that that would that kind of biase- i mean they have control over well we want this person and we don't want this person here and it seems like that could kind of bias the case toward you know their client
right
right
right which
an equal balance
i- i don't know the the whole process i it's a good process i mean it i gue- our country's based on [laughter] trial by jury
yeah i really do also i mean the forefathers whoe- whoever came up with the idea s- they were surely thinking a lot harder than i can think [laughter]
but uh it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the manuel noriega trial i don't see how they could have found anybody in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case
yeah it is that's that's one of the things that's the reason why they will often change venues of court and stuff like that to get a jury which doesn't have any any uh bias towards the case
and it it uh it just seems like sometimes the people that they're going to end up with have got to be just your basic you know schmucks
yeah it- to not know anything about you know or not have formed any type of opinion about some of these large major cases that we've been having lately
it just seems like tho- i guess that's the one thing that i would think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just
that's right be-
because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the people themselves well either they sit in a little hole you know for all their life and don't hear about anything going on in the world and i don't see how somebody like that is going to be a very good uh
i don't kn- f- form be able to form a very coherent opinion about
r- yeah right and that seems to be the opposite of what they they actually have to look for
so
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right and as far as the i don't think that the uh sentencing should be left up to the judge because that just that w- that gives too much power to any one person
right
yeah that just i mean for for one person i'm s- sure they have studied the law and ha- been involved in it for so long but still i think it's this is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind of a joke
but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones the crime was against society it ought to be society as a whole you know tha- uh as represented by the jury
[noise] how do you feel about gun control
um
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] well don't you think that you know just having you know some
you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know
you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry
i mean
it varies from state to state
there is no national
uh in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon
you know or on probation or [vocalized-noise] you know
other obvious things like that
uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before
[noise] you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun
uh
uh yes i'd probably i'd probably say about a five
[laughter]
[laughter] seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh [noise] well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like
you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like england and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing you know p- per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states
uh
[noise] you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the united states has you know had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long
that i think you know if you were introduced
you know any controls
it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already
you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem
uh
i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up
uh
um-hum
i mean like i think you know in the [vocalized-noise] i mean i- i think we have been like ranked in like one of the top three for murders in the last few years
uh-huh
no i've i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something
i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun [vocalized-noise] just for protecting myself
you know from you know burglar type thing like i do kind of live in the downtown area
you know and shotguns are really good because you know they're
[noise] i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
uh and you know you
yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
they are probably going to miss the person and they're going sh- and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit hit someone you know
i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever
you pretty you pretty much stop them and you don't have to w- you know y- and then and then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that that's they yeah that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know
if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you
you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then
you know and and well i mean
you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you're a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know
stop you [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something
uh-huh
[noise]
well uh
i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed
but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns
and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen texas not too long ago
but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh i mean prevent that
yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now
um
but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
yeah
huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary
so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
that's where i would probably be
well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better
because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again it's just like all those nutcases out there
it has
because [vocalized-noise]
hum
yeah
well is the crime that bad there in atlanta
yeah i know dallas is
i don't know if dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun
uh-huh
yeah
that's true
[laughter]
yeah
well
well now when i first moved to dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because
you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it
[vocalized-noise]
and they get it from you uh-huh
set them off
yeah
[noise] well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know
i don't want it if i don't know how to oper- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility
so
well well uh
did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever
yeah right
that kind of
i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns
i would be scared selling guns to people
[noise] what do you do there in lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah wha- what would be more efficient about it wha- wha-
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
i see yeah i- i- i- i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if
if i have a if i- i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
that's true
hm
certainly that's a good idea
yeah
uh-huh
well um as far as ti's concerned i'm not sure um and
uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in plano
um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up
where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up
uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper [noise] uh and uh aluminum and um
the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items
um-hum
um-hum
well wh- what what kind of uh services do you have there in lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i- i lived in abilene for a uh i went to school there at abilene christian and i it was so hard to uh
you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible
hm
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
well that's good
yeah
uh-huh
do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or
um-hum
hm
um-hum
sure yeah
[noise]
well you know they actually started and i assumed it was t._i. wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um
less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i- i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in [laughter]
um
[noise] well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or [vocalized-noise] a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them
and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
kind of type thing so
right
but [noise]
right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and
i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible [laughter]
so um what else do they do in the dallas area
uh-huh
hm
anything extra
that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where
you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh [noise]
there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um
[noise] so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most
uh but
[noise]
find a place [noise]
well um
[noise] uh
they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans
those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town
um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
um but i- i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments
so
[noise] i do that i think people are becoming more aware
you know of of the waste and you know i- i like to see you know y- you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
you know like maybe it's making an impact [laughter]
i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start
packaging it that way
so um
you know they're getting away from the styro-
[noise]
okay so frank what uh type of uh
budget do you or your family have
right that's
that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have [laughter] i'm single so i guess
uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
right i don't need to [laughter]
i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh
i kind of
i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month
and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah that's
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m- uh medium or longer range i just have a
maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car
so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to
to [vocalized-noise] put a little bit away and
you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever
right
um-hum
hm
right
right
have you thought about uh leasing
i see
right
but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that
you know typically you [vocalized-noise] if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
that's right [laughter] yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had ex- a number of expenses
but uh i'm hoping that
m- most of them were just kind of uh you know the
as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year
and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again [laughter]
right
right what line of work are you in
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh
my wife uh
has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and
uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month
uh-huh
uh-huh
really don't need to [laughter]
uh
that's right
um-hum
uh-huh
right
well i found that uh you know thing- as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to v- have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh
you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -ill come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance
uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
and i guess that's a way of budgeting
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too
um
you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so
we're on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so
it's
y- you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that
uh you're on- you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying
well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so
[noise]
yeah i guess uh
uh-huh
right
yeah you're right um i- i have uh been know to keep
trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know
[laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month
[noise]
okay what's your view
what's your view
yeah [laughter]
yeah that's true
you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
i don't know coming from texas you're probably
i don't know i- i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
yeah
oh you're just living down there
yeah
oh well
[laughter]
yeah well
i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and
man there's no way there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know [vocalized-noise]
yeah it doesn't sit with me very well [laughter]
i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know
yeah i just about all well i live in minneapolis and
i well actually i live in florida but i am staying in minneapolis for a year
and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then
of course there's the hunting issue so
yeah that's good but what do you do jeff
oh yeah
all right
yeah
i'm uh researcher of honeywell up here
so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or
yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit
yeah
all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while
and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but
i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh
for a complete
that's right
i guess i am about eight or nine [laughter]
yeah no doubt about it but uh
yeah
yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it
t- to people that that i don't know [vocalized-noise]
they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period
where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually
uh i know it's this way in florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week
and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea
uh
and that's i don't know
that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always will be able to get around
yeah it's one of those things
but uh
i don't know i guess
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like
i'm not real sure why anybody would need
a fully automatic weapon
you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
[vocalized-noise]
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
[laughter]
you know it's like
what can you do with that that you can't do
in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot clip
you know you might do the same thing
and so it's like i don't know i- it it does it takes the sport out of it
for me i would much rather have a bow any time
[laughter]
yeah i- i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know
but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
but uh i don't know
anyway that's about where i stand
[laughter]
you uh
have you uh you eaten yet or whatever
is it seven o'clock there
you guys central
oh okay
oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are
people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so
i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to
[noise]
all right
huh
[noise] well
i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns [laughter]
personally
i mean
that's right that's right
yeah it is but i'm not really from [laughter]
i'm not really from texas i just live down here now i've i've lived down here a couple years
i'm or- originally from colorado but
yeah there there uh there's a lot of hunters here [laughter]
uh-huh
i just think i i think it's ridiculous i mean
really
uh-huh
right
right
sure
uh i
i'm in uh program control for a company up here
yeah
we do schedules
pro- programs schedule programs what do you do
oh okay
uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here i don't own a shotgun but i'd like to go bird hunting
so
yeah uh when i was in colorado we went
dear and elk hunting
y- you know quite a bit but
one for a total ban and uh
yeah i- i'll agree with you there
i mean
if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't
i you know i'm not for it
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] sure
yeah i don't either [noise]
yeah i fully auto but even well
i mean a semiautomatic
i guess that's
yeah right
sure
right
oh really
yeah
sure
me too yeah i am about the same way
yeah
uh yeah it's about seven fifteen
how is the weather up there
is it
right
yeah
[noise]
okay
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum what about glass they have glass
huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting
um i mean no- not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um
they have trash sorting and you know they [vocalized-noise] put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins
and uh [laughter] i guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like
they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they collect
um-hum
um-hum
i see so so um do you actually live in atlanta
um-hum
yeah i know the cities are um i think dekalb
dekalb yeah dekalb and fulton
i thought it was i thought it was a k. i always thought it was a k. but um never mind um
and uh isn't fulton what another county that's uh
um-hum um-hum
huh
now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over um more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
in fact and san francisco is entirely within the [noise] the the limits of san francisco county in fact san francisco county and city have the same city limits
so that's kind of a weird thing but um
um-hum
[laughter] yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it
huh
huh
um-hum
right
huh
huh
you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um where're you from originally
no kidding
[noise] [vocalized-noise] i'll talk about my city a little bit
[vocalized-noise] i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh
uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers
so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim tha- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans
uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area
at least when it comes to like uh coke and pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass
uh-huh
right
right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is
it seems like the paper sorting you st- we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department
so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual i- it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything
uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call atlanta central but there's several counties that count as atlanta
you well that's dekalb actually it's [vocalized-noise] you're right it's spelled that way d. d. e. c. a. l. b. but that that's dekalb [laughter]
right fulton and actually also contained in that is cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the atlanta proper
uh but there's no concentrated concept
uh on that sense uh we have uh
yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in fulton almost exclusively
uh but yeah i mea- i- i uh most cities tend to stay most- mostly i- [vocalized-noise] in in one county so you know
[laughter]
right
anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we ge- we get some help with the papers uh ou- our our uh
uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them in a bag they will put them in a separate area into into the uh uh
uh ga- garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that
[laughter]
well it pre- well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh
the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it
uh but they but they they do indicate that service
i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container
that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores
uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier
i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that
well i'm actually originally from dayton ohio
but that's
uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the houston chronicle and sometimes i'll read uh like the uh
uh wall street journal or the new york times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it um how about you do you you mostly get news from t._v. or newspaper
oh uh that's interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting
[noise] oh i-
[noise] is it is it the a._p. news wire or is it uh something that's that's a little bit different from that
uh okay so that that that's interesting okay yeah i've had i had access in the past to uh [noise] uh the a._p. news wire and i found that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news
um i've never uh used the dow jones news wire
but uh yeah it uh do you do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
yeah [noise]
uh interesting in what way in like in sort of like uh a qua- a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
g- you well you won't offend me so go ahead and say
yeah like li- a liberal type of bias
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but
yeah
yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things
yeah yeah
yeah
[noise]
hm
hm that's disturbing uh
i haven't really noticed them doing that but
whatever again i don't watch t._v. news that much now if i had access to c._n._n. i would watch t._v. news more um i don't you know but i don't usually yeah
yeah did you did you think that c._n._n. well the gulf war coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just won- i guess
i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say c._n._n. t._v. news compared to the three networks
um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i- i guess you wouldn't [noise] you probably if you just watched it during gulf war that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
yeah
yeah [laughter]
[noise]
[noise] ye- i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks
however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the wall street journal most everyday
[noise] uh well w- dow jones for example have a has a uh a news wire and it's uh it's picked up and actually available um at my office
so it's no fee subscription i'm uh very easy to to read at my leisure and um it's sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics
[noise] well it's similar to that but it's dow jones which is um the wall street journal's news wire
[noise] um well actually not uh i do uh follow um [noise]
uh
[noise] uh i don't know how to how to describe it um [vocalized-noise]
[noise] so it's a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly [noise] but uh but not um
but not like business week or uh or news week or or or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however um that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
[noise] um i- i think that it i think it has to do with [noise] uh [noise]
[noise] i personally think [noise] i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh [noise] that there's a strong bi-
there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media
yeah absolutely a- after all wh- who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal
[noise] uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm
an expert in i find their descriptions to be
wrong
and
it
that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies
[noise] i- i think both uh by deliberate um [vocalized-noise] i mean mist- mistakes of omission or uh [noise] or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have
[noise] so uh uh well give an example uh y- y- we'll go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where they'll show clippings from
one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you
which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know a._b._c. does that
yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and uh it wa- i did during the gulf war and it was addictive
[noise] yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get
the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on c._n._n. and you w-
[noise]
so what do you think about uh employers screening
you know job candidates for drug drug usage
right
right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening
but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it
right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um
if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh
right
yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um
that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't
fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people
right they can go and
right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance
um-hum
true
right
right
right yeah
that's true yeah
i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company
and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine
no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing
um-hum
right
well uh
right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very
well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems
[noise]
well i can kind of see it both ways because um
you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs
that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening
right i think that we ought to be [vocalized-noise] employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that
and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would li- rather have somebody that isn't on drugs
that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job
that
if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get it
right i guess depends on the job some jobs that de- on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains
um things like that but i don't think s._e._p._t._a.
actually [laughter] does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs
right
but other well i don't know
every job
right i guess
i don't know i'd would
obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging people
that's right
that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that
if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed
so
well some perhaps a program but
i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support
but on the other si- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they
especially young people here in philadelphia
if they had [vocalized-noise] if they were so busy during the day that when they went
um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep
so
but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them into trouble
[noise]
um-hum
right are you in business
uh-huh
right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in south carolina and hiring people and
you know even at fast food restaurants and um
field work it's
the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who
i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like philadelphia [vocalized-noise]
right
um-hum yeah they can [vocalized-noise]
[noise] so do you have kids in the public school system
oh yeah [laughter] well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh
i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um
home schooling right now is not an option for us so
and p- and private schools um i don't know yeah so you have to deal with it wh- what you have but um
um
i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems
yeah
[noise]
[noise]
yeah
yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um
they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching
and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with
um
you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that
w- [noise] well he works for frito-lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new i._b._m.
um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um
as a lot well i- industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period [noise] with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i w- we went and looked at the
the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into
and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like
um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know
that don't have
you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout
you know his school life if he's of uh you know that things are available to him like the computer that he can
go off and and teach himself yeah because i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um
[noise] they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time
and um
[laughter] i come back and
i got a degree in in uh i got a business degree in college and that's the most useless degree in the world it's like why did they do this to people [noise] and um so you have to you know you have to
uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to
to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um
yeah
um-hum
[noise]
uh no i don't i'm a college student actually no kids yet
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
pretty expensive [laughter]
right
uh
i think there's a lot that could be done to improve them i uh
being that i'm in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just see- it seems like
that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that a- that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that
i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age
and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your
your math professors or whate- whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well [laughter] you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it
it just seems like that they've
the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh [noise]
right
right
right
work at his own pace
[noise]
right
uh-huh
right
right
well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of
hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the church or somewhere else
dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i- i see that they're they're trying to uh
uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not
on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and
as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing
[noise]
hi ed
do you uh work for a large organization
wow what do you do
are you
i see
yes
i'm a computer scientist
and always concerned about benefits [laughter]
oh you are
i see uh
what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care
oh yeah
yeah
well we've our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider
and the [laughter] you wouldn't believe the complaints
because [vocalized-noise] you know you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network
and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you don't go to a network doctor
that's right
that's right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors
no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better
when uh
we are with the preferred provider yes
have you heard about uh ca- the cafeteria plan of benefits
[laughter]
well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in see- in learning more about that because
uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something [laughter]
yeah
yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you
well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much [laughter]
medical insurance or something i don't know [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah i'm sure but
uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldn't care about dental insurance
would you
i don't know
yeah
that's right
but that you know people like
[noise]
hello carolyn
yes i work for north carolina state university which has about six or seven thousand employees
i'm an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science
and you work for t._i.
and you do
um-hum
right well i i'm on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so that's why i checked that topic
i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um
[noise]
yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university
and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um
[noise]
uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh- you know the the uh
[noise]
uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly
uh-huh
huh
right
well
do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not
huh
right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right
with the preferred provider
huh
wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when hmo's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs
and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into hmo's are are those that have uh
you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the h._m._o.
so you get the people in the h. o. they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh
you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh
yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh
if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more
so
oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um
medical care
[laughter] i don't know about that [laughter]
you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total
yeah
uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to
uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly
uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation
[noise]
okay
um what do you think
well that makes a big difference doesn't it [laughter]
it's kind of like well if they're
right a little more domestic there
yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is american versus non american and while i'd really like to buy american
i don't know it just it really depends on reliability for me
uh i have a ford right now and it's been a pretty good truck
but some of the things are not that good about it and ford sales have been really bad in terms of cu- uh customer service at least for me
so it's i don't know i- it's kind of disappointing
but
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
right
well one of the g- i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father he's a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years
and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years
and uh he generally goes with i think the astro van
um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but
i don't know i guess i guess for my next car i'd probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that i'm a college student right now i'm a doctoral student
and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so [laughter] you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but
well i guess i don't know i'm i- i think i'll probably buy american but i'm just not real sure you know
um-hum
sure and i [vocalized-noise]
yeah
and that opens up a whole -nother can of worms i guess ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in california
you know
yeah
um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i
sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
i bet they'd have something to say about buying cars huh
yeah
oh really
[laughter]
how old are they
oh i see
uh-huh
right
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah
oh yeah
yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually
yeah
yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree
and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but
um-hum
yeah
it's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately you know it seems like everyone that's a big concern now you know it's
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
[noise]
well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house [laughter]
we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van
yeah
yeah
well well when we [vocalized-noise] i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy american and i went and looked at all the american ones
and the doors didn't close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and you're thinking to yourself if it's not right now what is it gonna be like after i've had it for six months
[noise] so
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
[noise] yeah
you have to go out of here go talk to dad
yeah
well um
i know i- i've always looked for mileage
uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job it's doing burning stuff up
uh
yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving
go away from here
just a minute
david remove jeffrey from my presence i'm on the telephone
well my my kids oh my kids think it's great we've [vocalized-noise] unfortunately our convertibles have been retired for l- lack of time on our part to um
to work on them but we have a f- an old fiat and an old m._g._b.
sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars
jeffrey hasn't figured out yet just you know it's like who want oh jeffrey's only three you know and th- but the other ones aren't very old either
so it's like who's going to inherit you know jeffrey's like well you know station wagon a mini van you know you got to go get another old convertible my hu- well my husband would love to buy next is a miata
you know is the mazda miata
it's suppposed to be
really solid car we have a a mazda right now
yeah
oh neat
well it they have something that
you know i there's some things i like better about my subaru and some things i like better about the mazda and uh you know and i'm always looking at that kind of thing at other people's cars and
yeah it i-
well it's not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open
so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean that's a nuisance that's a real pain
yeah um and one of them only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other
[noise] well do you have children
you don't have children
and my children are in their twenties now so
child care is something that i- i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard
at the time just finding finding sitters i
did not work though so i didn't have to uh
have to worry about you know
all day during the day which i think is a real problem
uh-huh
oh boy
no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it
instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know
that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money
and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing
and you we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and
people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening
and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do
yeah
do you know how much it is
yeah
yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know
a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah [noise] that's right well i- i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if
what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be
a good place and uh do they
do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know
uh-huh
y- you haven't decided yet huh
no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and
there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't [vocalized-noise]
didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh
it felt good to be there when they got home from school
um those were the stories that
that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to
get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then
later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing
oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera
but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career
you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a a real question
and uh do you know uh
you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both
uh-huh
uh-huh
well what about you and your own background di- did your mother or father stay home or di- did they work or
and so you so you were in school
and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened
i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or
do you remember
so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah
yeah cause i think that's another
[noise]
no
no
oh
yeah
[noise]
yeah i agree uh
cause [noise] i suppose when when i do start having children uh
i'd like to stay home for a while but uh
you know eventually i'd i might have to put them in day care to work
and i think it's hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in milwaukee um
they're closing down a day care because um
th- the lady who owns it um slapped a child
and um she had a lot of um
like um
um what did she have um like
tickets against her um saying that the she didn't have proper food um prepared for them
and that it was just dirty and
and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that
right
right
um-hum
um-hum yeah
right or you have to um
it's pretty expensive [laughter] i
the college i go to they have uh child care
um there but you still have to pay
you know it doesn't come with them
no i don't
[laughter]
right it's like uh uh if you do work [laughter] most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so
you might as well stay home if you're married [laughter]
right
yeah i've i've heard a lot of things about that too um
with some people say [noise] it's not healthy for your children to be in day care
and you know other's say it is so i don't know [laughter]
no
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah that is it's a tough decision
um-hum
um [noise] i think it's
f- for the students
yeah i don't know if it wou- it's it makes sense to have it for the teachers too
but um
i'm not really sure i haven't looked into [laughter] i don't need it [laughter]
um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and
she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after
right
um
[noise] for a while she was there
um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so
yeah um-hum yeah there was already somebody home
[noise] okay well uh i guess since i called i'll start out with my feelings about it uh i think that it's absolutely essential that some so- at least some employees
of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like
uh for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it uh i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling
uh-huh
yeah
right [laughter] or northwest i think northwest has had a lot of problems with that
i uh i've been in uh two two situations where i've had to under go grug test- drug testing i was in the military for a number of years
and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh
in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs
and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it
i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um
um-hum
uh-huh
right
right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's wh-
that's probably why they justified it
no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you
right
right
yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else
uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you
uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh
[noise]
um-hum
well uh i- i- it it becomes sort of a a topic where i sit there and and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a a reaction after i think about it a little longer uh
for me i i guess i feel like uh we have w- w- that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a
a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated
uh i think you're right about uh certain jobs and uh certainly something like uh a bus train pilots
uh it's obviously something that's a necessity it because it because the function of the job is is within all e- pretty much everyone in the world
uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities
okay
and like so i guess in some ways i'm agreeing with you
uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an eastern pilot to
uh have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly
right
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry
uh something wh- wh- see you're talking about a plant where okay if you're a nuclear inspector
or where you're a uh person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense
but uh we're talking about y- you know you're saying well uh and i think you uh that you just stated the same thing that if you were a cler- y- y- you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now where's the justification
wh- wh- what okay you know [laughter] let's say that we can y- y- y- you had had a uh uh you went to a party and
uh not not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot uh now how is that going to make any difference
you know unless you ve- unless you uh uh p._c._p. does exist apparently in the blood stream
for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be
uh very it it's very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you
right
[laughter] so bu- i i just went through one recently
and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the
there's really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean uh
it's a company that
it's basically a oh
management engineering company
now
w- wait but then but then uh but then if the if you're saying that [laughter]
uh
[laughter]
they should also regu- right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also regu- see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend
right
um-hum
[noise] how's the quality of air in portland
really
um-hum
um-hum probably a lot of ozone lot of smog
yeah it
oh yeah i've heard that los angeles is horrible and denver is [vocalized-noise] i hear is really bad
atlanta's atlanta's moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um
and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air
um
i think a lot i think m- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions
because you know it's a very you know mobile city
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
of heavy industry yeah i think i think the [vocalized-noise] has been you know relatively good about
um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about
in- industry pollution but it just seems that i th- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country
um it seems it seems like like there's a l- you know there's a l- there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know f- through through the c- through the construction of highways for automobiles
yeah
hm
i know a little bit of chemistry
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
until jus- g- the air it can't jus- it can't support them and the quality of life they want
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um they they do have automo- automobile emissions tests but um
it's there there's some sort of rule i don't have a car so i don't know the actual specifics but it's like if you- your car is if the ma- if the m- model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you don't have to have it inspected any more
you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that you'd expect to
you know be the hardest be the m- biggest polluters
yeah true
[laughter]
i basically live downtown
and i go to school at georgia tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or within a mile from the heart of downtown
it's i don't think it's really announced you know in the sense that the way i- the way it is in california but um
i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently there's some federal guidelines for um smog and atlanta's like it
[noise]
very good
uh well let me put it this way it's it's relatively uh it's very good i- if you are a little bit away from the city and it's and it's wonderful on days that it rains
but uh downtown they have a few problems but it's
but it's fairly localized it's not like uh los angeles where i used to live
ye- yes uh
it i guess that's the the major problem with most cities except except places like uh
oh mexico city or some place like that well i guess it's it's a problem there too but but they do have some places where that's caused by power plants and and stuff like that
yeah
although [vocalized-noise] there is one thing that i uh i learned in in
chemistry many years ago and that's uh i don't know are are you a chemist
okay anyway this is principle called le chatelier's principal as i remember and it's
basically uh
uh when you have uh
a reaction and it it uh [noise] the reaction will go until it un- until it kind of comes to a balance but if you take away some of the products of that reaction then the reaction will go farther
and so uh the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out was he said he said in a in a desirable area
people will move in until until bad things happen that cause the uh desirabilities to go to
you know to uh ba- kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be
it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what i'm looking at here in the portland area is is a temporary situation it's a very desirable area as far as i'm concerned and uh
the wonderful air the lack of of uh congestion the low low cost of of uh property uh
in a few years something's going to cause i mean there's uh people just going to continue to move in until we either
and a-
and as many people move in as move out
and it'll come to a balance and then if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion then air pollution will get bad or something else and that's happened in california that's for sure
uh as far as in atlanta do they have a uh do they have uh regulations on on uh like inspection
yeah the grandfather type thing
yeah
although i think that's partly because it's harder to get parts and and uh
so let's see what was my other question uh
[laughter] my wife thinks this is uh a uh sales call so she's telling me to talk to you about
one of the problems with uh she thinks it's fr- from uh our cable company
uh let's see what else we have uh
let's see do you live
you don't live too clo- do you live close to the city or far away from it
okay downtown
do they have smog days there
uh
[noise] okay eric um
are you married and do you have a family
okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
okay
um
[noise]
[noise] well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so
we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
and then we divvy them up between
our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
and so that does help that helps a lot
and then um we don't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending so it's pretty well [laughter] earmarked
yeah [laughter] ev- every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all
um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
[noise]
that's true
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
well it helps you to focus
where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s- the same frustration before you got on a budget but
you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
huh and also we have found that if we write down
a- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
every paycheck
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
[noise] just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's
we should because it does help
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
just stick to that uh-huh that is
uh-huh
yeah
that
that sounds like a really good idea
and it really helpful
um have you [noise] developed a savings plan or iras or anything like that yet
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's good that's a good feeling [noise]
my husband just graduated from the university uh [noise]
a year ago so finally [laughter] finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or
[noise]
[noise] uh yes i am to uh both questions
uh yeah we do we um [noise]
uh basically there's the you know expenses that
are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and
we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet
[noise] and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what
you know what sort of range we're gonna
generally gonna shoot for
[noise] so what do you do
um-hum
wow
yeah
yeah all allocated out [laughter] yeah
all the
checks yeah
right yeah we found that um
it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of
the unnecessary expenses [laughter] we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh
money for things that
you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh
thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
because of this and and stuff like that so
yeah [laughter]
that's a lot of money but [laughter]
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[noise]
yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if
you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a
in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount
and then once that was gone well [laughter] if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone [laughter]
so
we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so
[noise]
yeah i
um-hum
[laughter]
a study
yeah
yeah i'm actually in the in the mas-
[noise] i guess that starts it um
so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program
uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return
this time around on my uh investment
which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house
yeah what they do i- what they do is it's it's a purchase program
where you get the stock i- i- it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year
so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last may was five sixty four a share
stocks trading about fourteen now
so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty f- four and turn around the same day
the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do
yeah
that's with interleaf
interleaf
uh desktop publishing
so
but um you know
yeah benefits other than salary
[noise] um-hum
yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have [vocalized-noise] especially these days
right
what is what is that like a uh like a [noise] uh [vocalized-noise] tiacref type thing
okay yeah [vocalized-noise] so it's for retirement
yeah so you you have to wait until like [vocalized-noise] fifty five or
right
yeah we we we've got a 401k here
but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401k
but you know i'd much rather get the eight- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house
but yeah you know me- medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month
[noise] it's like your yeah it is it's a very good company as far as benefits go they've got 401k's they've got uh
the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125k selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the d- you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing
um and you know you the 125k means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax
the only problem with 125k is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away
so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears
but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and misce- miscellaneous medical and deductibles
so i just have them pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because it's on pre tax
yeah i'm here
yeah
yeah
yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know [noise] hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um
i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree
because then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did
[noise]
all right go
good
is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for
right
wow [noise]
yeah yeah that sounds good
what company is that
excuse me
interleaf never heard of it
oh okay
yeah what are we supposed to talk a- sa- [noise] benefits besides salary is that [vocalized-noise]
yeah but i- i get a i get a pretty good i work for the city of new york
and i get a pretty good um health plan
and
yeah the health plan's pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it
and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees
it's like a 401k plan except they don't they don't contribute
right
yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that
yeah uh
wow that's that's really good
right
if you own oh okay i see
right
hello
yeah it uh it was a width away that's why it's it's every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah there's there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's there's uh
there's benefits just in working for a big organization i think in in that you have a lot of uh different people doing a lot of different things and
okay
right well that's working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and and just that
um but what i mean is i- i say for instance i'm an attorney uh a collection attorney for the city of new york and and in the environmental control board and
i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff
[noise] music do you like
um-hum
um-hum
i'm more into rock and roll myself
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
do you like any bluegrass
[laughter]
oh well at least your
not really [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
um
we'll have to um
i have a lot of friends that like country music [laughter]
no i'm more into um older rock like psy- the psychedelic
era like uh
se- late sixties seventies um greatful dead crosby stills and nash
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh i've heard a little bit of it i've ju-
uh now i've heard of striper
it's li- the only one i can
um-hum
um-hum
um i've heard some amy grant before she was you know became more mainstream top forty
um-hum
um
i've never actually seen her in concert i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
um-hum
um-hum
um
i like some country music uh it's just that i like finding a lot of it's
yeah [laughter] mama got run over by the train [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
like garth brooks
reba mcintyre
hm
you don't like patsy cline
you don't like patsy cline
[laughter]
um yes actually i went to just went to just see the greatful dead about i guess about a week ago
no they're s- they're still on tour they've been touring since late sixties
no they're they're still together
they're still making albums
um-hum
uh
in fact i mean there are people that you know basically just follow them around from city to city on tour
selling tie dyes and things like that
um
yeah they're
they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
they seem to have you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in his thirties you know
uh
but uh
yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the rolling stones i just i- i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the rolling stones when they last toured but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric [laughter]
[laughter]
all their faces were just all shriveled and
um-hum
i mean it jus- just looked like you know they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
well uh
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just
uh just so that you know that
if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into la la land
um-hum
um-hum
so um have you seen any concerts lately
[noise]
um lots of different kinds i guess um
i like country music of course texas and i listen to christian music a lot because
there's a christian music station here in in our city so i listen to it quite a bit
so
um-hum and i listen because on friday nights they have the um
they have what they call saturday night live or they have it on saturday night friday night and saturday night and they have christian rock and roll
so you know they have that type of music but they just have different words
so i listen to that too
no not really hum-um
and i like i like rap music do you like rap music
not really [laughter] well i can tell we're we're together here [laughter] okay
[laughter] oh
[noise]
what kind of rock
[laughter] what kind of rock music do you listen to do you li- listen to like that really heavy metal stuff or
seventies [vocalized-noise] what the
uh-huh
yeah i have friends that like that
yeah [laughter]
so you've never heard of like the christian music that i listen to probably then
like have you heard of um
of carmen
have you ever heard of kim
striper they're the really heavy yeah like the heavy metal stuff i guess
yeah
yeah because she she plays both secular and christian so
yeah i like her too
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers and
she does she's real good she's real good
so i like her
[noise]
i don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me
yeah i don't like that
you know i like randy travis
you know i like more of the real new ones
you know garth brooks oh yes you know he's fine yeah i like them i don't care for the older you know like my dog left me stuff huh
no huh-uh i don't even really know who she is you know you know so
[noise] no
but have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like that music that you like to
but aren't they done with i thought that they
[noise]
[noise]
and i just thought that they done broke up and
left
hm
wow i didn't know that
hm
th- interesting
um-hum
[noise]
because they're on up there in age aren't they
[laughter] okay [laughter] all right [laughter]
oh all right
because they look pretty rough i mean i've seen like picture of them and they just
[laughter] yeah [laughter] i mean because they just
uh-huh yuck looking i mean ugh um
[noise]
um-hum well are you into that that
rock music you know all that druggie stuff and all that i mean
[laughter]
[laughter] you know what i'm saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you
they're not even know they're there you know they're just so out of it
yeah
so i ju- i just don't like you know
that so
[noise]
i don't know
[noise]
hm huh
[noise]
yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry
and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't
i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in
and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices consi-
i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um
nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time
i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh
if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that
but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh
uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle
[laughter] you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society
[vocalized-noise]
and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually ma- let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even
like not even on drugs
right
i did you see that thing on uh 60 minutes about the uh the air force pilot who um they there was a mistake at the lab
and oh it was on in 60 minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a b. fifty two bomber pilot
and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he
he uh he was drummed out of the air force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh
you know i guess it's called exonerated
but by then his career is was was ruined because
yeah
he's he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident
and
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah
oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors
uh [laughter] which you think of the
well no i'm talking about like the guy no i'm i'm talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i- i i wouldn't want
i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever [laughter] you know
[noise]
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know
i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random
law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on
[laughter] you know and [laughter] and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about [vocalized-noise] what should we be should we have legalized drugs
you know
[noise]
yeah i i think that uh
so uh
does your company do any sort of drug testing
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
so what are they worried about are they worried about
i mean do you is this a secure environment you're in
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about
um-hum
uh-huh
right and you'll be penalized
i mean you could lose your job very easily
no
okay
right
i guess so right
oh yes his life is over at that point
yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives
to the number of false positives and you know the number of people you're going to hurt
while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high
uh-huh
you [vocalized-noise] like the ticket takers
[vocalized-noise] engineer
[laughter]
it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for
you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball
and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing
not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something
that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before
and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's
you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick
or uh
you know uh using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck
and and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test
well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test
uh
the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job
uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle
uh
um-hum
[laughter]
well a lot of people say that that would
simplify a lot of things uh i tend to
i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops
[noise]
uh uh uh capital punishment i understand means if somebody commits a serious enough crime we kill them
is that your understanding of it
well let me put it bluntly [vocalized-noise] there's not too many things that arabs do right but one of the things they do is have a low crime rates they don't have too many repeat offenders
and they have uh very serious capital punishment over there
hum-um
hum-um hum-um
yeah
[vocalized-noise] yeah that sh- shouldn't happen but unfortunately it it can
uh i i'm in i think we're pretty much in agreement uh in texas this
death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess
yeah and then get out in what [laughter]
um
hm
he killed her
oh my gosh
well i was in the university of texas years ago when one guy killed two girls in his room and hid the bodies in the fiel-
and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out
[noise]
um-hum
what would you think about public executions
televised
hm
uh
[noise] if if it's death let's get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite qui- quite quickly they had this guy on the [vocalized-noise] news that's been around since seventy six and he's cost us over four million dollars so far
uh let's speed it up be sure it's as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldn't be out you shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days
uh tha- maybe off the subject but uh
[vocalized-noise]
oh yeah
um-hum
oh i'd i
i'd go with the ones on the street corner
[laughter]
no yeah start at the bottom start pushing the ones on the street corner they'll run out of supplies
i'm i'm cruel on that drugs have no place at all
um
um-hum
right
fairly quickly
fairly quickly i don't have uh you know [vocalized-noise] we're in so much agreement i guess i'm try to play the devil's advocate
uh
as a christian i can't even be the devil's adv- i'm a christian and i still think there's an appropriate place for it
uh
um um-hum
yeah i can go along with that i just wish we could get [vocalized-noise] get uh debate going here to get some verbal usage for the computer uh
i have a brother-in-law that is strictly opposed to it and uh he is a uh very liberal uh
believer in uh probation uh and convicts not being sent to prison but being sent to uh halfway houses
[noise] yeah
that's correct
right uh-huh
right
yes i i really think that um
there is room for that
i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and they're sentenced to life in prison then it's not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out
i believe that if they're convicted and it's um
you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence
to close the case do you know what i mean
right
well i don't think it's too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other
right and um then they're repeat offenders um i went to school with one of ted bundy's attacked girls
she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point
and i think he killed her definitely uh-hum
right um i think that in my belief i bel- we uh i believe that if a person has killed
then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can
i definitely no i don't think so i don't think that that's something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i don't agree with that and i don't even think that they need to
have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be
but i don't believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think
right
oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs
if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives
because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if i'm caught so what's the big deal
yep
no
and um
so i- i- i think that it could go even farther than
i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change
but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they re- repeat these offenses
so
[laughter]
yeah
that's
yeah i'm i'm a christian also and that's why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a person's committed murder that's an unpardonable sin
and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our lo- uh god is pardoning do you know what i mean
[laughter]
[noise] kids
are you are you married
are you
well um do you know what we're um to talk about is is families and stuff like that and um how how you
how you spend time with you're family and stuff uh i've got three kids
yeah so and i stay home with them so it's um
i spend a lot of time with my kids i really enjoy it i uh
i've uh i i was in college for you know four years and and worked for a number of years and and now we've got three preschoolers so i spend a lot of time with them and yeah
um i've got a six month old a uh two and a half almost three year old going on thirty and then a uh four and a half year old almost five year old so i've got a couple a couple of little ones but um
i i spend a lot of time with my kids um yeah it's
uh i i really am glad that that i'm able to stay home with them and stuff so it's real fun but well um do you uh
[noise]
hum oh okay well how would you spend time with your kids if you were if you had kids or or uh do you do you do any babysitting do you did you use to when you were in uh high school or anything
so what'd you do with them did you i mean of course you were paid to uh to spend time with them and stuff but what did you do to uh entertain them and keep them entertained were they older kids or school age
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah we my kids well my kids are
of course now that it's getting warmer much more outdoors than than indoors but
shoot they can sit and work puzzles and read books for a long time so that's kind of and they did they pretty much they entertain themselves when i need them to but
i spend a lot of time i spend a lot of time with them reading and we play games and stuff but
yeah but it's it's it's neat cause they're really they're they're well behaved kids and they're and they
they interact pretty well with adults they're shy at times but they interact pretty well with adults and
uh i have my oldest goes to preschool two days a week and my my little girl goes one day one of the same days so um
yeah and then my little boy will start kindergarten next year so we went and checked out the school [vocalized-noise] la- last week in fact they had an open house and stuff so
yeah that's an adventure i think it's gonna be harder on mom than it's [laughter] than it is on him but yeah it's like oh i can't send my baby to school [laughter] it's just yeah it's like i can't believe i you know he's
he's he'll be five in in july and it's just hard to believe that you know time has has flown by so quick so yeah
so i don't know it's it's
they're pretty fun they're they're good kids so yeah well uh what are you majoring in in college
in physics
well you won't you won't deal much with kids in that area [laughter]
no
[laughter]
oh i know it seems like forever and i think uh i i don't know my husband you know wants to go back for um some uh master degree and stuff and i just think
oh i just not into that right now maybe in a couple of years i you know i might want to do that but it's i don't know i i was glad to have gotten out so
yeah that was uh i enjoyed my time but you know met my husband and met him there so it was uh
a a nice nice sideline of it so that was good but uh
well what else about kids how do you think people spend time with their kids do you have any idea
kind of different huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
we go we went to the zoo saturday as a matter of fact yeah it's an adventure with three kids i mean it's it's fun but you i mean with three of them
two's pretty ea-
[noise]
uh no i don't i don't
no no i'm in i'm in college i'm just a sophomore in college
oh okay
uh-huh
[noise]
have you
[laughter]
that's great
um-hum
oh that's grea- how old are they
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
that's great
yeah that must be nice
[laughter]
oh yes i baby sat all the time for uh for my last year in high school my full time job was going over to a a neighbor's house and babysitting their children until they got home every day and uh
right
[noise]

they were seven and nine years old both boys so we played we we did stuff like play softball and frisbee and that kind of thing and
sort i sort of watched them you know ride their bikes and
that kind of thing
they were outdoorsy types
right
right right
well that's nice
well that's good
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
none of them have started school yet
oh really
[laughter]
really
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh yeah
well that's
that's great
i'm i'm in physics

oh no [laughter] i don't think i'll be out of school for a long long time [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh yeah i will be too
yeah yeah
yeah
um not really my uh my parents are divorced and my father uh is dating a woman who has a two year old boy and uh
yeah it is real different but they go they just went to disney world he was in florida so they just went to disney world this weekend and they they do some fun stuff together go to the zoo and that kind of thing
really
i bet
[noise] hello ann
um the other day
i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling
and uh
i was kind of interested to hear because they had some people from the e._p._a. and lots of different places
and uh
they
had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
[laughter] well it's not too new
oh
they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were
the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e._p._a.
but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and
things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and
and uh
uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um
the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print
and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into [noise] recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
yeah we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here there's uh
we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a
couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper
and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not
a fire hazard and make it into insulation
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to
get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it
um-hum
and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was
oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was
how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill
and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics
and it was really quite amazing because he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's
it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever
well that was [laughter] he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it
yeah well real interest-
[noise] um
not too much i'm
uh i got a bit actuall-
[noise] hello chuck
um-hum
um-hum
um i didn't think that was a new revelation
right
so what what i- is the e._p._a. recommending now
um-hum
yeah
why that's a that's a common problem now that seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york [noise]
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore
which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose
um-hum
right
well that's good
right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that [noise] uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers
uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh
i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled
[noise] like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that
um-hum
[noise] oh really
right
huh
well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but [noise] what
what about emissions
oh
okay
no well that's interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then
did it change anything for you
[noise]
um-hum
does he he live at home now and
um-hum yeah
no i i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady she's uh she's really pretty good but but she really just can't get around any more and she does have signi- significant health problems
and my mom is looking after after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out
uh and uh it's tough on on my grandmother because she's use to just
going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing
fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah
yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little bit more objective but
i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy
yeah
yeah
um
yeah
you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums
where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence
but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile
the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost
uh i mean that's that's almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but it's it's
[vocalized-noise] you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets
so they want to really make a a a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she'd be happier
uh and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating
and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you
oh
um-hum yeah
oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or ha-
oh
oh yeah
oh
yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and there's [noise] the- there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of of house mates
somebody that comes and lives there and for the room and board takes care of people but
you need you need a contact service in the community i'd i'd even be happy just
uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting so- right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she
uh no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father
and it is a tough decision to make [laughter]
that uh
yes and he's living at home [noise] more or less alone my sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden on her
and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do
and of course he feels like he is capable of taking care of himself and we know better [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh yeah yeah
well that's that will be a problem because i have looked [laughter] and they all really amount to the same thing uh
i've looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of state run things to the very private elite type and it really
boils down i think to one thing you're putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die
and it's uh it's sad but that's the way we've been brought up to look at it
and i hate it but there comes a time when when this is what what happens
especially with the way medicine is today it's keeping us alive longer and
we're living longer so therefore you know
right
yeah it's kind of our
right
uh-huh
the cost is just unreal [laughter]
right well that's
uh-huh
right right
well it is especially since he lives in mississippi i live in texas and my sister lives in louisiana [laughter] this this you know it makes fact i just got back from having to go stay with him because she needed to get away
and it's uh
but uh i don't know what other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place
well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that really is what bothers us uh he could start a fire just about anything [laughter] could happen
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
right
right
[noise] oh i guess i started it
bust away
oh um new york
yeah
uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
yeah well
yeah i know i pay too much
yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um
the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just propor- i'm i'm viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage
and on the bad years i'm not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i don't pay below average
yeah yeah i'm a consultant
you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back
there was that went away a few years ago
and uh
you know whatev- you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed
[laughter] but uh i don't know for sure
um
well i didn't say value um i'm just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount
uh no not at the moment not at present
um
yeah yeah yeah
well that's
yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't
make it desirable
yeah
yeah yeah well unless you're up in the uh mega bucks range
[laughter]
[laughter] but um
yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar
i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh washington d._c. awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something
you know
so uh you know what's going in -s got to be a lot more -an going out if it can pay for all that stuff
well i'm not really talking about um
who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things
in the middle
yeah that's what i meant
[vocalized-noise]
what's that
well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up ano- billion
and uh
business as usual
i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean
yeah
right
um-hum
well that's the theory um
um-hum
yeah
yeah well they play that game here in new york but um it worki- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities
i'm sorry on- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can rec- uh concentrated then it is taxed
so um i don't claim to understand that [laughter]
you know that's um
and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and
hope people -ill stop
yeah but you know we
liquor yeah thing is you know you got to l- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people [laughter]
hm
hm
right
really
yeah
you know i um we get a tax here
that um
what do you call it uh
[noise]
oh okay
so uh where you from just in general
state
new york okay i'm in new jersey
okay so uh i guess we're talk about taxes uh so what do you
you pay too much
um-hum
oh are you like a small business or something or
oh okay
isn't it their like [vocalized-noise] um income averaging or something like that
oh okay [laughter]
oh
huh
so why why do you think you don't get uh anything enough for your value i mean
oh you a single
um-hum
uh i know singles pay more than married people
and i'm single i know that and i pay quite a bit higher than a married person
where if you don't happen to buy a house or something like that
and you don't uh
yeah that's about the only uh tax uh write off you can get these days
well yeah buy a yacht or some-
but i guess they took away that and they're yelling and screaming about that
um-hum yeah
well it depends if it's you know a a regressive tax or a progressive tax
well no yeah
borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time it's like
yeah
i don't know i- i
uh i don- know uh here in new jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think it's uh regressive tax it's just as worse
progressive um i- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive
you know and so the i- idea behind that is to to you know that's why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least suppose-
you know that's what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat f- percentage tax um across the board
and e- and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and a-
uh-huh
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
yeah sin taxes
you don't need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live
well it's to a degree if uh you know if you're addicted it's not going to matter but
um certainly it it depends i mean here you in new jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities
so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water [laughter] it's crazy um you know you you see what you it's got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utility's thir- thirteen percent
-ay i guess we're talking about exercise huh
oh i am twenty seven
[laughter]
you do what type of exercise do you do
oh you do
yes
is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing
and you do that every day
oh okay
oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a a group
do you go with friends or do you go alone
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
oh
oh yeah [laughter] young mothers or yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and that's what i do everyday
yeah pretty much when my wife let's me
no i just shoot around by myself
and uh that's about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce [laughter]
uh-huh
you do exercises
you do ex-
uh-huh
yeah and i
well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but
i don't know [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way
uh basketball volleyball um
just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that
um i used to but it got too expensive so
yeah
yeah a lot of people do that
and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things
oh they come up here
that's in nevada uh-huh
oh yeah but
there's snow bird or alta
heavenly
huh i've never heard of that one huh-uh
[laughter]
do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but
oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after
yeah
my legs really really ache
but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before
[laughter]
[noise]
okay
yeah yeah well first of all i i ha- have to ask you how how old you are
twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are [laughter] but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis
well i do um jazzercise which is an aerobic um
program that are you familiar with it
it's uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in plano that has classes like all day long so you can
no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
no i only do it [noise] probably two or three times a week
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week
well it's really a
i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can
so like i usually choose to go like at nine thirty in the morning or or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
no i go by myself an- and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise [vocalized-noise] or they might play tennis
and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
you know with with children between the ages
young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do
oh great
yeah so you play everyday
well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just
you know
yeah
well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat
you know but you'll come b- being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will
well it might not [laughter] it might n- because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i
i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball
but do you ski being in utah i was wondering if you skied
oh did it really
because i know that skiing in utah is is suppose to be great
yeah
yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it tahoe where you ski from
no that's nevada to california i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
but there's a funn- there is a place in utah called a funny name
but it's like oh heavenly is that it
yeah i think it's called heavenly
you've never heard of that
well maybe it isn't in utah i don't know
but they said they've skied heavenly and [laughter] it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny
oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i c- mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
and
and then is it you- your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and
yeah
yeah
well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding
and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over
[noise]
uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here
and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will
have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for
[noise]
[noise]
that's amusing [laughter] yeah
yeah i think we have a similar thing in california and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and
and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge
[noise]
yeah
yeah
the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but
it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way
we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place
because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical
instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance
i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are
[laughter]
yeah
well that's pretty good
[laughter]
that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives
i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research
so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh
physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits
and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that
um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort
hm
yeah
that's true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits
uh even though you could you might never have any need for them uh here in georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy
must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesn't matter that you're single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears
and uh [laughter] it's that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me
uh drug treat- yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're
even if you're a mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you know
uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh
uh if y- if you have a a full gamut of
of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company [vocalized-noise] is wi- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra- prefer to do is say
don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something
right
um-hum
yeah i think that uh a a lot of them are that way they uh th-
they dea- they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary carrer and who's the secondary carrier but um
uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at hayes uh
the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month
it is i'm very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um
there's a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that
um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know g- work further on a degree or or get a master's degree of something uh uh course
um-hum
um-hum
yeah we don't have that either
uh in in some ways i think it's it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and
and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody ex-
[noise]
um-hum
[noise] well here in saskatoon um [noise] much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh
[noise] any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people [noise] uh [noise] there are areas where we could uh [noise] actually we have a couple of the uh
handicapped societies type of places where they uh [noise]
one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we're able to uh [noise]
have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are
there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so we're able to uh [noise] take it to one of the uh [noise]
rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers [vocalized-noise] they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then
right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing
[noise] and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have
o- one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum [noise] cans as well
[noise] and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so [noise]
uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
well actually there's
there's the opportunity for both
[noise] generally the uh
the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
[noise] and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
and then i have a then then they in turn will get [noise] some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well [noise]
um yeah [noise] um i guess partly because of our climate here in saskatoon at least the majority of
central c- uh well i want to say central canada but central canada tends to be referred more to ontario and quebec
[noise]
but um
we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfor welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing [noise] um
there's psychological pressure against
employing people to do that kind of thing although um
scouts and
hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
[noise] they have done it some
um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers they're actually at
virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries
collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
um some of the
[noise] hey steve um they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think actually this is my first experience with recycling program but um instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about
um i'm starting to split stu- sp- split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there
but the deposits only on like drink stuff
okay
okay
oh okay
so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money
or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you
oh okay
that's very cool you know there's a i i heard about a a similar program in new york city where uh i think it's called like homeless incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people
to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one
lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and and get more money to these people that desperately need it
[laughter] yeah
do they do it with newspapers as well
hm
[noise]
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale
uh-huh
right very definitely
uh-huh
well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old they aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out my mamma is a dialysis patient
and she is only about sixty four but she's had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person
and doesn't like having having people
uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
uh
i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home
and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety
i think right on ninety right now
and he's living by himself my grand mamma died a couple of years ago
so but he's you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people i'd like to see them stay at home
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
right especially for your uncle i bet
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer do they have anything like that in dallas
right so they are pretty limited
oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology
well had a job for a while where she went around to
to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives
to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities
i don't think that was mainly with alzheimer's patients but just patients in [vocalized-noise] people in general who were not as independent as they use to be
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
to need uh get there and to participate in the activities
right
right
that's true you can't play those things
but you can sing songs and uh
tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about you're was it your grand mother
that was having alzheimer
uh being able to tell old stories you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way
do they like to listen to other people recollect though
[noise]
right
well that is good because we
[noise]
well i think um the elderly is a really neat population to care for
they've got a lot of special needs
and at the same time
um
majority of them don't want to give up
the independence that they have
[noise]
and so you've got a real balance to make there
what about you
um-hum
uh-huh
[noise]
[laughter]
oh really
oh okay
yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties
and she's uh suffering from a low uh well uh progressive alzheimer's disease
so she doesn't remember anybody
and
uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young
and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
and it's creating a lot of problems
oh yes yes
in dallas um yeah i've he- i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them
but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there [vocalized-noise] for the day program and pick them up
right
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well it's it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the peop- if the people are able
and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active
and their body just hasn't kept up with them
and i think that's in a way somewhere some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
right
cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work
and sports
but if your vision is gone
and you have arthritis real badly
yeah you can't do it
well that's true
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory
my grandmother doesn't [laughter] she wou- she wants to te- to tell you about her story over again so
which is fine you know so
[noise]
um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is
uh put the data into quicken i don't know if you're familiar with that
um-hum
hm
i i've found that it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what -ill happen is my wife or i'll write a few checks and then we'll uh
uh
not bother to total it
and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it [vocalized-noise] helps with that
um
uh actually we haven't had to y- y- uh uh until just recently i guess we've got a
a daughter who's eighteen months and another one on the way so
we need to start doing more of that just for uh
you know saving for college and things like that
we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for
um
um-hum
hm
hm
sounds good
yeah i guess we're we're just at the point m- uh
my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's lot more interesting trying to
find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to
um
do it just you know kind of enforce the savings
but uh it'll be interesting to see
[vocalized-noise]
hm
um
that sounds good
but uh
uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
oh
okay
um cincinnati actually
i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people
are uh going to be involved in this but
uh
well that's interesting i'm uh
[vocalized-noise]
uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading telecom digest or was there another
oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh
um-hum
yeah it'll be interesting to see what they [vocalized-noise]
it'd be interesting to see how the data base [vocalized-noise] well i guess we're talking about the experiment and
probably try to get back on the
topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without
getting to uh dollar figures i guess
you know we could talk about some of the long range goals
yeah
um
well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
uh
i guess we'll have to
factor that in if we- if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement
i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh
now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's it's a real shift from what we had before uh because we're
[noise]
yeah i've uh have some friends of mine who use quicken and uh
i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now
um-hum
yeah well i
have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we
try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we'll get behind like you say but uh
it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we r- just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances
um-hum
yeah well that's pretty good if you can do that i know
i have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but um
we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so
we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be
putting away for her college fund
um-hum
um-hum
well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently
uh
took on a full time job well almost full time
so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and
significant travel and that kind of thing
ah wisconsin
how about you
um-hum
uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over
um
the computer network called internet
and he just forwarded that on to me and
um
it sounded like it'd be an interesting project to participate in so i
sent
sent back some e-mail
um-hum
um-hum
what other long range goals do you have besides college
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] anyway uh [noise]
what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos [laughter] um
right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh
it's called living within your means [laughter]
you know which means at the moment um paying off the visa bill and keeping everything else under control
and hoping the car doesn't collapse [laughter]
um but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment um
but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i don't [noise] usually don't exceed that unless i unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that
that then it goes through the moon so
yeah so um
what'd you
so you can afford to get a house
[laughter]
[noise] yes
yeah
so what do you and your husband do
are you really
hm
no kidding
i see so overseas where would you be going
really
really how long would you be there
with with what church
oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in costa mesa as i recall
th- there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was [vocalized-noise] so um are you uh are you uh active in translation
um-hum
true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides english of course
um-hum
[noise]
in france
[laughter]
um
must have been terrible
the um
was it henry macon said that the
the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die
and i it it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that free style english is just
takes on n-
[noise]
how about you what do you do with your budget
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah that's true
yeah that sort of a problem
we're trying we're trying
to um
so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is
so
not much on that side of it [laughter] to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings
and stuff like that but
yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
but we don't know how long it will be a dream
we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um
economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh
and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
so
africa nigeria
yeah
about four years we're career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year
um we're with wycliffe bible translators
so
yeah they could very well and
um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh
came home and got married and we will go ba- back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family
as translators well i always wanted to do translation
but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
and how to do market stuff but in about
um about five i guess i can do better in it and my french is pretty good but it's uh senegalese french so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um
in france yeah because they're real snobby about their language and senegalese french is street french and
i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
said something here when i came home and french to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
since then i have refrained from speaking any french [laughter] except in senegal [laughter]
i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
[noise]
that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here
at one point i'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to boise idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me
um-hum
um-hum
i agree with that uh i found though that
that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule
and i can't remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week
so the uh it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason
no one raises an eyebrow but because of that i'm not a clock watcher [noise] if i if i knew they were expecting me there
at eight thirty every day and i couldn't leave until five i- i think i'd be uh
uh have a greater tendency to wait until the clock hit five and then say i- out of here
right
yeah that's correct that's correct
[laughter]
right
[laughter]
another [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
wow [laughter]
um-hum
right
[vocalized-noise]
uh the company i'm working for now starts everyone out at three weeks vacation
and i- i thought that was great except during the first year i ended up only being able to take about a week and a half of it [laughter]
right i was i was so busy uh
and it we've got a very small department and i was just uh wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take time off and when i
did take the time off i'd uh get calls from work anyway
so it's only been uh in th-
[noise] okay well
lets see i i guess i'll i'll mention it i always one of the things i always considered was real important about job benefits i always uh [vocalized-noise] i know they can't do anything about it but i always thought location and quality of life in the region was important towards
a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is
i- in my job an- an- an- besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work
but see those are the things that they can't really do much about [laughter]
um-hum
yeah the uh [vocalized-noise] i was uh
i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer client climate uh so
uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt uh
i've worked in uh san diego and i've worked in atlanta so you can see that i've moved
moved father south since then [laughter] uh i used to live in ohio when i when i was going to school
and uh it's still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh baltimore and uh boston
and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity
always used to bother me because i really never got into the winter sports
but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me
uh other job benefited jo- job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible
uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you can't do too much and i understand that
you're out of there yeah [laughter] you then you then you punch in a clock and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say well you know why should i give them anymore
but what they [vocalized-noise] uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i- i- i take it then that you are also a professional
[laughter] a salaried employee [laughter]
[laughter] uh it
usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i- i- i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up the hours and
i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour
oops [laughter] bu- uh well let's see what other i i've always liked i've always liked some vacation i i've i've been fortunate i actually had a
uh the com- i just just transferred jobs about a week ago [laughter]
[laughter] so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation
now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility
uh but of course now i've gone to zero amount of years in the company so now i'm back to the
to the uh original two weeks [laughter] that was a tough benefit to give up
yeah that is a good benefit
right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done
[noise] so it says how do you keep up on news um i suppose i had longer to think about it so i'll just uh answer the question i
i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost effect- or time effective way to do it because on t._v. you have to t- put up with all the happy talk and the commercials
and um then on uh like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record na- all things considered from national public radio
and i- i when i ride the bike m- ride my bike to campus i i have it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
and how about you
um-hum
um-hum
hm
all the all the aids cases in miami for example
yeah that's right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh
most of the time s- tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not not not them alone but
most of the news media but probably they more more uh strongly than a lot of the others
have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know ju- just don't report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news
hm i don't know but i think that for example after the uh
after the uh iran iraq war when uh oil oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i'm sure they did you just didn't hear about it
so um i- i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there's no other game in town except for monitor which is y- you know about um about the christian science monitor program
uh
no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program
but that's
i'm sorry
right yeah that it i- i don't think they well i mean i know they don't broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i'm in another part of the country so
uh you know i mean they're they're really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that's
that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the mcneil leh- lehrer news hour but that's on t._v. and then you've got to be sitting there
yeah
um-hum
yeah well at least it's not the same slant is is all things considered huh
so that's that's true yeah bu- now i like the wall street journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or u._s._a. today but um
they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one
um-hum
right
i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don't know how i acquired a wall street journal it just happened uh last month there was a story on recycling uh i think actually that was a column one story though
but uh that talked about the way that uh some communities are trying to recycle so much that they don't have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one locality i think it was portland ended up burning
the stuff some of it some of it because there's nothing else they could do with it
yeah
so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just
that was the only thing but it was it was good uh discussion of the markets for various recycled products
[noise]
right
[laughter]
okay
yeah
right
uh-huh
oh okay
uh that's interesting i- i've never heard of the news letters angle i'm also an all things considered person weekend edition whatever
uh i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things i'd just had soon not hear for about two minutes
yeah
yeah exactly
yeah although i think that's probably uh true of most news coverage in general good news isn't news right
right
uh yeah on television or radio
yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they they broadcast that i think between five a._m. and six a._m. which is a a little before i get up so i usually miss it
right
yeah like like you i of- i rarely spend time watching news on t._v. the uh
i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn't usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like mcneil lehrer so
for me it's pretty much a diet of uh
all things considered and i like to look at the wall street journal at work which uh i think does a fine job it too has a slant but uh
yeah exactly and
yeah i think uh what is it the fourth column of page one is uh kind of famous in it's own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i me-
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[laughter]
right back to square one
yeah and that's that's the kind of thing the journal does best i find i don't have time to read through the whole thing certainly but i find if you ju-
[noise]
uh
well i mean in d._c. there's a law uh that was recently passed that like um
you have to [noise] it's a law i think that organizations
have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle it's a law to do it
right
[laughter]
it's like um mean personally i've never been a recycling nut terms of like i don't i don't go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me
um [noise] more apt to do it because it's there it's more convenient
right
right
yeah i mean i'm looking right here there's a waste bin [vocalized-noise] for waste i don't know i guess they recyc- i guess they can recycle
normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin i'll put something in there if it fits [noise] they've got cans and bottles um and bins for paper
no
no not really i mean
yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um
as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably
i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm pro- i'm if it was there i'd use it
yeah
exactly i mean even in my in my dorm it's in the basement but i pile it i let i let them pile up in the tr- in my uh in the gar- in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can
um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it
i mean if it's there they're going to do it still i mean some people won't even go that far out of their way
[noise] there are people who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways
yeah
yeah
yeah i'm sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green
type of thing
green thinking should call it
[noise] people more aware
more aware they need to save the environment and all that
right
oh definitely i mean there's been plenty of uh up roar about the uh marriott using um styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing
yeah
cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have a plastic coated and they're probably even worse i don't really know
harder to recycle
yeah
well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive
[noise] um
they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious
and they i believe they give discounts o- on drinks if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive
you have a discount on your on your on your drink instead of the regular price or whatever
yeah
[laughter] right
[laughter]
[noise]
so well what what are you guys doing with recycling
yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh incinerator actually only two thirds of the county built it
and they also of course they had to the new york state e._e._c. the environmental people mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued
[laughter] has to uh recycle
yeah a lot of people up here the exact same way you know they won't lift a finger
and uh it hasn't gotten around here that you know you go to any store or something and there is a trash can there isn't a bin for glass a bin for
it's it's really just on the ver- i- it hasn't quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh
uh utah had some bins
[vocalized-noise]
so you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it
[noise]
toss it in the first place that it [vocalized-noise] that you could find
right well i think well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available
yeah
yeah i guess you know my mom she always recycled everything
so i'm use to it but
if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn
so maybe you know the next generation -ill be a little bit more uh conscientious than we are
course you are on a college campus where people are more aware than the general public
[laughter]
n- now that's really tough because you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic
y- who knows what's not
and uh you know if you put them in a landfill they take up the same amount of space
because the paper doesn't break down either
[laughter]
well that that's good i mean god forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it
yeah like [laughter]
imagine that [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise] -ay
um
so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home
hm
um-hum
that's true yeah
hm
um-hum
that's true i never thought of that yeah
that's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with
yes they really are they don't like to keep them longer than a week
yeah
what do you mean
yeah that's true
yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own [noise]
yeah um [noise] i would personally like it if my parents
were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible
but um
to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible [noise]
right
um-hum [noise] yeah
that's true yeah [noise]
but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out
ahead of time
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] yeah that they're
yeah
right
an- know what they're doing with that
yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it [noise]
and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet
but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her
and being a burden she's very independent
so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country
and um she really enjoys it right now
[noise] because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook
uh-huh
right some support and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
and
what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
and then so if she ever does become ill
um it'll be like family around her
yeah
um-hum
yeah sh-
um-hum
no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels
and um it's in in missouri in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh [noise] i- i hope that i have something like that
when i get older
um-hum
oh definitely it's
um-hum
right
[noise] okay
well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh
uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh [noise]
in and who around
so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home
um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness
sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to
but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam- well the families do not necessarily
uh know what to do with them and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home
so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think
yeah
that's true
well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because there it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
[noise] so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either medicare or insurance to cover it
so
yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh
[noise] i know some el- unfortunately some elderly have to go to or [noise] have
i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wander or or um
confused or have some mental problems
and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
um-hum
gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active
so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place [noise]
yeah i think i think of the um
i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in
and the family that's going to be uh effec- effected by it [noise]
[noise] and uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're
[noise] uh guy uh some of my things i i'd like to have a short work week
you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau-
ye-
okay
[noise] okay [noise] so i just press one then right okay ready
okay
[noise]
well right now i'm i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force before and
forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it it seems like s-
saturday you you get off but sunday you're getting ready for monday
and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job
and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh
more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have le- we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd nee- you know less police force
it it that's that's that's a that's a possibility one o- one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance
is that the small businesses can't a- can't offer us health insurance
and it it it's too costly and then what i- what is happening is that they're on um
a policy where they have s- x. amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and
and and things like that
what happen- and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group well what'll what happens then is that
they cancel because they just can't cancel the indivigal
so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job i'm i'm an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i'm
i'm not a typical student i'm i'm older i'm i'm in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and
my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
it's a really really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
one of the things that i- i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know wanna
yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i- i just really can't deal with that so
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
uh-huh
yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know whe- when you work at a company
whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist
but if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so
that's where i'm tha- i'm i like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in in any o- one of these jobs and anything i've done
is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway
but what i
[vocalized-noise]
oh okay
okay we can start off there let's just get started i don't wanna we- you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it [laughter]
right
yep
so so you think uh i- i think [vocalized-noise] a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about you
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] uh-huh
right
yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that
yeah
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
so
right
yeah
right
[laughter]
yeah uh
well i do wor- uh research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so
uh
i my job has most of the benefits i want um
what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like but uh
you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh
they pay for continuing education like i- i get night courses that they're they'll cover right now and that's really good
yeah
right
yeah
right
[noise] okay
[laughter] lately they haven't been much but as a child i used to
go camping a lot with my my parents we would uh we lived in mississippi then and we'd go out and camp for the weekend and fish an-
but we camped like in tents not in uh [laughter] the mobile home or the
right [laughter] that's what i consider really camping [laughter]
uh-huh
got familiar with that lake [laughter]
uh-huh
they are uh-huh
oh that's neat [noise]
yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh
my husband races cars
and in fact we come to atlanta for about ten days every year and and that's part of my camping experience is we camp out there a little bit sleep in our van or [laughter] what have you for a few nights and um
kind of cook out of it and what have you but
oh sounds nice
um-hum
yeah well well whenever i mention camping anymore to my husband he says i'm too old for this [laughter] he says i- i like my luxuries anymore but i think i'd still like to you know do a little camping that
like i say i it brings back memories of my real young years and uh
he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping anyway true camping
i bet
uh-huh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you can't really depend on your weather [laughter]
um-hum
and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then we've been coming about a week or so too early [laughter] but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping
[laughter]
have they oh well that is really nice
well i'm sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get take time to
go out and enjoy them um
in the spring when the bluebonnets
are pretty here i think that's our biggest deal there's just fields of bluebonnets and
what we call indian paint brushes it's it's really nice
mostly nothing
[noise] so uh what are your camping experiences like
uh-huh
oh yeah you roughed it [laughter]
ba-
yeah i the only really camping experiences uh i've had i guess was probably with the cub scouts or the boy scouts when uh i was younger uh we use- i remember one time we went to uh
uh there's a lake called lake lanier here in georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of
yeah we s- we set up all our you know we we canoed out to some island and uh that was a lot of fun set up because we were all we were isolated from everyone else but um
that's pretty much
i haven't been [vocalized-noise] lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh
uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones
so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to alabama somewhere like in a
northern alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some r- ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and
climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day affair it's not a overnighter type thing but i'd like to i'd like to really get into that kind of thing
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
the last the last true camping experience i had is when uh
i drove across country with a friend of mine he li- he goes to school out in california and we drove his car out there and uh we drove you know we took kind of a scenic route we went through uh
uh the grand canyon and
and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it go- it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
was just small enough so that it didn't act- cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the [laughter] for uh
you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and
got in the car and uh drove on we were on a kind of a sch- tight schedule anyway so we couldn't stay too long but we drove on that morning to uh las vegas so [laughter] i think that was probably my last uh
true camping experience
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
well this time of year [vocalized-noise] it's gets really beautiful down the springtime in georgia with all the dogwoods and
there's all kinds of
it's rea- north there's really some real beautiful spots to to hike and stuff in north georgia you know up in the kind of getting up the mountainous
you know the the
yeah it sure is
that's true like today it's it's pouring it it takes the leaves around here i mean it's beautiful when they uh when they change it it seems like it happens so fast that if you don't get there at the right time you're gonna miss everything
yeah
they're getting
they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom
um-hum
that'd be nice
i haven't been through that part of the country so i don't really know what i don't really know what it's like over there
live in new york and capital punishment is illegal in this state and uh
it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment uh and
i feel that it's barbaric actually it seems out of date with civilization as
i think so because i think what we're talking about is is uh life making and life taking decisions and i i don't think any
one human being has the right to take away the life of any other human being not that it's a a religious feeling or anything like that
but it seems hypocritical to me that we'd say in the case of murder for instance that
uh because you took away somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong we are going to take away your life i don't see that that makes any sense really
i don't think it's a matter of the of the murderer's rights i think it's a matter of our uh
penal people's rights and i don't think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment uh to deter other people from
doing such heinous crimes uh for instance i think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody who commits any murder of any sort
and i also think that uh other things that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as putting prisoners to work and making them earn their their pay
but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative
to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're
uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldn't change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i don't see it as much of a deterrent either
yeah and i think that's unfortunate that is probably the way it is today and i think that ought to be changed uh
i think like i said i think people ought to be made to pay for their stay and not make it pleasant for them i think hard labor should be required even among people that a- a- are not able
to perform hard labor you know if th- if they died naturally from working then i guess that would be okay because that wouldn't be uh putting anybody to death forcibly
but uh i i can't see i can't see executing people it just seems so barbar- barbaric in these times
in california i i thought there was but i could be wrong
what amazes me is how many people speak out in favor of capital punishment even here in new york
people really want to see it uh be put into effect it seems more so than those of us who feel the way i feel uh uh at least are vocal
saying that no they want things to stay the way they are lot of people want to see capital punishment made legal
okay um
i guess uh i guess we did what we have to do and i don't see any instructions as far as doing anything else so i uh it's nice talking with you
okay take care bye
[noise]
[noise]
really even if the the crime is extremely extremely serious
well it's not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals
so if some person just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people
does he really have the right to [vocalized-noise] continue living and be a burden on society
yeah i agree with that part yeah def-
well some criminals would see it a- a life in jail doesn't particularly sound too harsh to someone who's been living on the street you know for all his life and then
uh jail jail time would seem like uh you know a break or a a paid
paid sustenance for the rest of his life
yeah
make it make it harsh as possible
yeah
uh well i live in california i'm not really up on it i
i think we don't have capital punishment either
huh-uh
yeah
well
yeah i'm one of those guys [laughter]
okay
you too you too bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
um i'm i'm a co-op student at g._t._r._i.
uh i go to school at georgia tech and we don't have benefits to speak of we don't have health insurance or paid vacation and
um-hum
undergrad
um-hum
oh
yeah yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's a good idea i had never thought about it that way
um-hum
yeah
right
right that's
that would be a wonderful idea
uh-huh
um
righ-
uh-huh
um-hum
i didn't know that
really
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
wow
[noise]
yipes
um-hum
right
oh i'm i'm just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh i'm not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and uh
i haven't gotten them yet i'm going in a few
um
and i- i
i'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh
if research for a school would be something i would consider
oh oh it's the georgia tech research institute it's affiliated with the university um
and uh we do research uh the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas
and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government
so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government
so
[noise] right now i'm at um
university of pennsylvania i'm a graduate student
and the benefits that i get are very minimal
but i do get my health insurance paid for but i don't have any kind of disability insurance or um
let's see no disability insurance no va- well i ge- in a way i get vacation pay because i get to se- totally set my own schedule
but
not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal
uh-huh
you're undergraduate student or graduate student
undergrad yeah
yeah here they for the grad students at least
in physiology department which my de- degree granting department is bio- engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesn't even do that
but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now
so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had
everybody responsible for their own health insurance
and either that or wh-
they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income
so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else
so
i guess
i would like to see something like that and then
i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having
instead of um a national health insurance system having
a sort of like an f._d._i._c. for health insurers so if if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick
but on the other hand i- in the curr- state of the current system i'll
whenever i get out of here i'll look for
a job probably an academic job that would
you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get t._i._a._a. for your retirement plan
which is a it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to
and
a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking [noise] good care of you
i know my daddy worked for the federal government
and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he w- taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the
federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isn't particularly well
she has um she's a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that
now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture
and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month [laughter]
so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get
what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out
um-hum
uh-huh
[noise] hum
what kind of company are you working with co-oping
i see
uh-huh
right
um
so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
uh-huh
uh-huh
i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
um-hum
um-hum
um
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh the the only prob- the only problem i see with term limitations um
is that i think that
the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve
and that you know you can't just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective
uh congress person
uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
uh-huh
yeah but
uh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh the other the other thing that that
uh bothers me about our system is just that um
in for for
in in in congress the amount of power any any particular congress critter has
is based on their seniority and how long they've been there so it's you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well
we're going to just we're [vocalized-noise] i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
uh-huh
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh
yeah
uh-huh
well i mean [vocalized-noise] i don't see why it makes a big difference the c._i._a. because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh
um-hum
[noise]
generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean
i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too
i know some senators and i don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and
i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year
which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less
you know less than i do [laughter]
i think i think that's true however i think that's always been true
i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover every eight years or four years
and uh they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short
i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a congressman
uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for congress senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't you we aren't having a massive ballot every four years
uh-huh i think i think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the c. i a. is moving out to west virginia which is a really stupid location for
a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isn't in west virginia i hate to tell the s- the senator from west virginia this information but
it really doesn't [vocalized-noise] uh the world does not revolve around west virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around d. c. you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and
the c. i. a. is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in west virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive
and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the f. b. i. i don't remember but i think there's
yeah that's officially
i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh
turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago
uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
[noise]
so how you like new jersey
right i guess uh i don't know what part of new jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
right uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
[laughter]
right
well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
yeah
that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without e._t._r. emission control systems on their cars and things like that
yeah and it's like
sure
right i guess from what i hear though uh next year ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california
yeah
right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick
[laughter]
uh i was reading a an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh
it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the cfc's but
uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely
right
right
yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries
because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c._f._c. production but
it
go ahead
um-hum
right and that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
[laughter]
if if that makes any sense uh in terms of
exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh
i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize
those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles
and it's it's increasing even as far near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places
so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not
[laughter]
not a real good one actually but
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time
okay so you've got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think
yeah denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst
sure
yeah denver's that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley
kind of like mexico city does i guess mexico city is historically been one of the worst in the in in the world for that
but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in orlando florida and
there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver but you can
exactly
yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but it's kind of it's
[noise]
uh it's pretty good you know you get uh
closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
[noise] yeah it's when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial
but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of new jersey exists actually very
yeah you you go even a few wi- miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
but uh
oh de- definitely it's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road they're all
yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year
you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets
so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline
it it is coming from cars though
i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluor- chlorofar -fluorocarbons
well it it
no it's the type of thing there that uh you know the third world countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial
so they're on the different part of the cycle of the us the us used you know all the air pollution stuff
and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to
yeah
no well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction
which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and
replacing some of the pollutants
mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between atlanta washington d._c. area
[vocalized-noise]
well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the with the inversion and los angeles and a- rest of california which is just terrible it sounds
uh-huh
yeah
yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of uh heavy industry you know that would be causing it
um-hum
it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high
it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn't seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar
uh-huh
yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high
uh-huh
oh boy
yeah that does make it difficult
uh well i used to work in finance but i i don't any longer
i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours
but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question
uh-huh
right
right that's what's irritating
[noise] it's also irritating that
you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how [noise] how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem to hear that that it changes or improves
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
um
hm i don't remember hearing that
uh-huh
i'm from texas but now i live in california
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
[noise] which counties are that where where do you live
[noise]
and what state is that in
still in texas
[noise]
[laughter] yeah
course in texas at least you still don't have income tax
[laughter]
[noise]
well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar
we don't uh we it there's there's too much um
uh
pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the t._v.
you know
but i
right that uh i just i just pay you you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property
i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean i've got five and a half acres it's out in the country
and if i could get what they're charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute
you know so that that's why i just don't uh
there's a lot of you know a lot of expense
as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldn't be spending our money on
but uh
i- i'm i'm very uh i'm a single parent so i'm very touchy about taking every dad gum dime i make [laughter]
it does
really does are y- y- are you acc- an accountant or
uh-huh
right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax m- the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that
but it
you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh
and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that
that's a that's a bigger
problem to me than than having to pay them
right
well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our
federal government is our uh why in the world they don't get rid of
one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because that's costing that's costing the taxpayer m- multimillions
and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um
i don't i've never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the united states that only has one housing i meant one governing body
okay there is there's one state i've i in fac- i don't know whether it's new hampshire it's a northern state
um
or new england state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um
you know they their taxes are are
more well spent
but uh no i've you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i can't change
but uh
what s- what part of the country are you from
okay
i'm course i'm
i'm from texas too but um i think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here
so
i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh benedict county and i live in smith county
texas
still in texas you hear this texas accent
[laughter]
i can't get rid of it [laughter]
well i think we pay it in other ways
i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways it's funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tigh- higher tax rate for a single person
than they do for a married couple
this is for everybo- for for private and commercial sector uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that you if you gonna take a job
you know and then they say well we're we're gonna
we're gonna test you you know periodically or something like this because the job is of the security nature or for the you know and the public safety or something that's might be one thing but i really believe that the employee
[noise] should have the right of of before he takes a job of making that decision there's just uh
there's too many false positives and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have
a
a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here
you have to go an- and here you go pee in the bottle an- and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if i- if if i- if it what happens this time and they they just [noise] that the testing p- part of it is just really bad
[noise] yeah they are they are th- it's [noise] one of the reason is because of the cost
and when you have such a magnitude of people and you have a company and you're trying to [noise] you're trying to stay afloat and you're you're you're you're having to get these tests and these tests are very expensive so what happens is that
sometimes you get so you're getting through a a testing company th- that's we would might say just for
terms is f- a fly by night company something like
hi [laughter] [vocalized-noise] this is drug testing for government employees only or was it for everybody
is i didn't i didn't really i don't really know much about this are i didn't realize that false positives were such a risk
uh-huh
[noise] oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because
i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the
belief that uh any particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some
very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway
so uh i just i i'm just basically against it
uh [laughter] i also i also don't have enough faith in our [noise] our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while
[laughter]
uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that
yeah do you i
yeah
yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh there are there are some other things i'm a- i'm against also i thi- i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against
so and so so i'm sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have [laughter] ei- either you execute them
and uh you're done with it or you know you throw them you throw them in jail for some incredibly long period of time
and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh o- other cell mates you know
so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you
got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but
you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh [laughter] it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment
um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably haven't really signed up to the idea of you know our co- i mean most western people's concept of civilization you know
and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um
but [noise] you know i i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to
to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because i think there are probably a lot of instances where um
you get into a situation where somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something
and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh
some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know [laughter] and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society
and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or
you know killing a cop who's trying to get him to you know come in to pay his [vocalized-noise] there's a million there's a million things
you know that i can ima- million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know
[noise]
um-hum
[laughter]
well that's probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually i'm i'm in favor of it um well this ought to be an interesting discussion uh [laughter] um
i my basic reason is that uh if someone uh willfully takes a life of another individual um i think that they have in most cases forfeited um their
convention by which they agree to abide to when when they enter into society um you know they have there's a a convention that you know you shall not kill other individuals
um and if you can kill with impunity um then that kind of makes you king of the hill in a society that that can't control you
uh and if you've shown that that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals that that you kill uh cold-bloodedly or whatever
then uh it's probably uh a good thing to remove remove you from that society
um and one probably one of the more effective ways of of doing that is through the death penalty uh because it's a highly visible sort of action um
and it also sends a message that you know this this sort of behavior is not tolerable within the society and you will forfeit all your rights
uh if you engage in such activity
so
well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden
uh because they'd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible uh because they're rotting away in a jail uh and the taxpayers are paying you know for them to sit there and twiddle away and and make license plates or something [laughter]
well yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
right right [laughter]
exactly exactly
um-hum
okay
how so uh
[laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
[noise]
um i don't know um does your do you have recycling in atlanta
uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you
um-hum into the different box
yeah [vocalized-noise] up here like new hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's
that's not real
that's not real popular with the states around us because
the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles ev- everybody comes across the border [laughter] to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
but
i- i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more
and i
there's a big problem here with like landfills
uh like
they the the landfills are j- are just like filling up with stuff
and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it becau- just so that we could save the space in those things
yeah [laughter]
i i was
i- i don't know when i was in when i- i was [vocalized-noise] last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made
let's see he made he made a lot of money working be- because like in in the states like massachusetts and vermont and all the states around new hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
that's where it's like every ev- every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it
and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it
but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
the law says that if they sell they have to collect
but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh
he
he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor
collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot
and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you s- like you were saying
they they lost like big money on because they can't rec- they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be remelded remolded or mel- melted into into other things
and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
but i don't know i i wonder you know shou-
should they be making things that like just can't be reused
uh
it kind of i- i don't i don't and well
should i be buying things that can't be reused
i
yeah well you know [noise] i- i can't something i can't figure out is it
do you ev- d- you ev- did you ever see those big old coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
at at what point in time did it get to be
at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
[noise]
uh yeah i see [noise] seen some uh there's some trucks that come around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big containers on them and they'll go and uh
and collect collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do
well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh
in your home and then put it out on the curb and the- and they just throw the matching color uh
container yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well uh it's kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting station down here and uh they were talking about recycling and
they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but
they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that uh was at a recycling center but it was costing them uh
about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it
so [laughter] so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them
and uh
i'm not sure i
oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
uh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it's uh
uh
something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying
everything is you know if it's not convenient people don't want it
and usually convenience means waste [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
[noise] so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost
you know there there's a there's a there's a trade off of our civil rights
against i guess our employer's right to to having a good job or something
um-hum
yeah uh well tha- that's a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isn't this isn't exactly disagreement wi-
i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people
but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on
well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they- they're going to get caught um having drugs that
that tha- that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because he might be coming in any minute you know
um-hum
well the the uh the mayor of baltimore is a rhodes scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was
taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um
in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone
um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh switzerland opened up a um uh a park
and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the swiss have they decided to close it down
so uh i don't know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there aren't going to that there isn't a perfect solution
that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down
yes we do we do
[noise]
uh i don't don't really see the employers as having a whole lot to do with it i've already it the um privilege of being a victim of random drug testing i spent four years in the marine corps and had to pee in a bottle on command
and it was really a really aggravating and time wasting thing to do um the thing that i really hated most about it was the total waste behind it all they would get maybe
between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would
you know we'd lose the whole morning what is that that's a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me
i wasn't happy with it at all in fact after i got out i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesn't seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate
um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well
now that's implying that um as a punitive kind of a thing as well you definitely want to discourage that is that kind of what you're saying
yeah well i guess that's a good policy then if uh you're definitely for eradicating drugs from society i'm not so certain that that's a a worthwhile goal right now
it looks like there's a lot of problems with um you know keeping drugs illegal things that are really scary a lot of people are dying and there's a lot of bloodshed and that that disturbs me i live downtown and uh man
right diagonal across from campus is uh teakwood homes it's the oldest housing project in the country roosevelt opened it and man there's shootings in there nightly and if it wasn't for the uh
you know the the high profit margin i don't think it would be going on i don't think that uh we'd have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well there's at least one nasty bloody
violent crime per year um over here where one of the students is a victim
uh-huh
is that the park yeah
[noise] yeah i just saw that in the news here recently
yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions
i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the us the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment
yeah
and it's funny how today in movies and all we really glorify those gangsters and that lifestyle it's kind of spooky
i gue- i guess even today in today's movies a lot
ever um
hello
yeah okay so we're started i guess i'll p- press one again [noise]
there
uh i'm surprised it's not telling us that that uh
we're going but at any rate um had do you have such a program uh where you work
well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to texas instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was
benign i uh really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that uh
uh you know we we want to stamp out um drug use
uh and uh the it's certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs
um
and i don't really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the se- because uh drug use is
uh a dangerous influence on other people in society
um there wa- i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who um
were rabidly opposed to it and i i gradually became
proselytized uh by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there there're couple things one is the is the insult of it
perhaps as a um
preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to
uh employees who are tried and proven uh that they've been asked to do they're gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face
and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because
uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled i- in a sense
to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say [noise] you've got to take a drug test
uh as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone
um-hum
right
was that on a nee- on a need basis or [laughter]
oh i see all right
uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at texas instruments was the um
u- unproductive nature of it that basically uh
drugs is not a problem at texas instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government
uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the the likelihood of finding drug users in the t._i. population is very very low
and um and so
uh people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the the testing uh requirement from the government
[noise]
hello
um-hum
okay
no i don't and uh
i can't say that i'm unhappy that we don't uh or happy you know either way i guess not being not being involved in it
uh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in um
someone who obviously had a problem with it um someone who had um well i won't say behavioral problems but uh
you know noticeable signs or you know got caught on the job you know uh in that case if they really wanted to help the employee it's sort of an enforced uh
enforced clean period um but you know
yeah
i'd
that's true that that sort of sing- singling a person out i guess i could see that side it of it as well well you can see i really haven't given it a whole lot of thought i'm i work for a privately held uh
uh systems integrator and uh
we are family oriented as a company and uh we we don't have uh
any any problems that uh anyone knows about if you know what i mean there may be problems but no one is aware of them so it it's sort of a an invisible thing for us um [noise]
there's no real requirement for it um [vocalized-noise] i did work for a company where i had to take a psyche profile once but uh that's another story
no all uh uh um everybody had to take one
but uh [laughter] thank you very much that's uh that's another that's another matter entirely but yeah i guess uh i guess i would say now now tha- now that uh you've presented that case i would have to say that
uh random i- if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out
um-hum
oh sure you have to be sharp
[noise]
well what kind of uh programs do y'all have up there for recycling
um-hum
is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or a collection center
oh okay
right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics
um but it's not real convenient like you said for lots of other things um and
it it is kind of nice though because you can put everything in together and you don't have to sort it out which is nice
no
uh you just they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it there's a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is convenient but if you want to recycle anything other than their list you know good luck [laughter]
um we have a couple of collection places around but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins
for all the different sorting things you have to do
right
well what's kind of interesting is here when the program started they
made a big deal about it but they only gave it to like five thousand houses which in atlanta is nothing you know and it was interesting because it was the only reason we got it is because we're sort of on the outskirts of this
rather plush area so [laughter] you can tell where they put the recycling uh program in place so atlanta really hasn't spread it out very much at all yet i don't think um i guess
budgetary restraints
um no i live off campus
yeah pretty far off
right no it's it's the city the s- georgia tech has it's own well has been trying to get it's own recycling program uh uh operated through the student government
but there they've tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans
for a living and they're afraid that that's going to attract crime onto campus having a ready supply of cans
[laughter] no well i don't know wh- wh- you know what their their philosophy was on that
but uh th- so they it's kind of a crime that we have all these students wanting to do this and n- no cooperation to to get that program going
but
a a friend of mine and i had also thought a while back about doing some recycling on our own to make some money and i think it was interesting i found out that glass
is only worth like a penny a pound
and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds well that's great but that's a dollar [laughter]
so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do
uh-huh
right
wow
yeah well now i know that i know that the same thing applies for aluminum it's much more profitable than glass
um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because there's ev- we'd been going out to the bars around here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles
so we thought well you got this ready market you know the
these bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet there's there's almost no way you could make money at it
because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit you'd make because glass is you know but i'm sure that as far as aluminum
[noise]
okay so
um around here we can recycle almost anything um we have paper and cans and uh newspaper i guess
um and then i guess plastic and glass it's a little harder to do but you we can recycle those as well
there's curbside but um for items like glass and and plastic it's only like once every three weeks or something crazy like that
so you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to put anything out any other night so [laughter]
right
oh yeah so you don't have to split anything up
oh okay
well
[laughter] uh-huh
right
well i uh the last place i lived was really it was in new jersey as well but it was um
it was really a lot hard harder to do it because um it's different depending on what town you're in basically every town is different which i think that that's crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but
yeah
uh-huh
right
are you
are you
oh yeah are you living at school or are you outside of school
oh okay so it's not just the school that's doing it or
okay
right
right
oh
okay i thought they were afraid of putting them out of work or something
okay
right
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
well not for individuals but like my company uh started doing recycling because it became mandatory in the state i i think it was mandatory in the state but they did it and they started a recycling program
just of paper i guess
and in two years they saved like four million dollars
um they that's how much money they got paid for their paper
and
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
right
