sw04000-A_000000-000622 [noise] you said you're are fin[ancial]- uh financial planner so do you work with individual um
sw04000-A_000622-000874 like companies or i mean
sw04000-A_002077-002504 so how do you handle your own account [laughter]
sw04000-A_002504-002788 your your own budget [laughter]
sw04000-A_004197-004893 hm [noise] right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and
sw04000-A_005020-005841 well good [laughter] but we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on but we don't spend
sw04000-A_005841-006162 um frivolously either
sw04000-A_006162-007312 uh i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know it's not that rigid um
sw04000-A_007532-008797 hm um i know though i'm expecting and um we're thinking about cutting down to one salary [noise] and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our
sw04000-A_008797-009825 [noise] income because_1 i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um
sw04000-A_009825-011081 so i think when [laughter] [laughter-when] [laughter-it] [laughter-comes] [laughter-to] [laughter-that] [laughter-time] period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now we're struggling with it oh
sw04000-A_011081-012363 [noise] the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and h[is]- my husband's car is American mine's Japanese but his is breaking [laughter-down] [laughter-a] [laughter-lot] [laughter-more] you know i haven't had any problems and were were
sw04000-A_012363-012968 uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks
sw04000-A_012968-013857 you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest
sw04000-A_013857-014141 y[ou]- you know interest rate
sw04000-A_016113-016251 [noise]
sw04000-A_016680-017247 [noise] we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions
sw04000-A_017247-017958 so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to
sw04000-A_017958-018766 you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars
sw04000-A_018901-019495 oh good [laughter] smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart
sw04000-A_019686-019826 um
sw04000-A_019944-020339 and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments
sw04000-A_020339-020964 so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
sw04000-A_020964-021563 and i- i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are a[nd]- uh
sw04000-A_021563-022304 well that's in our goals i guess for this y[ear]- first quarter is to examine our financial
sw04000-A_022304-023542 standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
sw04000-A_023542-024587 [noise] oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference
sw04000-A_024587-025943 in the interest rate to make a different i mean [noise] to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um
sw04000-A_025943-026576 money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but
sw04000-A_026576-027110 [noise] right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now
sw04000-A_027110-027225 that
sw04000-A_028193-028325 right
sw04000-A_028712-028845 right
sw04000-B_000000-000065 [noise]
sw04000-B_000232-000370 yes
sw04000-B_000834-001656 well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal
sw04000-B_001656-002099 uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people
sw04000-B_002426-002627 how do i handle my own account
sw04000-B_002627-003446 uh well the first part of be[ing]- of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one don't have any debt
sw04000-B_003446-004179 [noise] so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also
sw04000-B_004760-005124 oh that's great you're ahead of most of the people out there then
sw04000-B_005124-005271 [laughter]
sw04000-B_006088-006298 uh-huh [noise]
sw04000-B_007249-007523 well a budget does not have to be rigid
sw04000-B_008901-009071 sure
sw04000-B_012036-012195 um-hum
sw04000-B_013830-013941 right
sw04000-B_013941-014055 [noise]
sw04000-B_014055-015110 [noise] well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results
sw04000-B_015110-016170 and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not
sw04000-B_016170-016723 and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it
sw04000-B_017188-017312 uh-huh
sw04000-B_018728-019032 well that is called smart budgeting
sw04000-B_019032-019341 [laughter]
sw04000-B_019341-019730 oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so
sw04000-B_019730-019947 that is very smart to do
sw04000-B_020932-021072 uh-huh
sw04000-B_024749-024877 right
sw04000-B_026520-026667 [laughter-right]
sw04000-B_027212-028251 well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it
sw04000-B_028251-028762 and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder
sw04000-B_028762-029847 [noise] and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergenc[ies]-

sw04001-B_012681-013299 no i don't know what it is i haven't even really looked at the vehicles much lately [laughter]
sw04001-B_013540-014063 oh yeah i think i probably will too because_1 i've had good luck with it never had hardly any problems
sw04001-B_014063-014380 you know and the one i had before was the same way
sw04001-B_014380-014958 yeah we had a [vocalized-noise] a uh Tercel before this an eight two Tercel
sw04001-B_014958-015183 and that thing never gave us any problems
sw04001-B_015183-015851 we had a wreck with it and uh [noise] the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that
sw04001-B_015851-016474 but um uh i will i will say this uh the the Celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it
sw04001-B_016474-017450 yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them_1 out because_1 we live you know our area's fairly congested and a lot of traffic so it's
sw04001-B_017450-018011 you know we use the clutch a lot [laughter] i do you're stopping and going a lot you know

sw04001-B_018394-019219 yeah and uh i don't i'm i'm you know i don't worry about getting a Japanese car you know everybody's talking about buying American and everything and
sw04001-B_019219-019762 uh i just like the Japanese cars i think i think they're better made [laughter]
sw04001-B_020230-020438 that's right yeah
sw04001-B_020438-021510 yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i- i g[ot]- i think the American cars they have the Japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course
sw04001-B_021510-022329 but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or th[at]- that kind of a car i- i don't think there there's any competition really i think the Japanese have them_1 beat [laughter]
sw04001-B_022498-022752 oh yeah sure i do too
sw04001-B_022752-022951 um-hum

sw04001-B_026287-027135 yeah they had the ST the GT and the GTS you know and the the ST is the uh cheaper [noise] version of all three of them_1 yeah
sw04001-B_027277-027465 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04001-B_027569-028249 yeah that's got a little [vocalized-noise] little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so
sw04001-B_028544-028715 yeah [laughter]
sw04001-B_028818-029225 oh yeah well that's the way mothers [laughter-are] [laughter]

sw04002-A_000911-001020 yeah
sw04002-A_001357-002068 well it's kind of hard to say uh because_1 i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years
sw04002-A_002068-002203 we just
sw04002-A_002203-002863 bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine
sw04002-A_002863-003039 and uh
sw04002-A_003173-003572 wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've [laughter-got] three cars of all things
sw04002-A_003572-003747 so uh
sw04002-A_003849-004001 probably
sw04002-A_004001-004410 we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan
sw04002-A_004702-005051 uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine
sw04002-A_005051-005350 and a Ford Crown Victoria
sw04002-A_005350-005642 and a little two seater CRX
sw04002-A_005856-006012 uh
sw04002-A_006252-006547 it's rather difficult to to project what kind of
sw04002-A_006652-006838 uh we'd
sw04002-A_006838-007432 look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh
sw04002-A_007432-007758 report or uh uh
sw04002-A_007758-008169 repair records that the various cars have
sw04002-A_008169-008417 and then of course we look into the prices
sw04002-A_008521-008659 and uh
sw04002-A_008659-009127 f[or]- uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer
sw04002-A_009127-009215 when
sw04002-A_009215-009723 when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them
sw04002-A_009723-009842 uh
sw04002-A_010017-010727 long[er]- a longer period of time uh i traded off a an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda
sw04002-A_010838-010935 so

sw04005-A_001306-001669 in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking
sw04005-A_002020-002178 uh-huh
sw04005-A_003534-003731 disintegrating
sw04005-A_004398-004997 yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure
sw04005-A_004997-005648 exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from
sw04005-A_005648-006354 i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned
sw04005-A_006354-007278 faxes and car phones and [laughter-VCRs] and all of that that make us so immediate th[ere]- there's no time for
sw04005-A_007278-007929 relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that
sw04005-A_008180-008374 oh yes [laughter]
sw04005-A_009838-010007 um-hum
sw04005-A_011074-011369 [noise] [laughter] exactly no patience
sw04005-A_011369-011574 no attention span
sw04005-A_011574-012528 these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer
sw04005-A_012528-013175 with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a
sw04005-A_013175-014022 is a a word that that suits most of America now we don't feel like we can in[fluence]- you know influence anything
sw04005-A_014022-014912 uh-huh uh-huh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and they're not going to let you through um
sw04005-A_014912-015179 and it's a bad feeling
sw04005-A_015848-016004 um-hum
sw04005-A_016004-016169 um-hum
sw04005-A_016532-016852 yeah go ahead [laughter]
sw04005-A_017479-017711 um-hum um-hum
sw04005-A_018875-019045 yeah then that's
sw04005-A_020522-020898 um-hum the in[terdependence]- interdependence in a nice way
sw04005-A_020898-021731 yeah i think uh i- i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it
sw04005-A_021731-022023 uh but but but the community
sw04005-A_022023-023169 however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and
sw04005-A_023169-024138 i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but
sw04005-A_024138-025286 you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know
sw04005-A_025286-026578 um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or some[thing]- i mean something you know [noise] even offices have started sort of becoming the community
sw04005-A_026578-026810 [noise]
sw04005-A_026810-026886 yeah
sw04005-A_027392-027633 um-hum and yeah
sw04005-A_028376-028506 yeah
sw04005-A_028684-029227 yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergener[ational]- generational
sw04005-A_029227-029847 community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and i[f]-
sw04005-B_000000-000421 [noise]
sw04005-B_000421-001468 i think it's pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um
sw04005-B_001601-002867 well technology but also mor[als]- morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be
sw04005-B_002867-003463 for me that's the biggest change it's so frustrating um to see everything
sw04005-B_003463-003610 [noise]
sw04005-B_003610-004443 disintegrating and losing con[trol]- your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society
sw04005-B_005292-005413 [noise]
sw04005-B_005906-006054 um-hum
sw04005-B_006272-006412 um-hum
sw04005-B_007865-008339 i think you're really right i think like well even with computers um
sw04005-B_008339-008986 you can there i mean there's so much that's happening in in that field and it
sw04005-B_008986-009356 it just has forced us to go so fast and
sw04005-B_009356-010274 um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and
sw04005-B_010274-011290 and just describes the scenery and what's been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well let's get to the point and
sw04005-B_011290-011478 yeah
sw04005-B_011478-011694 yeah exactly
sw04005-B_013887-014164 yeah you feel out of control
sw04005-B_014164-014337 yeah
sw04005-B_014520-014651 um-hum
sw04005-B_014780-014910 um-hum
sw04005-B_014910-015092 [noise]
sw04005-B_015092-015782 yeah it is it's really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are
sw04005-B_015782-016106 disintegrating and stuff it's just a real
sw04005-B_016106-016716 you don't have the the social networks we used to have to
sw04005-B_016716-017388 to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving
sw04005-B_017388-018585 you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do things you know in America it seems now it's independence is the thing and
sw04005-B_018585-018945 you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything
sw04005-B_018945-019439 whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and
sw04005-B_019439-020087 you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of
sw04005-B_020087-020598 you know when you're in trouble and you need so[meone]- you know someone to babysit the kids sure
sw04005-B_020702-020854 yeah
sw04005-B_020854-020982 exactly
sw04005-B_021678-021823 yeah
sw04005-B_022425-022580 um-hum
sw04005-B_025978-026154 yeah
sw04005-B_026527-026841 yeah i think i think because it's a necessity
sw04005-B_026841-027891 as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i gue[ss]- that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um
sw04005-B_027891-028792 temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know
sw04006-A_000000-000282 [noise] so do you do a lot of camping
sw04006-A_000639-001049 oh is that right uh-huh um
sw04006-A_001049-001879 [noise] my sons are in the boy scouts also uh so i know they go a lot of camping but i don't go with them_1 [laughter]
sw04006-A_001879-003127 but uh we used to live in California and we did a little bit of camping in California not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping
sw04006-A_004024-004243 oh who am i talking to
sw04006-A_004243-004937 oh i can't believe that [laughter] well we can talk about anything [laughter] well
sw04006-A_004937-005993 you know this is really funny because i i've tried to make these phone calls um whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we can't find another party and after th[ey]-
sw04006-A_005993-007419 they say that two times i can't keep hanging on the phone and i just saw that card down there and now i'm really supposed to be baking bread for Cistercian [laughter] i said oh i'll make another phone call i guess another five dollars helps [laughter] so anyway
sw04006-A_007419-008483 oh we have to talk about oh that's right we're on this recording thing well anyway um we used to go camping out in California up by Mendocino and um [noise] to um
sw04006-A_008483-009487 [noise] uh Lasson Park which is a vol[canic]- a volcanic park and uh that was absolutely extraordinary and the rangers there that uh
sw04006-A_009487-010814 do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was uh one of our uh major camping times that we enjoyed very very much
sw04006-A_010814-011171 [noise] uh do you ever go camping outside of the boy scouts
sw04006-A_012186-012386 oh yes
sw04006-A_012660-012816 uh-huh
sw04006-A_013251-013430 oh my
sw04006-A_014031-014386 um-hum um-hum um
sw04006-A_015274-015420 um-hum
sw04006-A_015551-015793 oh that's true too
sw04006-A_015793-015939 uh-huh
sw04006-A_016055-017382 we took one canoe trip in California now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of Webbie's that got this group together
sw04006-A_017382-018431 and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um
sw04006-A_018431-019664 i- i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the Russian River yeah
sw04006-A_019785-019973 yeah yeah
sw04006-A_019973-021246 yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was Webbie's first time doing this also and we just t[rusted]- uh trusted in the uh knowledge of
sw04006-A_021246-021786 this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our
sw04006-A_021786-022980 life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just uh kind of uh
sw04006-A_022980-023708 stayed by camp site and uh cooked [laughter] but it it was it was very exciting and
sw04006-A_023708-024169 really very nice and um i wouldn't mind doing something like that again
sw04006-A_024169-025291 and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you don't know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do [noise] but um
sw04006-A_025291-025666 it it was quite an experience uh
sw04006-A_025666-026269 um-hum um-hum yeah yeah so
sw04006-A_026269-026815 [noise] oh yes well Sean is Daniel went last summer so
sw04006-A_026815-027661 no no no he's not gonna go again this time but uh you're gonna inherit Sean on this trip and uh um-hum
sw04006-A_027661-028580 i know uh-huh have you been out there before oh you have[n't]- well Daniel says it's i think it's really quite challenging
sw04006-A_028580-029962 uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part
sw04006-B_000000-000233 [noise]
sw04006-B_000233-000729 [noise] uh well yeah a fair amount mostly with boy scouts
sw04006-B_003088-003658 well mostly uh well boy scout camps near uh near Dallas uh
sw04006-B_003658-004315 i[n]- in fact i i think i know your sons Danny and Sean right Jan Novak
sw04006-B_004446-004787 but we can talk about camping none the less
sw04006-B_004787-004941 they didn't
sw04006-B_007237-007652 but we we should talk about camping because_1 they're recording this
sw04006-B_008798-008943 um-hum
sw04006-B_011102-011653 well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids Marie and i would go
sw04006-B_011653-012721 we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate New York where there are a lot of lakes up near Lake Placid and in that area and in Northern Ontario which is also full of lakes
sw04006-B_012721-013438 and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe
sw04006-B_013438-014266 uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake
sw04006-B_014266-015313 and so that that was a i i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you don't have to watch the weight so much
sw04006-B_015313-015856 and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean
sw04006-B_015856-015911 [noise]
sw04006-B_015911-016068 and that's
sw04006-B_019280-020101 what what river was that yeah i've s[een]- i've seen the Russian River we never went canoeing on it that that can get pretty fast
sw04006-B_021392-021546 um-hum
sw04006-B_022164-022302 um-hum
sw04006-B_023202-023501 sure sure
sw04006-B_025424-025755 yeah well you you have to be careful
sw04006-B_025755-025967 you have to be careful
sw04006-B_026094-026438 your your guys are going to Philmont are they
sw04006-B_026438-026524 agai[n]-

sw04006-B_027946-028063 no
sw04006-B_028516-028652 really
sw04007-A_000000-000502 [noise] okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like
sw04007-A_000901-001053 um-hum
sw04007-A_001498-001636 um-hum
sw04007-A_002779-002939 [laughter]

sw04007-A_005327-005554 because_1 they're they're real young
sw04007-A_005554-006104 yeah because_1 that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now
sw04007-A_006483-006613 uh-huh
sw04007-A_006903-007033 oh
sw04007-A_007033-007180 uh-huh

sw04007-A_009119-009251 um-hum
sw04007-A_009372-010300 yeah yeah they'll be because_1 at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn
sw04007-A_010300-011538 well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and
sw04007-A_011538-012633 even though i had just gotten my Master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and
sw04007-A_012633-013753 i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really
sw04007-A_013753-014710 paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because_1 i miss working with adults and uh
sw04007-A_014710-015320 you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language [noise]
sw04007-A_015546-016421 right right [laughter-and] as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um
sw04007-A_016421-017815 but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of
sw04007-A_017815-018020 of set up for her so
sw04007-A_018642-018791 um-hum
sw04007-A_019026-019156 um-hum
sw04007-A_019523-019661 oh
sw04007-A_019901-020031 uh-huh
sw04007-A_020371-020514 um-hum
sw04007-A_021929-022714 oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area
sw04007-A_022850-023048 [laughter-oh] [laughter-okay]
sw04007-A_023717-023859 um-hum
sw04007-A_024520-024957 oh yeah because_1 now you're depending on other people that you don't know
sw04007-A_025209-025359 uh-huh
sw04007-A_026306-026526 yeah yeah
sw04007-A_026526-026669 yeah
sw04007-A_026890-027087 that's right yeah
sw04007-A_027087-027778 and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure
sw04007-A_027778-028002 [noise] so [noise]
sw04007-A_028002-028599 that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around
sw04007-A_028964-029121 uh-huh
sw04007-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04007-B_000414-000969 [laughter] well i've got two kids one of them_1's a year old and one of them_1's going on three
sw04007-B_000969-002022 and in California anyways where i'm located my husband's in the Navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here
sw04007-B_002022-002473 they're either Mexican or Filipino and they don't speak English
sw04007-B_002473-002852 so it's like my kids pick up really funny words
sw04007-B_002852-003278 and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're [laughter-saying]
sw04007-B_003278-003809 and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars
sw04007-B_003809-004625 for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're [laughter-saying]
sw04007-B_005108-005252 um
sw04007-B_005252-005404 sometimes
sw04007-B_005504-005625 yeah
sw04007-B_006022-007124 like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan
sw04007-B_007124-008057 but he said it you know in i- i don't even re[member]- i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino i'm not even sure which language it was
sw04007-B_008057-008445 but he knew it was Peter Pan it's just he didn't say Peter Pan
sw04007-B_008445-008760 and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying
sw04007-B_008760-009188 but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it
sw04007-B_009188-009501 it's just [laughter] makes it hard to [laughter-understand]
sw04007-B_009986-010130 yeah
sw04007-B_012108-012281 yeah
sw04007-B_013823-014065 [laughter]
sw04007-B_015236-015785 yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences [laughter]
sw04007-B_016164-016394 really
sw04007-B_017899-018698 yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work
sw04007-B_018698-019087 there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work
sw04007-B_019087-019580 so we made a deal he's in the Navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship
sw04007-B_019580-019950 so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids
sw04007-B_019950-020646 but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime
sw04007-B_020646-021226 and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it
sw04007-B_021226-022225 it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from Arizona yeah really
sw04007-B_022225-022401 [noise] Mayer
sw04007-B_022644-022980 yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott [laughter]
sw04007-B_022980-023345 but um it's really strange because
sw04007-B_023345-024383 i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and
sw04007-B_024383-024588 it's really different here
sw04007-B_024869-025243 yeah {moneywise} and you don't know them_1 and you're worried you know
sw04007-B_025347-026387 i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care
sw04007-B_026387-026623 you know you always have that fear
sw04007-B_026623-026972 i got to find somebody r[eally]- you know really that i can depend on
sw04007-B_027657-027799 yeah
sw04007-B_028541-029386 well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions [laughter] and that may sound kind of strange but
sw04007-B_029386-029847 it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like [laughter] i want my child safe
sw04008-A_000000-000188 [noise] so um do you have a PC
sw04008-A_000451-001154 um-hum yeah one of my friends are into Macintoshes i have a um PC my a IBM PC myself
sw04008-A_001154-001530 a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six
sw04008-A_001639-001829 um
sw04008-A_001829-002842 um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh
sw04008-A_002842-003786 but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
sw04008-A_004868-005020 um-hum
sw04008-A_005020-005099 [noise]
sw04008-A_005423-005553 um-hum
sw04008-A_005756-006878 no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to Windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah
sw04008-A_006878-007343 [laughter] yeah it's ju[st]-
sw04008-A_007343-008279 um i want it i want it you know well [vocalized-noise] i ju[st]- i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a Macintosh um
sw04008-A_008852-009027 um-hum
sw04008-A_009027-009545 yeah i use[d]- that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school
sw04008-A_009948-010055 um-hum
sw04008-A_010170-010301 um-hum
sw04008-A_010428-010716 well do you use your computer for uh
sw04008-A_010716-011014 just things around the house or in the in the
sw04008-A_011014-011200 i see what do you do
sw04008-A_011964-012642 oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um
sw04008-A_012642-012977 are they are they based on on a on a um
sw04008-A_012977-013949 other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
sw04008-A_013949-014460 and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding
sw04008-A_014651-014798 um-hum
sw04008-A_014999-015930 well it was just uh when i was in high school i worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know
sw04008-A_015930-016518 spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
sw04008-A_016518-017296 imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
sw04008-A_017663-017800 um-hum
sw04008-A_018146-018266 um-hum
sw04008-A_018564-018984 oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
sw04008-A_019382-019503 um-hum
sw04008-A_020089-020230 um-hum
sw04008-A_020390-020508 um-hum
sw04008-A_021123-021434 yeah i'd imagine so um
sw04008-A_021434-021799 so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E
sw04008-A_022058-022262 [laughter]
sw04008-A_022826-023036 um-hum it it's ama[zing]-
sw04008-A_023218-024306 yes it it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a TRS eighty with four K on it
sw04008-A_024306-025229 and you know and then then i mo[ved]- and then i started playing with Apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four K you know
sw04008-A_025619-026130 uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them
sw04008-A_026130-026928 is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight K and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the [laughter-time]
sw04008-A_026928-027885 and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure a[bout]- about um Macintoshes but i know in IBM's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
sw04008-A_027885-028206 you know that's that's your low that's the low end
sw04008-A_028309-028443 um
sw04008-A_028577-028733 um-hum
sw04008-A_029751-029962 um-hum yeah imagine just to support
sw04008-B_000000-000123 [noise]
sw04008-B_000123-000492 yes i have a Macintosh SE thirty
sw04008-B_001061-001207 um-hum
sw04008-B_001725-002048 what do you use yours for mostly
sw04008-B_002638-002760 uh-huh
sw04008-B_003691-005018 well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just uh today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to
sw04008-B_005018-005512 send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
sw04008-B_005512-005835 uh are you using windows
sw04008-B_006275-006410 uh-huh
sw04008-B_006652-007126 uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh [laughter]
sw04008-B_008023-009150 um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now
sw04008-B_009483-010231 but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i don't have uh any compilers
sw04008-B_010231-010556 so i'm uh [noise] wa[nting]-
sw04008-B_010897-011162 i use it in my business
sw04008-B_011162-012040 i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs
sw04008-B_014346-015064 that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
sw04008-B_016447-016621 um-hum
sw04008-B_017223-018219 right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive
sw04008-B_018219-018662 and then i use it for te[sting]- uh data analysis on testing so
sw04008-B_018852-019409 well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
sw04008-B_019409-020134 you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
sw04008-B_020134-021181 and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
sw04008-B_021741-022598 well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly [laughter] and with smaller files [laughter] i can't believe you know i've got uh
sw04008-B_022598-023350 five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E i had a hundred twenty eight K [laughter]
sw04008-B_023888-024021 [noise]
sw04008-B_024247-024381 yeah
sw04008-B_024938-025121 oh the old
sw04008-B_025121-025771 the old Apple uh the the the original Apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it
sw04008-B_025771-025943 [noise]
sw04008-B_026133-026324 my goodness
sw04008-B_026759-026934 uh-huh [laughter]
sw04008-B_026934-027066 [noise]
sw04008-B_027804-027934 um-hum
sw04008-B_028335-028631 well the SE thirty goes up to eight
sw04008-B_028631-029745 but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
sw04009-A_000000-000113 it's recycling
sw04009-A_001603-001880 exactly i agree
sw04009-A_002853-003999 well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be
sw04009-A_004684-004938 there's not a market for it right
sw04009-A_005395-005952 yeah [noise] well uh do you have a recycling program where you live
sw04009-A_006560-006924 uh-huh [noise] do you have plastics and that kind o[f]- kind of stuff
sw04009-A_007322-007467 uh-huh
sw04009-A_007627-007944 so this is like i[n]- within the school
sw04009-A_008144-008406 do they have curbside recycling
sw04009-A_008406-009284 that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh
sw04009-A_009284-010163 get that because i mean it's terr[ible]- it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all y[our]- lug all that stuff you know dirty
sw04009-A_010163-010744 you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door
sw04009-A_011019-011707 well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some o[thers]- others won't
sw04009-A_011707-012199 so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have
sw04009-A_012365-013146 [laughter] i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible
sw04009-A_013146-014032 but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper
sw04009-A_014032-014729 but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases
sw04009-A_014729-015069 but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle
sw04009-A_015069-015502 and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable
sw04009-A_015502-016165 so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it
sw04009-A_016465-016713 yeah exactly
sw04009-A_016713-017259 um-hum yep well anything else
sw04009-A_017398-017869 well reduce reuse and recycle right [laughter]
sw04009-A_017869-018427 [laughter] that's right i try to remember them_1 i guess we've covered it
sw04009-A_018427-018755 [noise] it was nice talking to you bye-bye now
sw04009-B_000000-000090 [noise]
sw04009-B_000090-000488 [noise] well uh i think it's a really good thing because um
sw04009-B_000488-001699 of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste uh you know make them_1 and then throw them away and bury them_1 out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them_1
sw04009-B_001827-002907 and uh there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle
sw04009-B_003923-004821 yeah you're right there but then there's things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one -[w]ill
sw04009-B_004821-004956 yeah
sw04009-B_004956-005476 or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so
sw04009-B_005866-006659 oh yeah uh i go to Indiana University here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials
sw04009-B_006891-007749 yeah and also the uh well the University's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff an[d]-
sw04009-B_007857-008259 yeah within the school and also the city here has uh
sw04009-B_008259-008549 yeah monthly curbside recycling
sw04009-B_008652-008773 uh-huh
sw04009-B_008995-009135 right
sw04009-B_010044-010200 right
sw04009-B_010696-011158 right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own uh
sw04009-B_011626-011762 uh-huh
sw04009-B_012113-012443 right sounds like you are an avid recycler
sw04009-B_012615-012767 are you
sw04009-B_013050-013190 uh-huh
sw04009-B_013869-014147 right yeah we do that at work too
sw04009-B_015005-015155 right
sw04009-B_015424-015575 uh-huh
sw04009-B_016083-016225 right
sw04009-B_016225-016572 well aren't there pop cans that are like that also
sw04009-B_016572-016856 because_1 they have mixed metals or something
sw04009-B_017244-017477 -[w]ell no not really
sw04009-B_017654-017950 right [laughter] words to live by
sw04009-B_017950-018355 [laughter]
sw04009-B_018355-018523 okay
sw04009-B_018523-018755 you too bye-bye
sw04009-B_018755-018989 [noise]
sw04010-A_000000-000202 [noise] what do you think about drug testing
sw04010-A_001710-002010 yeah yeah but
sw04010-A_002854-002975 uh-huh
sw04010-A_003394-003739 oh is [laughter-that] right was it a large or a small company
sw04010-A_003739-003945 [noise]
sw04010-A_003945-004039 uh-huh
sw04010-A_004554-004635 uh-huh
sw04010-A_005048-005177 is that right
sw04010-A_005993-006342 well sure i there's that part of it i think and
sw04010-A_006342-006807 and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company
sw04010-A_006807-008279 that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or
sw04010-A_008279-008807 consumer products or whatever you'd you'd have an equal chance of being tested
sw04010-A_008807-009444 i d[on't]- i don't know i just think it's a sick thing that we've [laughter-come] to [laughter-that] i don't like the way the world's going
sw04010-A_010720-010849 well
sw04010-A_010849-011599 does it i've heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive
sw04010-A_011599-011829 and and that's what
sw04010-A_011829-012711 what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs
sw04010-A_012711-013416 or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive
sw04010-A_014029-014200 uh no urine
sw04010-A_014328-014818 yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate
sw04010-A_014922-015189 but that's not what they're doing at my company
sw04010-A_015189-015664 no it's urine samples i haven't been tapped yet [laughter] to do this
sw04010-A_015821-016221 but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that
sw04010-A_018297-018440 yeah well
sw04010-A_018440-018696 [laughter]
sw04010-A_018696-018955 yeah i- i suppose i suppose it's
sw04010-A_018955-019638 it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind
sw04010-A_019638-020003 you know everybody has databases these [laughter-days]
sw04010-A_020129-020563 and they know a lot more about me than i'll ever remember i'm sure
sw04010-A_020948-021558 yeah well i'm i'm certainly certainly sure that uh any drug test results would become a part of that
sw04010-A_021797-021940 probably so
sw04010-A_022593-022698 yeah
sw04010-A_022698-023150 well i certainly believe in it for uh [laughter] people like airline pilots
sw04010-A_023150-023537 or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers
sw04010-A_024583-024695 uh-huh
sw04010-A_025031-025185 oh sure
sw04010-A_026007-026120 oh
sw04010-A_026750-026846 yeah
sw04010-A_027231-027302 huh
sw04010-A_027559-027818 well i guess it would i guess so
sw04010-A_027818-028013 well i don't know i [vocalized-noise]
sw04010-A_028013-028845 i- i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i'm totally straight would never consider using [laughter-drugs]
sw04010-A_028928-029596 but uh i[t]- it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that you're innocent
sw04010-A_029753-029885 on the other hand uh
sw04010-B_000169-000638 i think it's pretty good i think they should do it especially in uh in companies where
sw04010-B_000638-001290 uh you deal with uh either with other people or with uh stuff that uh
sw04010-B_001290-001473 i want to say uh
sw04010-B_001473-001848 deals directly with people's lives like [laughter-hospitals] and stuff [laughter]
sw04010-B_001848-002189 um everywhere uh you know when uh when i was in college
sw04010-B_002189-002919 when uh everywhere i- i applied a job for uh pretty much did a drug test because_1 most of them were like defense contractors and stuff
sw04010-B_002919-003287 except uh the the last job the job i actually took
sw04010-B_003287-003450 they didn't care [laughter]
sw04010-B_003450-003639 [laughter-so]
sw04010-B_003639-005092 it's a big company it's uh MCI telecommunications and i think uh they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that uh or run the heavy machinery but they don't require it for you know the engineering positions
sw04010-B_005092-005317 yeah i was kind of surprised but
sw04010-B_005317-006042 defense contractors only want you doing it because uh they don't want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you [laughter-know]
sw04010-B_006765-006852 right
sw04010-B_007006-007068 um-hum
sw04010-B_007486-007592 um-hum
sw04010-B_007592-007756 hum
sw04010-B_007756-007892 right
sw04010-B_008760-008838 um-hum
sw04010-B_009151-009301 yeah i mean
sw04010-B_009410-010046 yeah i mean i have i have no pro[blem]- i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff
sw04010-B_010046-010872 and you know i- i don't know i guess it's bad you know to to go inside somebody you know hand them_1 a urine sample bottle you [laughter-know] but uh
sw04010-B_011504-011697 right right
sw04010-B_012397-012500 right
sw04010-B_013357-013452 uh-huh
sw04010-B_013452-014033 well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair
sw04010-B_014033-014173 they can uh
sw04010-B_014173-014383 well can't they also test your hair
sw04010-B_014748-014896 right right
sw04010-B_015107-015232 oh really
sw04010-B_015497-015702 [laughter]

sw04010-B_016157-016299 uh-huh
sw04010-B_016299-017060 well they uh i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if uh
sw04010-B_017060-017326 you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company
sw04010-B_017326-017479 tests positive
sw04010-B_017479-018061 i mean i- i- i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again
sw04010-B_018061-018191 and uh
sw04010-B_018191-018347 test negative
sw04010-B_018347-018568 and any way have time for that
sw04010-B_018568-018752 wouldn't it [laughter]
sw04010-B_019260-019346 yeah
sw04010-B_019592-019652 um-hum
sw04010-B_019860-020098 [laughter]
sw04010-B_020458-020999 yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going [laughter-around]
sw04010-B_021509-021791 yeah that's true i guess they put it in your personnel file
sw04010-B_021906-022176 yeah because_1 i i'm i'm you know
sw04010-B_022176-022619 i'm surprised they don't do it you know in uh in my organization
sw04010-B_022619-022747 but uh
sw04010-B_023082-023182 right
sw04010-B_023502-023721 uh-huh [laughter-yeah]
sw04010-B_023721-023998 train [vocalized-noise] and also uh uh
sw04010-B_023998-024371 uh boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains
sw04010-B_024371-024640 but small the uh small personal boats
sw04010-B_024640-025121 they had trouble with uh not just substance abuse but uh alcohol abuse and stuff
sw04010-B_025121-025542 and they [laughter-had] these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested an[d]-
sw04010-B_025542-025819 and they finally said no more alcohol out there
sw04010-B_025819-026072 you know in uh like where i used to live in Virginia
sw04010-B_026072-026774 they had a lot of problems with uh with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and uh drug related incidents
sw04010-B_026774-027285 so they finally just said uh if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to
sw04010-B_027285-027463 so [laughter]
sw04010-B_027463-027604 straightened a few people out
sw04010-B_028411-028478 um
sw04010-B_028638-028750 [noise]
sw04010-B_028750-029076 um-hum well you know i'm the same way
sw04010-B_029358-029444 um-hum
sw04010-B_029562-029684 um-hum um-hum
sw04011-A_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04011-A_000039-001225 okay well um about_1 capital punishment first of all i know that in uh Texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess that's the uh preferred method have they used anything else
sw04011-A_001225-001454 in in Texas in your memory
sw04011-A_001802-001909 i see
sw04011-A_002087-003158 [vocalized-noise] oh [laughter] yeah that's that's kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the Dahlmer case at all
sw04011-A_003305-003567 that one's a little too grizzly too huh
sw04011-A_004904-005039 um-hum
sw04011-A_005846-005955 hum
sw04011-A_006564-007451 i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution
sw04011-A_008272-008399 um-hum
sw04011-A_009625-009751 um-hum
sw04011-A_010290-010413 um-hum
sw04011-A_010413-011853 well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve
sw04011-A_011853-013122 um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution
sw04011-A_013122-013461 yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah
sw04011-A_015325-015463 um-hum
sw04011-A_016283-017468 um well [vocalized-noise] to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business
sw04011-A_017468-018072 um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is
sw04011-A_018072-019121 that i- i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04011-A_019121-019988 in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there tru[st]- uh people don't trust the cops who who uh
sw04011-A_019988-020933 run the beat [noise] so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary
sw04011-A_020933-021386 to keep crime down because
sw04011-A_021386-022550 uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so
sw04011-A_022550-023393 capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place
sw04011-A_024002-024280 oh yeah as as uh
sw04011-A_024581-024803 yeah
sw04011-A_025142-026507 yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um [noise] Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men
sw04011-A_026507-027843 and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation
sw04011-B_000000-000089 [noise]
sw04011-B_000820-000949 yeah
sw04011-B_001204-002119 i don't know to tell you the truth i don't follow it uh any more than i have to but i do know someone was just recently uh
sw04011-B_002119-002305 put to sleep
sw04011-B_002579-002747 exactly
sw04011-B_003161-004125 ooh [laughter] no more tha[n]- again no more than i have to um i have very mixed feelings about this whole issue um
sw04011-B_004125-004952 uh i- i really don't like the idea of of uh death penalty ca[pital]- capital punishment however you want to put it
sw04011-B_004952-005263 um and yet i do
sw04011-B_005263-005793 concur that there are some people that have to be kept away
sw04011-B_005793-006640 forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that there's nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me
sw04011-B_007434-008272 i- i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if i'd really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed
sw04011-B_008272-008649 i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed
sw04011-B_008649-009095 you know there there have been been some criminals who said
sw04011-B_009095-009630 and this is what i want and i can yeah i can see that side of it
sw04011-B_009630-010329 uh because_1 i don't know what life is like what what life means if you're in jail the rest of your life
sw04011-B_011797-011931 um-hum
sw04011-B_012995-013314 a a deterrent or righ[t]- yeah
sw04011-B_013795-014976 i'm not i don't know uh uh you know i don't think we've we haven't used it enough they say in in in countries where you know you're gonna have your hand cut off you know if you steal et cetera that
sw04011-B_014976-015708 that it has that that there is less crime uh we certainly let our people out
sw04011-B_015708-016356 way too fast i don't know i don't think i've got enough evidence on that what about you
sw04011-B_017392-017531 um-hum
sw04011-B_019876-020044 um-hum
sw04011-B_020044-020200 um-hum
sw04011-B_023268-024081 right and may be killed on the street anyway death is not that [laughter-big] [laughter-a] i mean [laughter-one] [laughter-way] or the other death is part of their everyday lives
sw04011-B_024081-024658 i mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed you know that's a big deal
sw04011-B_024658-025203 [vocalized-noise] but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up and walk to school
sw04011-B_025890-026012 yeah
sw04011-B_026398-026582 yes yeah
sw04011-B_026890-027061 yeah yeah
sw04011-B_027696-029041 that's right that that's right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to hand[le]- i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on [laughter] PBS the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about
sw04011-B_029041-029863 how wonderful our presidents have been because uh we've gotten this and that many more jails and [laughter]

sw04012-A_001300-001454 okay
sw04012-A_001454-001599 [noise]
sw04012-A_001704-001940 so what do you think about capital punishment
sw04012-A_002964-003137 uh-huh
sw04012-A_003753-003899 um-hum
sw04012-A_003899-004140 what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer
sw04012-A_004240-004543 like not getting since they don't have it in
sw04012-A_005421-005553 yeah
sw04012-A_006366-006495 yeah
sw04012-A_006495-007577 i know because_1 it's like it's kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowd[ed]- you know it's like problem upon problem upon problem
sw04012-A_007577-008019 it's like you could put them_1 in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded
sw04012-A_008019-008262 you know and they add more problems
sw04012-A_008262-008606 you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know
sw04012-A_008606-009180 time to like one third of what you're supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous
sw04012-A_010228-010379 yeah
sw04012-A_011115-011272 um-hum
sw04012-A_011467-012073 i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean
sw04012-A_012073-012848 i think i'm definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has
sw04012-A_012848-013862 no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know
sw04012-A_014899-015038 uh-huh
sw04012-A_015038-015159 right
sw04012-A_016041-016570 yeah see i think that [laughter] [vocalized-noise] what is the point of that
sw04012-A_016570-016935 [laughter] where did that come from
sw04012-A_018043-018180 yeah
sw04012-A_018712-018849 um-hum
sw04012-A_019309-019730 yeah that's true definitely true
sw04012-A_020508-020989 see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long
sw04012-A_021162-021300 see
sw04012-A_021848-022098 yeah i understand that
sw04012-A_022549-022898 it takes prolong it forever
sw04012-A_023223-023384 um-hum
sw04012-A_023783-023932 yeah
sw04012-A_024080-024242 [noise]
sw04012-A_024242-024407 yeah the the
sw04012-A_024549-024710 [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04012-A_024710-024851 see
sw04012-A_025200-025700 yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was
sw04012-A_025700-026608 you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know
sw04012-A_026608-027121 and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know
sw04012-A_027121-027337 i mean they should have like
sw04012-A_027337-027903 God there's something so it'd be done faster you know because_1 then they complain about the jails and the
sw04012-A_027903-028596 this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb
sw04012-A_028596-029191 m[ean]- mean at least if you're going to do it do it like because_1 i mean that's like even torture kind of you know
sw04012-A_029560-029725 yeah
sw04012-B_000000-000012 [noise]
sw04012-B_000012-000121 hi
sw04012-B_000121-000249 i'm Paul
sw04012-B_000249-000380 pleased to meet you
sw04012-B_000380-000549 i'm in Texas
sw04012-B_000659-000776 Dallas
sw04012-B_000885-001053 oh okay
sw04012-B_001207-001373 sure anytime
sw04012-B_001953-002313 well i think it's a necessary uh
sw04012-B_002313-003342 a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly
sw04012-B_003342-003821 uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent
sw04012-B_004478-004704 yeah well i think that
sw04012-B_004704-004948 i think there are certain
sw04012-B_004948-005438 [noise] people in society that have no redeeming
sw04012-B_005438-006238 uh worth to them and that it's i[t]- it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be
sw04012-B_006238-006421 you know disposed of
sw04012-B_007199-007331 that's right
sw04012-B_008920-009070 yeah
sw04012-B_009070-009352 that's right i mean they probably you know we
sw04012-B_009352-010581 the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed
sw04012-B_010581-011199 as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other
sw04012-B_013793-014209 well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is
sw04012-B_014321-014638 it whe[n]- when we administer it
sw04012-B_014638-015955 by you know i- i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting
sw04012-B_015955-016296 uh you know w[aiting]- w[aiting]- w[aiting]- waiting his sentence
sw04012-B_016296-016476 wh[at]- wh[at]-
sw04012-B_016476-016718 there there's no point in it i mean
sw04012-B_016862-017138 well it it's be[cause]- it's because
sw04012-B_017253-017588 you know people don't wanna recognize
sw04012-B_017588-018095 how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective
sw04012-B_018095-018264 i mean it
sw04012-B_018264-018732 punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good
sw04012-B_018732-019440 the only reas[on]- the only way it does some good is if it convi[nces]- convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that
sw04012-B_019648-020547 and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody
sw04012-B_020905-021158 because the courts require it
sw04012-B_021158-021931 i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have cer[tain]- you know has to have the the the right to appeal well
sw04012-B_021931-022719 but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate
sw04012-B_022820-023629 well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate
sw04012-B_023629-024648 technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong
sw04012-B_024777-025287 and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that
sw04012-B_026520-026739 yes that's right
sw04012-B_028101-028225 yes
sw04012-B_028349-028500 um-hum
sw04012-B_028500-028726 it is it's terrible
sw04012-B_029125-029863 oh i again i- i don't feel sorry for the for the for the victim that that's on you know for the for the criminal
sw04013-A_000000-000820 okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together

sw04013-A_014874-015874 um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one
sw04013-A_015977-016145 uh-huh
sw04013-A_016145-016237 [noise]
sw04013-A_016735-017012 uh-huh um-hum

sw04013-A_019545-019684 um-hum
sw04013-A_019871-021174 i think so and i feel like you know like President Bush Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home
sw04013-A_021174-021634 and so i i'm a firm believer in that too
sw04013-A_022049-022769 um yes that's that's true well we see that a lot out here in Utah and
sw04013-A_022769-023266 um so hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh that's a good
sw04013-A_023396-024180 [laughter] oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas or
sw04013-A_024180-024698 very few you feel like you're in the minority [laughter]

sw04013-A_026374-026551 oh
sw04013-A_026800-026965 oh
sw04013-A_026965-028111 oh i have some relatives out there in Texas in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and
sw04013-A_028111-028654 well uh no i'm trying Aberdeen
sw04013-A_028654-029914 it is that close to Dallas oh don't you it's i gue[ss]- guess it's out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and
sw04013-B_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04013-B_000802-001650 oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park
sw04013-B_001650-002424 um [noise] some time watching VCR movies
sw04013-B_002424-003197 um generally cheap [laughter-things] [laughter]
sw04013-B_003543-003709 that's right
sw04013-B_005367-005520 [noise]
sw04013-B_005739-005872 yeah
sw04013-B_007424-008452 most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them_1 are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa
sw04013-B_008452-008660 in Arizona
sw04013-B_008857-008987 yes
sw04013-B_009265-009907 oh we don't go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays
sw04013-B_009907-010241 and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us
sw04013-B_010489-010801 they range from twenty four to five
sw04013-B_011100-011510 that's right how old are your children
sw04013-B_011869-012533 i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac[tivities]- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together
sw04013-B_012533-013352 with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it
sw04013-B_013352-013697 and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and
sw04013-B_014508-014646 yeah
sw04013-B_015777-016065 i think it's improving actually
sw04013-B_016065-016988 we had an interesting experience the other day we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday and we just kind of keep them_1 at home
sw04013-B_016988-017648 and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there
sw04013-B_017648-018847 somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend [vocalized-noise] Saturday night at their house and she said no Sundays our family day [laughter] and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them
sw04013-B_018847-019617 and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction
sw04013-B_019617-019922 and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
sw04013-B_020246-020352 [noise]
sw04013-B_021138-021263 yeah
sw04013-B_021537-022198 i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something so

sw04013-B_024325-024449 yeah
sw04013-B_024449-025147 oh definitely when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense but uh
sw04013-B_025147-025448 [noise]
sw04013-B_025448-026211 average yeah my wife and i were in Utah until i guess we were about twenty four

sw04013-B_028031-028200 where where in Dallas
sw04013-B_028627-028750 hum
sw04013-B_028857-029199 i don't have any idea i've never heard of it must be a little town

sw04014-A_000000-000017 [noise]
sw04014-A_000017-000383 well i don't know how you feel about drug testing but i'm dead set against it
sw04014-A_000797-001318 [laughter]
sw04014-A_002214-002343 [laughter]
sw04014-A_002502-003907 yeah um i think about_1 the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or VIV war on rights is uh pretty much your Libertarian candidates which
sw04014-A_003907-004341 um i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get e[lected]- elected
sw04014-A_004459-004586 um-hum
sw04014-A_005816-005914 um-hum
sw04014-A_005914-006347 uh-huh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because um
sw04014-A_006347-007492 the um U S Department of Labor whatev[er]- i'm not sure might be a different agency requires um businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of the things it posts is
sw04014-A_007492-008338 um on the ille[gality]- illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are
sw04014-A_008455-009366 well it means that that that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that
sw04014-A_009366-010852 oh i mean i don['t]- i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being i don't understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous
sw04014-A_011003-011148 character
sw04014-A_011267-011395 um-hum
sw04014-A_012877-013015 um-hum [noise]
sw04014-A_013349-013473 oh yeah
sw04014-A_013798-013939 yeah
sw04014-A_014355-015806 yeah and and you know i i agree with with a lot of people that you know claim instead of [vocalized-noise] having random drug tests for continuing employment have um motor impairment tests um because you know the they they would not be any more pr[iced]- they would they would
sw04014-A_015806-016603 be similarly priced um and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before
sw04014-A_016603-017685 and you know he has that on his mind and isn't gonna be able to function properly you know i i just as you know i'd i'd almost as mu[ch]- you kn[ow]- have as much uh fear of him driving the bus i'm riding than
sw04014-A_017685-018402 yeah yeah or [laughter-maybe] [laughter-more] [laughter-yeah] [laughter] i'll show her
sw04014-A_018516-018663 um-hum
sw04014-A_018663-018837 um-hum
sw04014-A_018952-020289 um-hum and al[so]- and also on the question of you know just getting employment i'm you know i'm i'm a senior in college and i'm applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain um
sw04014-A_020289-021380 non uh sanctioned um hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is is just um moving away moving away from
sw04014-A_021380-022716 you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which uh you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and LSD which you know one they don't test for well LSD they don't test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week
sw04014-A_022716-023253 and i used [laughter-to] [laughter-snort] i just you know wonder what effect this is having you know
sw04014-A_023672-024424 um and i and i mean that's you know that's entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but
sw04014-A_024424-024795 i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is
sw04014-A_025170-025296 um-hum
sw04014-A_026037-026176 um-hum
sw04014-A_026821-026948 um-hum
sw04014-A_027422-027559 um-hum
sw04014-A_027873-028011 um-hum
sw04014-A_028443-028600 um-hum
sw04014-A_029007-029440 yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there there's
sw04014-B_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04014-B_000303-001756 well so we can have a conversation on on agreeing with one another today right [laughter-because] we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us
sw04014-B_001756-002581 change the the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with people's personal life
sw04014-B_004245-005138 well that's always a problem i have to admit that that back when uh the Texas governorship
sw04014-B_005138-006111 race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with Ann Richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue
sw04014-B_008137-008609 for self [decrimi/incrimination] self incrimination kind of thing yeah
sw04014-B_010888-011404 yeah yeah because the the tests are equally unreliable and
sw04014-B_011404-012720 personally i don't even think it's a question of whether they're reliable or not i mean it doesn't matter how reliable they are then i think that it's inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody who's
sw04014-B_012720-013678 getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are
sw04014-B_013678-014465 currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance
sw04014-B_015365-015501 okay
sw04014-B_017598-018225 [laughter] or maybe more [laughter] [laughter-well] you know if you stop and think about [laughter-it]
sw04014-B_018225-019015 stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well you're absolutely right
sw04014-B_019015-019248 you're absolutely right uh
sw04014-B_023235-023935 uh it certainly sounds that if if that's what college students are doing that that's anti productive
sw04014-B_024389-024510 yeah
sw04014-B_024837-025495 well that of course there's really there's really no way to know uh it's [vocalized-noise]
sw04014-B_025495-025959 i just you know unfortunately i've i've talked with a um
sw04014-B_025959-026653 some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husband's in a job situation that um
sw04014-B_026653-026842 makes him
sw04014-B_026842-027523 subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place
sw04014-B_027523-028560 and uh you know not that he does it not that he's ever done it you know i mean he's he's one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with
sw04014-B_028560-029145 you know with any of the rest of it he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control so he doesn't
sw04014-B_029250-029856 so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life
sw04015-A_000000-000060 [noise] i'm Bridget
sw04015-A_000248-000353 yes
sw04015-A_000353-000565 what are you doing
sw04015-A_000565-000761 i'm just sitting here trying to
sw04015-A_000761-001047 eat bread before i go to a meeting [laughter]
sw04015-A_001047-001266 no i'm in Lubbock
sw04015-A_001266-001586 yeah what are you doing are you at the office
sw04015-A_001586-001736 where are you
sw04015-A_001736-001849 are you
sw04015-A_001849-001969 cool
sw04015-A_001969-002264 i know like listen to us we're like trying to volunteer
sw04015-A_002264-002477 okay are you ready for me to push one
sw04015-A_002477-002625 do we know what we're going to say
sw04015-A_002728-002951 yeah okay i'll push one
sw04015-A_003055-003180 [noise]
sw04015-A_003180-003498 okay so what do you think about crime in the big D
sw04015-A_003822-003948 are you
sw04015-A_004466-004588 um-hum
sw04015-A_004700-005971 i don't know i think in Dallas it's a lot more scary just because_1 it's a big city i mean in Lubbock and stuff i know lots of people that don't lock their doors or you know leave their windows open at night because it's so much smaller i mean it feels safer
sw04015-A_005971-006423 and i know that it happens here but it's not near like it is in Dallas
sw04015-A_006566-006766 people are more trustworthy i think
sw04015-A_006766-006977 people have reason to be i guess
sw04015-A_007312-007445 yeah
sw04015-A_007445-007913 i know lots of people that'll leave their doors open you know if you have to go get something like
sw04015-A_007913-008218 get a book or something from their house you can just walk right in
sw04015-A_008218-008463 they're always unlocked or something and
sw04015-A_008564-008635 i mean
sw04015-A_008751-009056 see i know and there're only like certain
sw04015-A_009056-009618 you know neighborhoods up in Lubbock that are that you wouldn't leave your doors unlock[ed]- you know
sw04015-A_009618-010022 but besides that i don't know it's fairly safe i think
sw04015-A_010305-010389 really
sw04015-A_010478-010591 yeah
sw04015-A_010591-010687 yeah
sw04015-A_010797-010999 Dallas can be pretty bad though
sw04015-A_010999-011217 i think it depend on the city really
sw04015-A_011330-011619 i don't know though because i think that way of Lubbock and then uh
sw04015-A_011619-012304 like i was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country and she was saying how bad it is out there and i would think it would be less
sw04015-A_012304-012527 i would thinking it wouldn't be as bad
sw04015-A_013272-013563 see i know i know that's scary
sw04015-A_013738-014167 i don't know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what
sw04015-A_014167-015252 i was like no way and she goes yeah she goes you know people get broken into a lot because they you know it's real easy to get away with there you know no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby
sw04015-A_015252-015517 i was like well that's true but besides that
sw04015-A_015517-015796 i don't know and i think it's just getting worse
sw04015-A_016206-016314 uh-huh
sw04015-A_016719-016874 i know
sw04015-A_017069-017199 see i know
sw04015-A_018059-018230 yeah that's true
sw04015-A_018230-018499 because_1 you have neighbors and stuff at least you know
sw04015-A_018639-018865 i know someone's got to
sw04015-A_018865-019051 i know that's scary though
sw04015-A_019051-019262 and it just keeps rising
sw04015-A_019262-019455 i mean i can't imagine
sw04015-A_019455-020046 i don't know what's after i've been here so long it's like i well you'd have to pay me to move back to Dallas
sw04015-A_020194-020446 i mean i don't like n[ow]- now that
sw04015-A_020446-021049 i'm away from it and i can look back at how you know Dallas is and stuff yeah i don't like it
sw04015-A_021049-021289 i don't like it at all really
sw04015-A_021289-021551 i don't know i think it'd depend on
sw04015-A_021551-022038 i don't know where you live i know that's not right though i think that but i don't think that's really
sw04015-A_022655-022779 yeah
sw04015-A_022889-022983 yeah
sw04015-A_024166-024712 really see that's sad i would think like car theft is a really big thing
sw04015-A_024712-024878 wouldn't you
sw04015-A_024878-025003 i think that or
sw04015-A_025157-025362 i know i know
sw04015-A_025572-025728 see i know
sw04015-A_025728-025911 i don't know because_1 that's
sw04015-A_025911-026398 i think ca[r]- i don't know if that is though that's what that'd be my guess car theft for sure

sw04016-B_007354-008164 you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just uh we have a different terrain [laughter-here] so
sw04016-B_008164-008289 uh
sw04016-B_008648-008795 um-hum
sw04016-B_008980-009348 it's flat [laughter]
sw04016-B_009348-010479 yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to to find any there are some as a matter of fact but um what other things do the kids like to do
sw04016-B_010621-011203 like weekends or during during during the winter do they ski or
sw04016-B_011390-011633 it is expensive yeah
sw04016-B_011733-011878 yeah
sw04016-B_012232-012410 um-hum
sw04016-B_012410-012529 hm
sw04016-B_012529-012728 yeah that's fun
sw04016-B_013572-013773 yes that's
sw04016-B_014121-014310 um-hum
sw04016-B_014310-014503 um-hum
sw04016-B_015044-015496 [laughter] all of those things yeah
sw04016-B_015496-016541 well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in in their minds in at any rate yeah
sw04016-B_016917-017099 well that's good
sw04016-B_017269-017419 uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
sw04016-B_017419-018492 [laughter] your first experience with it well it um it's interesting [laughter] there's a dramatic change at thirteen and it doesn't end -[un]til about twenty five but
sw04016-B_018492-019245 [laughter] it's part of what's supposed to happen or they can't fly the nest so um tha[t's]- that's one way of looking at it
sw04016-B_019245-020474 [laughter] anyway i was trying to think what what what we spent a lot of time well reading i loved to read to the kids when they were when they were younger uh obviously not any more but
sw04016-B_020474-020817 and uh we still we
sw04016-B_020817-021898 like um Disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and um
sw04016-B_021898-022848 ironically uh my twenty sev[en]- my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for Christmas we rented um Jungle Book you know
sw04016-B_022848-023509 and uh i gave one of them Jungle Book and one of them Fantasia for Christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts [laughter-so]
sw04016-B_023509-024898 [laughter] so that's something um besides the [noise] another thing we used to do is watch PBS together which there were a lot of um my son loves science programs and um
sw04016-B_024898-025505 we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on
sw04016-B_025505-026018 yeah which was which was fun yeah and so
sw04016-B_026207-027561 yeah we did and um and we enjoyed that um my now we my kids back when they were y[ounger]- younger got did we would go from here to like Colorado and ski
sw04016-B_027561-027969 and they did both uh learn to be scuba divers
sw04016-B_027969-028361 uh we went once on a vacation with my parents
sw04016-B_028361-029730 to an island and they snorkeled and that that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of Missouri as we were living in Kansas City then
sw04016-B_029730-030048 and uh went and i don't can't remember what it's called uh but it's
sw04017-A_000000-000449 [noise] uh well it's nice to talk with you um
sw04017-A_000449-001433 oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to [noise] uh
sw04017-A_001433-002169 to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um
sw04017-A_002169-002691 uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress
sw04017-A_002691-003730 uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the
sw04017-A_003730-004046 the willpower on their own to uh
sw04017-A_004046-005034 to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh
sw04017-A_005034-005751 i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district
sw04017-A_007202-007411 yeah that's exactly right
sw04017-A_007411-007561 [noise]
sw04017-A_007763-009019 yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh
sw04017-A_009019-009419 uh uh you wouldn't be able to um
sw04017-A_009419-010402 put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that
sw04017-A_010402-010783 and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute
sw04017-A_010783-011225 and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen
sw04017-A_011225-011466 uh because no one
sw04017-A_011466-011653 uh
sw04017-A_011653-012703 uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing
sw04017-A_017174-017343 i agree
sw04017-A_018212-018343 um-hum
sw04017-A_019090-020264 yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh [laughter]
sw04017-A_020264-021194 and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh w[e]-
sw04017-A_021194-022087 gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending
sw04017-A_024405-024740 and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy
sw04017-A_025118-026008 how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves
sw04017-A_026490-026588 yeah
sw04017-A_027330-027956 well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas
sw04017-A_028731-028868 that's right
sw04017-A_029033-029158 um-hum
sw04017-A_029158-029831 yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid
sw04017-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04017-B_002047-002243 i agree with that [laughter]
sw04017-B_005438-005699 local politics yeah
sw04017-B_005699-006733 well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together
sw04017-B_006733-007792 uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the l[ine]- yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to
sw04017-B_008561-008623 [laughter]
sw04017-B_010501-010635 yeah
sw04017-B_011793-011899 yeah
sw04017-B_012099-012193 yeah
sw04017-B_012636-013749 there's another i[dea]- uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects
sw04017-B_013749-015039 too often uh those are uh not there's no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with
sw04017-B_015039-015264 billions of dollars of overlay
sw04017-B_015264-016130 or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be
sw04017-B_016130-017180 for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way
sw04017-B_017180-018272 and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh what's being uh spent and more accountability that would help enor[mous]- enormously too are
sw04017-B_018272-019135 how who or how that would come about i'm not uh sure but that's an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at
sw04017-B_022019-022500 well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs
sw04017-B_022500-023203 uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the [noise] the military's a big uh
sw04017-B_023203-024018 area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i- i do not see the point of having four different services
sw04017-B_024018-024473 uh i do not see why they could not have one military service
sw04017-B_024645-025196 that's right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments
sw04017-B_025998-026173 uh
sw04017-B_026273-026546 basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that
sw04017-B_026546-027308 uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh
sw04017-B_027308-027696 or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a
sw04017-B_027802-028796 no well wit[ness]- witness the the recent Gulf War too even with uh troops all over Europe uh it took several months to gear up
sw04017-B_028796-029104 and so what was the point of having them to begin with
sw04018-A_000000-000064 [noise]

sw04018-A_020452-020623 yeah
sw04018-A_021160-021280 um-hum
sw04018-A_022444-022621 um-hum
sw04018-A_022621-022834 that's great
sw04018-A_023407-023548 yeah
sw04018-A_024204-024392 yeah really
sw04018-A_024769-024949 really
sw04018-A_024949-025619 we w[e]- i know uh even before this took place um in September
sw04018-A_025619-026827 the our like our boy scouts were doing pa[per]- you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so
sw04018-A_026827-028209 i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the Dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago i'm not sure
sw04018-A_028209-028578 but i know now i m[ean]- we have a lot of um
sw04018-A_028682-029856 stores [vocalized-noise] Wal-Mart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of compa[nies]-
sw04018-B_000000-000056 [noise]
sw04018-B_000563-001182 we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going
sw04018-B_001182-002470 the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic
sw04018-B_002470-003179 but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet
sw04018-B_007372-007945 here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more
sw04018-B_007945-008799 we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but
sw04018-B_008799-009626 i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they
sw04018-B_009626-010644 you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular
sw04018-B_010644-011189 well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand
sw04018-B_011189-011934 but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving
sw04018-B_015020-015638 um di[d]- di[d]- did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers
sw04018-B_016968-017677 boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans
sw04018-B_017677-018412 uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side
sw04018-B_019793-020274 yeah it really is but there are a few people who who
sw04018-B_020274-021223 they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church
sw04018-B_021223-021742 and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then
sw04018-B_021742-022712 uh take them_1 to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food
sw04018-B_022712-023526 and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church
sw04018-B_023526-024121 but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling
sw04018-B_024121-025097 places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them_1 so we're stuck with newspapers
sw04019-A_000000-000408 [noise] okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home
sw04019-A_000408-000598 and what kind do you have

sw04019-A_013340-013896 [laughter] were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house [laughter]

sw04020-A_000034-000513 i pre[ssed]- i pressed one all right uh on uh
sw04020-A_000513-001098 benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation
sw04020-A_001098-001989 i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh there's a little more in backup when i need it
sw04020-A_001989-002264 do you work outside of the home
sw04020-A_002452-002575 oh
sw04020-A_002575-002831 that's a pretty large corporation
sw04020-A_003162-003306 um-hum
sw04020-A_003645-003787 [no/oh] yeah
sw04020-A_004295-004763 yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around
sw04020-A_004763-004948 um-hum
sw04020-A_005352-005937 yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one

sw04020-A_007141-008303 well i think uh course i'm i'm a medical technologist and and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find
sw04020-A_008303-009227 because_1 um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh
sw04020-A_009227-009784 of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations
sw04020-A_009784-010212 do you have good resources in your school district
sw04020-A_010566-011028 yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place
sw04020-A_011028-011473 um is how about you how do you feel about that
sw04020-A_012754-012889 um-hum

sw04020-A_016359-016629 yeah well ours is
sw04020-A_017076-017338 well it's it's difficult [laughter]
sw04020-A_017338-018159 i know uh ours has improved over what it was because_1 we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but
sw04020-A_018159-018837 the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost [laughter-pathetic]
sw04020-A_018837-019127 so that's how i'd like to improve ours
sw04020-A_019996-020234 oh well you have to
sw04020-A_020234-020518 uh-huh you have to if you're smart

sw04020-A_021777-021908 um-hum
sw04020-A_022075-022951 well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and
sw04020-A_022951-023253 yeah and that's that's kind of rough
sw04020-A_023253-023396 [vocalized-noise]
sw04020-A_023911-024080 um-hum
sw04020-A_024189-024346 um-hum

sw04020-A_025216-025532 yeah it happens
sw04020-A_025815-026439 yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise
sw04020-A_026592-026734 um-hum
sw04020-A_027251-028242 i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire
sw04020-A_028242-028738 because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it
sw04020-A_028738-028974 yeah it was uh
sw04020-A_028974-029450 it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess

sw04021-B_026166-026442 oh man everytime we

sw04021-B_027165-027550 it's a high volume low pressure they're new sprayers that are coming out
sw04021-B_027550-027753 really little over spray
sw04021-B_027892-028242 it's air it only sprays with three PSI
sw04021-B_028242-028803 but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that's what
sw04021-B_028803-029097 that's what gives you your thrust of your paint
sw04021-B_029199-029431 um do you do [vocalized-noise]
sw04021-B_029431-029640 it was five hundred bucks [noise]
sw04021-B_029640-029741 [laughter]
sw04022-A_000000-000026 [noise]
sw04022-A_000026-000740 well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh
sw04022-A_000740-001310 there ought to be so[me]- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
sw04022-A_001765-001922 right
sw04022-A_001922-002756 right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering
sw04022-A_002756-003868 yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that
sw04022-A_004323-004482 yeah
sw04022-A_004749-005204 nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either uh
sw04022-A_005204-006527 i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could
sw04022-A_006527-006924 do something to affect our budget at this point
sw04022-A_007624-008072 i believe it was Dukakis but i i can't
sw04022-A_008072-009452 yeah i mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh
sw04022-A_009452-010840 that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know whe[re]- where that money is actually gonna go because
sw04022-A_010840-011331 in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend
sw04022-A_011331-012709 i mean if they could actually pu[t]- put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because_1 i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works
sw04022-A_012709-012970 projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
sw04022-A_013191-013361 right ex[actly]-
sw04022-A_013462-014056 exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infra[structure]- structure of the country
sw04022-A_014346-015577 yeah and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
sw04022-A_015923-016197 [laughter]
sw04022-A_016798-016953 so am i

sw04022-A_022650-023023 you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington
sw04022-A_023143-024163 yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
sw04022-A_025554-025713 oh no
sw04022-A_025990-026126 uh-huh
sw04022-A_026572-027750 for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again
sw04022-A_027750-028364 and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference

sw04022-B_003816-004455 hell i mean mostly you know it's it's not actually a a a cut it's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know

sw04022-B_017070-017800 right i go to Georgia Tech um and in my i had poli[tical]- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago
sw04022-B_017800-019144 and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situa[tion]- how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eigh[ty]- in the um tax year of eighty one um
sw04022-B_019144-019458 Ronald Reagan basically said you know
sw04022-B_019458-020159 i'm gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um
sw04022-B_020159-021558 that the Congress would not in the right mind pass and Con[gress]- Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the Democratic Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know sli[cing]- by by removing the tax cut
sw04022-B_021558-022476 further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know wha[t]- created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
sw04022-B_022476-022875 and you just [noise] i mean it's just
sw04022-B_022875-023244 i mean it's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun
sw04022-B_023516-023647 yeah
sw04022-B_023969-024912 um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes
sw04022-B_024912-025640 and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
sw04022-B_025640-026325 i mean it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have
sw04022-B_026325-026697 you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and
sw04022-B_026697-026802 [laughter]

sw04022-B_028899-029373 i don't i don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with [laughter-ninety] [laughter-seven] [laughter-cents] a week
sw04022-B_029508-029917 well i just don't think it was a well thought out [laughter-incentive]
sw04023-A_000000-000040 [noise]
sw04023-A_000040-000431 so Martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said you're from Atlanta
sw04023-A_000557-000686 um-hum
sw04023-A_001171-001294 um-hum
sw04023-A_001294-001644 i mean do you f[ind]- do you find crime in Atlanta really bad i mean i live in Atlanta also
sw04023-A_001644-001783 uh-huh
sw04023-A_002823-002914 um-hum
sw04023-A_003262-003383 um-hum
sw04023-A_003383-003687 well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
sw04023-A_004893-004988 um-hum
sw04023-A_005956-006127 i'd probably agree with that
sw04023-A_006296-006413 uh
sw04023-A_007022-007143 um-hum
sw04023-A_007853-008144 yeah that's probably true um
sw04023-A_008364-008800 so d[o]- um well do you think Atlanta is as bad as most other cities
sw04023-A_010099-010220 um-hum
sw04023-A_010426-010721 um-hum i don't think it's as bad as LA either
sw04023-A_010721-011226 we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
sw04023-A_011702-011829 um-hum
sw04023-A_012254-012384 um-hum
sw04023-A_012541-012648 yeah
sw04023-A_012648-013914 i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you kn[ow]- trying not to look like a victim
sw04023-A_013914-014041 you know
sw04023-A_014162-014475 you know walk wi[th]- you know walk with you know with
sw04023-A_014475-015447 well [laughter] not silly just walk you know confidently and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
sw04023-A_015555-015704 [laughter-yeah]
sw04023-A_015870-015991 um-hum
sw04023-A_016156-016279 um-hum
sw04023-A_016509-016633 yeah
sw04023-A_016737-017004 and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta
sw04023-A_017333-017458 um-hum
sw04023-A_018228-018350 um-hum
sw04023-A_018724-018849 um-hum
sw04023-A_019045-019166 um-hum
sw04023-A_019351-019789 yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't
sw04023-A_019789-020331 yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
sw04023-A_020331-021368 and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in Atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
sw04023-A_021739-021864 oh really
sw04023-A_021998-022298 wow where was where where was that was that downtown or
sw04023-A_022556-022682 really
sw04023-A_022784-022991 um-hum metropolitan yeah
sw04023-A_023262-023665 yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen
sw04023-A_023665-023828 um
sw04023-A_023828-024149 and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to
sw04023-A_024149-025003 the APD seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair [laughter] up on blocks you know my friend who had a um
sw04023-A_025003-025656 VW Rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat [laughter]
sw04023-A_026342-026464 um-hum
sw04023-A_026589-026782 well you're probably luckier than
sw04023-A_026927-027053 um-hum
sw04023-A_027053-027193 um
sw04023-A_027193-027591 so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body

sw04023-A_029691-029856 [laughter]
sw04023-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04023-B_000342-001003 right i- i- i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh
sw04023-B_001003-001207 you know for my own safety
sw04023-B_001565-001750 oh that's right um
sw04023-B_001853-002406 uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in it's not
sw04023-B_002406-003410 uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's ce[rtain]- certain areas where uh the crime is focused um
sw04023-B_003730-004917 well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility
sw04023-B_004917-005344 and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount
sw04023-B_005344-005543 and probably um
sw04023-B_005543-006101 they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is
sw04023-B_006101-006243 yeah
sw04023-B_006243-006624 you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects
sw04023-B_006624-007704 uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
sw04023-B_008824-009394 um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top
sw04023-B_009394-009660 top ten in terms of crime
sw04023-B_009660-009804 um
sw04023-B_009804-010499 it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example probably not not as bad as Detroit
sw04023-B_010625-010771 no
sw04023-B_011154-011721 yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like New York City and
sw04023-B_011721-012482 you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious
sw04023-B_013978-014159 yeah that's true
sw04023-B_014347-014620 with a big stick or
sw04023-B_014620-014763 [laughter]
sw04023-B_015013-015117 right
sw04023-B_015219-016409 sure [vocalized-noise] right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that um and and then you're kind of
sw04023-B_016409-016648 on your own [laughter]
sw04023-B_016977-017363 uh no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted

sw04023-B_017626-018778 a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got [vocalized-noise] i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really
sw04023-B_018778-019133 and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
sw04023-B_019133-019426 i've had that happen but that's that's about it

sw04025-B_015345-015503 right
sw04025-B_015763-016576 i know on more of a smaller scale my husband's mother and father have {boughten} a condominium that's in a ski resort in Utah
sw04025-B_016576-017230 and um they have it a certain week each year that's set aside for the whole family to come home
sw04025-B_017230-018221 in July and um everybody tries to go there and stay it's two or three big condominiums that all hook together and so everybody tries to go up and stay and

sw04025-B_020625-020753 right

sw04025-B_028790-029000 the money yeah
sw04025-B_029467-029611 right
sw04026-A_000000-000232 [noise] oh how's your products been [noise]
sw04026-A_001060-001543 [laughter] i hear that one have you had any lately go out
sw04026-A_003226-003388 oh wow
sw04026-A_003521-004014 so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
sw04026-A_004014-004896 [laughter]
sw04026-A_004896-005510 [laughter-you're] [laughter-kidding] yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
sw04026-A_005624-005796 [laughter-yeah]
sw04026-A_005796-006486 [vocalized-noise] the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and
sw04026-A_006486-006871 i bought this paint stripper where they advertise [noise]
sw04026-A_006871-007314 that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product
sw04026-A_007314-007691 it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
sw04026-A_007691-008217 i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it
sw04026-A_008217-008722 but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
sw04026-A_009556-009723 that's incredib[le]-
sw04026-A_010562-010729 [laughter]
sw04026-A_011331-011565 and they all went out at the same time
sw04026-A_011565-011727 or two days
sw04026-A_011727-011858 wow
sw04026-A_012107-012281 [laughter]
sw04026-A_014408-014618 wow that's frustrating
sw04026-A_015053-015232 [laughter]
sw04026-A_015553-015682 uh-huh
sw04026-A_016803-017007 uh-huh they go out a lot
sw04026-A_018721-019418 yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i -[j]ust home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
sw04026-A_019418-019548 yeah
sw04026-A_019548-019802 at Morton International and
sw04026-A_019802-020384 i thin[k]- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything
sw04026-A_020384-020630 after each assembly process
sw04026-A_020630-020967 and so our testing is pretty thorough but
sw04026-A_021277-021415 um
sw04026-A_022108-022523 um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't
sw04026-A_022523-023084 i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag
sw04026-A_023084-024243 and but we do test after during the assembly proj[ect]- product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there
sw04026-A_024243-024973 after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
sw04026-A_024973-025433 and then we do electrical tests on them_1 during the process so
sw04026-A_026368-026552 [laughter]
sw04026-A_026552-026643 yeah
sw04026-A_027349-027739 well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
sw04026-A_027739-028075 it's incredible how much testing they have to do
sw04026-A_028683-028814 uh-huh
sw04026-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04026-B_000208-000850 um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy
sw04026-B_000850-001185 goes bad just after the warranty runs out
sw04026-B_001444-001997 yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave
sw04026-B_001997-002832 all three and they unfortunately i bought them_1 all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh
sw04026-B_002832-003349 i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them_1 all repaired and that
sw04026-B_003349-003595 yeah it was a hassle [noise]
sw04026-B_003883-004611 yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the i[ce]- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself
sw04026-B_004611-005028 lasted three years and it was three years and two months
sw04026-B_005028-005197 no
sw04026-B_005522-005728 uh watch out
sw04026-B_006298-006431 um-hum
sw04026-B_007615-007734 hm
sw04026-B_008707-009067 i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
sw04026-B_009067-009602 i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
sw04026-B_009602-010093 the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh
sw04026-B_010194-010777 microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh
sw04026-B_010777-011354 the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them_1
sw04026-B_011516-011789 uh within two days of each other
sw04026-B_011789-011929 i was
sw04026-B_011929-012210 it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
sw04026-B_012210-012715 and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so
sw04026-B_012715-013074 even if uh i think even if i had uh
sw04026-B_013074-013399 had kept the warranty the service agreements were
sw04026-B_013399-013861 with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that
sw04026-B_013861-014449 retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not
sw04026-B_014558-014921 but i didn't have to worry about all that because
sw04026-B_014921-015126 they weren't under warranty
sw04026-B_015126-015285 so
sw04026-B_015285-015592 it was a call to the local appliance dealer
sw04026-B_015702-015945 who came out and fixed them_1 all but
sw04026-B_015945-016374 i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um
sw04026-B_016374-016895 i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
sw04026-B_016895-017463 yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and
sw04026-B_017463-017796 the other two weren't but i just
sw04026-B_017796-018085 other than that you know TVs and
sw04026-B_018085-018791 things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
sw04026-B_019345-019637 oh really that's interesting
sw04026-B_020963-021465 do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
sw04026-B_021465-022162 like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
sw04026-B_023019-023152 um-hum
sw04026-B_025374-026125 well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
sw04026-B_026125-026481 luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
sw04026-B_026481-026810 but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm
sw04026-B_026810-027235 seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to
sw04026-B_027235-027448 to come about but that
sw04026-B_027996-028741 oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
sw04026-B_028741-029274 if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
sw04026-B_029274-029847 it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
sw04027-A_000000-000118 [noise]
sw04027-A_001344-001900 well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman
sw04027-A_002057-002462 yeah well no no he actually wasn't he he's an uh he was uh
sw04027-A_002573-003276 [noise] he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe
sw04027-A_003276-003951 uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh
sw04027-A_003951-004845 and i'm a M[ilton]- kind of a Milton Friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um
sw04027-A_004845-004944 [noise]
sw04027-A_005058-006179 that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a CPA and i c[an]- i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh
sw04027-A_006179-006606 in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they
sw04027-A_006606-006769 take money from them_1
sw04027-A_006871-007193 [vocalized-noise] you bet i do yep
sw04027-A_007193-007846 [noise] something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i'd i can't believe how
sw04027-A_007846-008589 ta[x]- y[ou]- you know [vocalized-noise] our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how
sw04027-A_008589-009256 tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue
sw04027-A_009501-009601 uh-huh
sw04027-A_009802-009900 uh-huh
sw04027-A_010785-010927 th[at's]- that's [laughter-right]
sw04027-A_010927-011052 [noise]

sw04027-A_011406-011499 [noise]
sw04027-A_011694-011800 [laughter-right]
sw04027-A_011800-012452 the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right
sw04027-A_012452-013150 but for every man woman and child in the United States they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece
sw04027-A_013150-013686 i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
sw04027-A_013686-013900 i'd be done i'd be sunk
sw04027-A_013900-014374 you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt
sw04027-A_014374-015293 i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the Soviet Union did
sw04027-A_015293-015740 or uh i i don't know how how how can we
sw04027-A_015855-016255 yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh
sw04027-A_016462-017373 [laughter-yeah] because we write off [laughter-debts] we loaned the Mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them
sw04027-A_017373-018170 that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was Turkey We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian Gulf
sw04027-A_018170-018743 so we just went over there and said gee guys uh you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it
sw04027-A_018743-018927 that's ridiculous
sw04027-A_018927-019999 and uh and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other f[rom]- from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise me
sw04027-A_020899-021036 [noise]
sw04027-A_021036-021882 what do you think about the Japanese and the comments they've made recently about the American people i'm not sure that's [vocalized-noise] actually a political issue but uh
sw04027-A_022806-023070 [laughter] [laughter-that's] true
sw04027-A_023070-023316 and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong

sw04027-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04027-B_000260-001400 um [noise] so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual [vocalized-noise] uh lives
sw04027-B_001841-002143 um yeah he's a commentator isn't he
sw04027-B_002813-002941 uh-huh
sw04027-B_003210-003330 uh-huh
sw04027-B_004159-004250 uh-huh
sw04027-B_005094-005200 uh-huh
sw04027-B_005415-005534 uh-huh
sw04027-B_006560-006947 [noise] and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view
sw04027-B_006947-007107 [noise]
sw04027-B_007107-007201 uh-huh
sw04027-B_007550-007696 uh-huh
sw04027-B_008221-008330 uh-huh
sw04027-B_009141-009528 yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point
sw04027-B_009528-009838 i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned
sw04027-B_009838-010421 you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you know have this bread and circuses policy of
sw04027-B_010421-010754 you know w[e'll]- we'll give you a dollar a day if you vote for us [vocalized-noise]
sw04027-B_010855-011325 [laughter-yeah] yeah i mean your kids won't be happy but [laughter]

sw04027-B_013859-013984 uh-huh
sw04027-B_015346-015450 [noise]
sw04027-B_015590-015942 it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years
sw04027-B_015942-016085 um
sw04027-B_016085-016521 and we we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world
sw04027-B_016521-016700 supposedly
sw04027-B_017331-017451 uh-huh
sw04027-B_018138-018246 uh-huh
sw04027-B_018696-018841 uh-huh
sw04027-B_018841-018986 uh-huh
sw04027-B_020035-020207 yeah maybe i would [noise]
sw04027-B_020330-020698 we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
sw04027-B_020799-021058 i uh um
sw04027-B_021874-022227 well it in it um
sw04027-B_022227-022955 i think if anyone but the Japanese had made it if [vocalized-noise] if an American had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them [laughter]
sw04027-B_022955-023095 [noise]
sw04027-B_023206-023458 oh yeah yeah yeah [noise]
sw04027-B_023458-023620 um
sw04027-B_023620-024163 you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy
sw04027-B_024163-024502 um in management um
sw04027-B_024502-024701 you know our
sw04027-B_024701-024950 we you know we we you know [vocalized-noise]
sw04027-B_024950-025430 you know the trend of of over consumption since World War Two um
sw04027-B_025430-026613 you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy [vocalized-noise] thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that you know [vocalized-noise] just moved for better and better standards of living
sw04027-B_026613-027093 and where a bunch of other factors i think you know [vocalized-noise] is just
sw04027-B_027093-027632 you know [vocalized-noise] it's [vocalized-noise] it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that
sw04027-B_027632-028144 you know when when you know when when you combine with the with the mismanagement that a lot of American companies have had
sw04027-B_028144-028706 and yeah i think that you know that's [vocalized-noise] when he says that they were la[zy]- i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use
sw04027-B_028706-029800 but i think you know you know un[willing]- [vocalized-noise] unwilling you know un[willing]- the American workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are
sw04028-A_000000-000945 [noise] okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
sw04028-A_001399-001517 uh-huh
sw04028-A_001884-002012 um-hum
sw04028-A_002012-002521 well um does your company have good benefits in that [noise] in that regard
sw04028-A_002897-003014 uh-huh
sw04028-A_004448-004567 oh yeah
sw04028-A_004866-004996 um-hum
sw04028-A_006389-006494 hm
sw04028-A_006729-006836 i see
sw04028-A_006836-007450 uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an HMO um so
sw04028-A_007450-008402 that's in my opinion that's gett[ing]- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um
sw04028-A_010065-010206 um-hum
sw04028-A_010974-011107 right
sw04028-A_012606-012731 yes
sw04028-A_012731-013095 that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been
sw04028-A_013095-013619 when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
sw04028-A_013619-014025 and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really
sw04028-A_014025-014694 so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me it's worked out real good
sw04028-A_016146-016273 um-hum
sw04028-A_017122-017235 hm
sw04028-A_017512-017631 um-hum
sw04028-A_017631-018427 yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess
sw04028-A_018427-019342 another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit
sw04028-A_019547-020086 right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
sw04028-A_021310-021450 um-hum
sw04028-A_022791-022906 um-hum
sw04028-A_023080-023300 [laughter] right
sw04028-A_023482-024313 well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with
sw04028-A_024313-024419 um
sw04028-A_024419-025227 and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
sw04028-A_026236-026366 right
sw04028-A_026609-026733 right
sw04028-A_027732-027851 um-hum
sw04028-A_028245-028366 oh yeah
sw04028-A_028760-028893 um-hum
sw04028-A_029277-029414 okay_1 are there
sw04028-A_029414-029840 [noise] are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benef[its]-
sw04028-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04028-B_000911-001541 uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh
sw04028-B_001541-001927 covering medical costs for yourself or family members
sw04028-B_002469-003380 yeah i thin[k]- i work for a a public school system district and uh [noise] so it's different than a company where
sw04028-B_003380-003881 most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um
sw04028-B_003881-004098 the employee must pick up
sw04028-B_004098-005156 a greater figure in the way of uh costs but i[t]- overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration
sw04028-B_005156-005450 is because of the cost of insurance
sw04028-B_005450-006537 going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
sw04028-B_006537-006912 it has not disturbed me any how about_1 yourself
sw04028-B_007227-007362 uh-huh
sw04028-B_008254-008511 right yeah our district did that
sw04028-B_008511-009339 for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um
sw04028-B_009443-010300 i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um
sw04028-B_010300-010404 uh
sw04028-B_010404-011445 i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i- i have to say it really works but again
sw04028-B_011445-012395 i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join
sw04028-B_012395-012826 it can be very stressful for you know those people
sw04028-B_013557-013679 uh-huh
sw04028-B_014411-014554 yeah
sw04028-B_014554-014979 right but if you you know have a family and and um
sw04028-B_014979-015526 everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel
sw04028-B_015526-016476 knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and
sw04028-B_016476-017424 my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as
sw04028-B_017424-017658 you know good so [noise]
sw04028-B_017658-017771 uh
sw04028-B_018132-018286 oh all right

sw04028-B_020254-020448 [noise] i don't think
sw04028-B_020448-021059 most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but
sw04028-B_021059-021565 i don't think the teachers could stand the stress [laughter-all] all year long frankly it is just
sw04028-B_021565-021757 Texas has really um
sw04028-B_021757-021857 [noise]
sw04028-B_021857-022448 you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just

sw04028-B_024209-024418 okay i li[ke]-
sw04028-B_025202-025557 well that's good yeah i would think that that type of
sw04028-B_025557-025773 employment you're you're
sw04028-B_025773-026419 one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um
sw04028-B_026419-026662 you know it's good that they allow you that
sw04028-B_026662-027250 it um a[s]- i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get
sw04028-B_027250-027563 many days off and um
sw04028-B_027563-028390 we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time
sw04028-B_028390-029015 i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just
sw04028-B_029015-029326 continued to uh stay there

sw04029-A_007427-007529 yeah
sw04029-A_008280-008435 something like that
sw04029-A_008544-008636 oh
sw04029-A_008636-009221 do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or
sw04029-A_010032-010199 [laughter]
sw04029-A_012369-012513 [laughter]

sw04029-A_012826-013295 well mine mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now
sw04029-A_013295-013457 [noise]
sw04029-A_013655-013980 i found a technician who works at TI
sw04029-A_013980-014249 and [laughter-does] things like that in his spare time
sw04029-A_014660-014752 oh yeah
sw04029-A_014752-014855 yeah
sw04029-A_014855-015463 but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home
sw04029-A_017349-017456 yeah
sw04029-A_017557-017775 yeah i've done a lot of that
sw04029-A_017775-018263 and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or
sw04029-A_018263-018672 have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it
sw04029-A_018672-018876 what else do you need [laughter-right]
sw04029-A_019124-019360 well that's probably true
sw04029-A_019360-019512 [laughter]
sw04029-A_019512-019596 [noise]
sw04029-A_020000-020090 [laughter]

sw04029-A_021325-021527 just standard card solitaire
sw04029-A_021527-022832 but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and [laughter]
sw04029-A_023077-023499 i ju[st]- i just happened to stumble across that of course i don't play games at work right [laughter]
sw04029-A_024397-024504 uh-huh
sw04029-A_026348-026497 that's right [laughter]
sw04029-A_026497-026839 [laughter] i was going to say you must have a printer then
sw04029-A_026839-026916 [laughter]
sw04029-A_027447-027551 uh-huh
sw04029-B_000240-000738 uh we still have an old uh Texas Instruments
sw04029-B_000738-000926 Professional Computer
sw04029-B_000926-002065 back in the days when TI was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the IBM i don't remember what those were the ATs or something like that or
sw04029-B_002212-003241 [laughter] way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it [laughter-unfortunately] so we just sort of stumble on using
sw04029-B_003241-003534 the same stuff that we always have
sw04029-B_003728-004654 um well i used to i have a Master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about
sw04029-B_004654-005076 six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
sw04029-B_005076-005908 so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
sw04029-B_005908-006241 creative writing without having to have uh
sw04029-B_006241-006595 uh the mechanics of
sw04029-B_006701-007063 handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
sw04029-B_007063-007637 he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the [laughter-keyboard] i have to admit i'd like a
sw04029-B_007637-007820 a more logical
sw04029-B_007820-008073 arrangement of the letters and uh
sw04029-B_008073-008352 what do they call it the Cortiope or something
sw04029-B_008352-008503 arrangement
sw04029-B_009146-009288 um
sw04029-B_009288-009480 we haven't for
sw04029-B_009480-009772 we ended up uh
sw04029-B_009772-010581 actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of [laughter-years] [laughter-isn't] that a terrible statement people who are
sw04029-B_010581-011180 we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um
sw04029-B_011314-011942 i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
sw04029-B_011942-012434 it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
sw04029-B_012434-012693 but then you have to remember to write it down
sw04029-B_012867-012996 or enter it
sw04029-B_013161-013354 oh my
sw04029-B_013354-013648 where do you find a place to work on a TI
sw04029-B_013904-014042 uh-huh
sw04029-B_014358-014732 well that's nice to know that there are still such people around
sw04029-B_015468-015990 yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until
sw04029-B_016144-016667 as i say until i took a hi[atus]- hiatus from working i used to
sw04029-B_016667-016851 to uh
sw04029-B_016976-017407 trying to think of what you call it i- i used it essentially as a terminal then
sw04029-B_017407-017498 you know
sw04029-B_017498-017733 and
sw04029-B_017733-017831 so
sw04029-B_018634-018735 yeah
sw04029-B_018868-019176 well my kids think i should have games
sw04029-B_019176-019514 on top of games on top of games [laughter]
sw04029-B_019514-020108 and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program [laughter]
sw04029-B_020255-020561 write your own games yeah i just
sw04029-B_021017-021142 oh
sw04029-B_021473-021571 yeah

sw04029-B_025562-026715 and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
sw04029-B_026715-027942 right [laughter] right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the
sw04029-B_027942-029211 connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the
sw04029-B_029211-029840 you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to wo[rk]-
sw04030-A_000000-000519 [noise] well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East what do you what do you think
sw04030-A_002401-002518 [laughter-yeah]
sw04030-A_002621-002849 it that that happens a lot doesn't it
sw04030-A_002849-003149 wars don't usually settle things [laughter] much
sw04030-A_003149-003698 um um and i i guess i i feel like we
sw04030-A_003698-004161 we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing
sw04030-A_004161-004659 uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts
sw04030-A_004659-005850 and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such
sw04030-A_005850-006126 we wouldn't have done this you know
sw04030-A_006126-006248 and would
sw04030-A_007416-007560 uh-huh
sw04030-A_008399-008548 yes [laughter]
sw04030-A_009052-009195 uh-huh
sw04030-A_009361-009483 yeah
sw04030-A_009609-009909 but Iran of course used to be our friend
sw04030-A_009909-010005 [laughter]
sw04030-A_010005-010293 i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it
sw04030-A_010293-010431 oh
sw04030-A_011101-011274 yeah um
sw04030-A_011498-011608 right
sw04030-A_011904-012249 on our hi[t]- on our really bad list [laughter]
sw04030-A_012549-013949 and i i i keep reading about Jordan's King Hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is
sw04030-A_015250-015541 r[ight]- yes yes right
sw04030-A_015541-015677 right
sw04030-A_016304-016953 of doing that either no [laughter] no i i i i just get a sense of our
sw04030-A_016953-017686 walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something
sw04030-A_017686-018273 didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or
sw04030-A_018273-018953 something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman
sw04030-A_018953-019901 you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while
sw04030-A_019901-021123 and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but
sw04030-A_024455-024692 oh absolutely yes
sw04030-A_024692-025232 i mean wh[ich]- which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation [laughter]
sw04030-A_025232-026449 every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like
sw04030-A_026449-026549 um
sw04030-A_026650-026738 yes
sw04030-A_026738-027222 it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like
sw04030-A_027222-027693 golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance
sw04030-A_027693-028427 possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting
sw04030-A_028427-028844 i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean [laughter-don't]
sw04030-A_028844-029562 [laughter] i i s[aw]- i i did see one of the peace rallies where they just said [laughter] i can't remember the exact thing it was
sw04030-A_029562-029939 something like George and Sa[ddam]- and Saddam go home
sw04030-B_000000-000066 [noise]
sw04030-B_000501-000747 well yeah i uh
sw04030-B_000747-001462 and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it
sw04030-B_001462-002207 a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh
sw04030-B_002207-002703 going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all i've
sw04030-B_002804-002899 um-hum
sw04030-B_003006-003198 yeah right
sw04030-B_004112-004249 right
sw04030-B_006062-006436 yeah and and i- i think there's a
sw04030-B_006541-006913 yeah i- i- i i have very much doubt that
sw04030-B_006913-007513 that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on
sw04030-B_007513-008468 in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend
sw04030-B_008468-008648 and that that
sw04030-B_008648-009127 Saddam Hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against Iran
sw04030-B_009127-009746 and uh Iran was our bigger enemy and then [laughter] when it turns out that uh Saddam Hussein
sw04030-B_009848-009963 right
sw04030-B_009963-010065 right
sw04030-B_010065-010195 and
sw04030-B_010195-010843 righ[t]- oh yes yes and when we decided Saddam Hussein was our enemy then the uh uh
sw04030-B_010843-011303 oh what's his name in uh Syria uh
sw04030-B_011303-012475 uh Hafaia Susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh
sw04030-B_012475-012667 you know and
sw04030-B_013318-013443 right
sw04030-B_013868-014261 right right and and uh
sw04030-B_014418-014977 i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being
sw04030-B_014977-015624 so definitely tied to to the Israeli side in terms of all of that Israeli versus Arab
sw04030-B_015624-015878 and uh
sw04030-B_015878-016768 i haven't [laughter-seen] uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that [laughter] yeah yeah so
sw04030-B_017555-017665 right
sw04030-B_017665-017761 right
sw04030-B_018218-018397 right and
sw04030-B_018932-019051 yes
sw04030-B_021085-021433 yeah well it it
sw04030-B_021433-022124 from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding
sw04030-B_022124-022503 [laughter] to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh
sw04030-B_022503-023068 i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh Iraq in particular
sw04030-B_023068-023666 was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that
sw04030-B_023666-024548 that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that Saddam Hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
sw04030-B_024548-024819 and and that uh
sw04030-B_025187-025451 uh oh boy
sw04030-B_026484-026914 oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fa[scinating]- fascinating watching
sw04030-B_026914-027041 yes
sw04030-B_027751-027886 yeah
sw04030-B_028353-028470 right
sw04030-B_028470-028596 right
sw04030-B_028700-028842 yes
sw04030-B_028842-028951 yes
sw04031-A_000000-000028 [noise]

sw04031-A_000197-000934 yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget
sw04031-A_001673-002866 yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue
sw04031-A_002866-004181 you've you've heard of him it's r[eally]- it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um
sw04031-A_004181-004916 ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um
sw04031-A_004916-005657 the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um
sw04031-A_005657-006504 the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so
sw04031-A_006504-006955 we may spend a little more there and a little less in a[nother]- in another area
sw04031-A_006955-007492 so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um
sw04031-A_007492-008440 you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do
sw04031-A_008440-009113 [noise] well [noise] we um
sw04031-A_009113-010172 i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend  no you may not 
sw04031-A_010172-011246 um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know [noise] some people do um [noise] en[velope]- en[velope]- envelope
sw04031-A_011246-011827 systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me
sw04031-A_012529-013770 yes we have um [vocalized-noise] we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and
sw04031-A_013770-014931 uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of [noise] it in CD's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have
sw04031-A_014931-016072 and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to
sw04031-A_016072-016731 put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for
sw04031-A_016731-017312 i[t]- you know things you know things like that and then um
sw04031-A_017312-018095 that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be
sw04031-A_018557-018841 i i'm sorry i didn'[t]- i didn't hear you
sw04031-A_019019-019249 [laughter-yeah]
sw04031-A_019440-019604 um
sw04031-A_019782-021112 well he recommends that you don't um or he hel[ps]- he recommends that you you get them_1 down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um
sw04031-A_021112-022358 every month if we use them_1 um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um
sw04031-A_022358-023186 [noise] i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it al[ways]- we will always work it out where
sw04031-A_023186-024281 where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them_1 just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards
sw04031-A_024281-025582 because_1 that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit
sw04031-A_025582-025931 so are you married

sw04031-B_016865-017016 um-hum
sw04031-B_017983-018530 that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted
sw04031-B_018728-019534 i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or
sw04031-B_019534-019854 is that part of the system to discontinue that
sw04031-B_020755-020899 um-hum
sw04031-B_023772-023900 um-hum
sw04031-B_024203-024344 um-hum

sw04032-B_001564-001724 yeah
sw04032-B_001724-002872 um [laughter] in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
sw04032-B_002872-003201 but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold
sw04032-B_003201-003600 um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
sw04032-B_003600-003697 um
sw04032-B_003799-003972 how about_1 yourself
sw04032-B_004503-004606 uh-huh
sw04032-B_005554-005679 um-hum
sw04032-B_006339-006896 right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
sw04032-B_007697-007813 um-hum
sw04032-B_010000-010090 huh
sw04032-B_010090-010518 yes it's it's it's aerob[ics]- it's similar to aerobics with weights
sw04032-B_010518-010889 but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights
sw04032-B_010889-011276 okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
sw04032-B_011719-012210 uh yes i have in in Atlanta that's um most of the health clubs
sw04032-B_012210-012515 are all that's the that's the in thing
sw04032-B_012515-013066 at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
sw04032-B_013215-013659 um it they call it a low impact aerobics
sw04032-B_013659-014012 and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
sw04032-B_014012-014320 and from when i've done it it does give you a good
sw04032-B_014320-014521 a real good [laughter-workout]
sw04032-B_014521-015078 but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
sw04032-B_015078-015422 you know that and movement of going up on the step
sw04032-B_015422-015651 you know that could create a problem
sw04032-B_015752-016139 they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know [noise]
sw04032-B_016612-016802 yeah i i think
sw04032-B_016802-017142 my ankles probably are my lame weak point but
sw04032-B_017142-017835 i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
sw04032-B_017835-018299 and um we[aring]- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
sw04032-B_018602-018708 yeah
sw04032-B_019428-019580 yeah i
sw04032-B_019848-019952 um-hum
sw04032-B_019952-020462 yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
sw04032-B_020462-020600 [laughter] i [laughter-mean]
sw04032-B_020600-020987 it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it
sw04032-B_020987-021516 because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
sw04032-B_021516-021747 [laughter]
sw04032-B_021871-022329 but um so how how successful is your exercise video
sw04032-B_022771-022889 uh-huh
sw04032-B_024115-024182 um
sw04032-B_024621-024748 um-hum
sw04032-B_026370-026497 um-hum
sw04032-B_027108-027290 so it's a good workout
sw04032-B_027290-027400 [noise]
sw04032-B_027761-027901 um-hum
sw04032-B_028022-028536 so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow
sw04033-A_000000-000318 [noise] so how do you get most of your current event information
sw04033-A_000702-000840 uh-huh
sw04033-A_001926-002059 right
sw04033-A_002221-002342 um-hum
sw04033-A_002694-003200 i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
sw04033-A_003327-003456 yeah
sw04033-A_003898-004944 right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um
sw04033-A_004944-005447 talking with people and just hearing what's going on but
sw04033-A_005713-006345 just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
sw04033-A_006345-006510 so
sw04033-A_006964-007266 oh uh-huh yeah
sw04033-A_008766-009700 right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a c[andidate]- candidate can get them to follow then the news will
sw04033-A_009700-010003 you know kind of publicize his name
sw04033-A_010003-010631 i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
sw04033-A_011781-011911 right
sw04033-A_012174-013101 right and the news too it just doesn't um cover a[ll]- that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
sw04033-A_013101-013794 and you know and and your ca[tastrophes]- catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
sw04033-A_013794-014805 um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
sw04033-A_014805-015454 it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
sw04033-A_016641-016831 right i
sw04033-A_017038-017319 i used to read every month a Reader's Digest
sw04033-A_017319-018656 but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w[ar]- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
sw04033-A_018656-020150 i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on [laughter] not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
sw04033-A_020150-020288 but
sw04033-A_020938-021059 right
sw04033-A_021059-021172 [noise]
sw04033-A_021172-022278 [noise] well i um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on
sw04033-A_022278-022801 outside of Texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
sw04033-A_022801-023691 that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
sw04033-A_024039-024841 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer Olympics [laughter]
sw04033-A_025694-026090 i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah
sw04033-A_026090-026323 [laughter]
sw04033-A_026323-026461 yeah
sw04033-A_027664-028921 right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but
sw04033-B_000312-001281 well duri[ng]- see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
sw04033-B_001281-002315 and i don't watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um
sw04033-B_002315-002688 i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
sw04033-B_003081-003368 that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
sw04033-B_003368-003954 people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
sw04033-B_004125-004262 uh-huh
sw04033-B_004724-004852 yeah
sw04033-B_005314-005955 do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour
sw04033-B_005955-006105 oh really
sw04033-B_006285-007033 uh-huh oh ch[annel]- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public TV so it's kind of different
sw04033-B_007133-007411 i think i think the uh
sw04033-B_007411-008342 i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
sw04033-B_008342-008841 they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
sw04033-B_009264-009399 yeah
sw04033-B_009945-010099 yeah exactly
sw04033-B_010555-011532 uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say
sw04033-B_011532-012254 you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r[ead]- and probably read something on it
sw04033-B_013058-013233 yeah [noise]
sw04033-B_013756-013889 yeah
sw04033-B_015378-016717 what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
sw04033-B_016717-017111 but other than that i don't really r[ead]- i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
sw04033-B_017252-017388 uh-huh
sw04033-B_018321-018479 oh yeah
sw04033-B_019197-019323 yeah
sw04033-B_019432-019571 [laughter]
sw04033-B_019814-019945 yeah
sw04033-B_020162-021005 well i remember dur[ing]- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because_1 that they were going constantly with that stuff
sw04033-B_021005-021151 but uh
sw04033-B_021267-021390 [vocalized-noise]
sw04033-B_022749-022887 yeah
sw04033-B_023489-024234 if they reported every m[urder]- if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news [laughter-hour] but uh
sw04033-B_024589-025833 oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o[n]- on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
sw04033-B_025833-026340 oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh
sw04033-B_026340-026950 i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over
sw04033-B_026950-027904 i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know tr[aining]- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
sw04033-B_028708-028973 yeah it seems like
sw04033-B_028973-029875 i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or [vocalized-noise] if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s[ome]- some channel for it but i don't have cable
sw04034-A_000000-000311 uh do you have any recycling going on in your community
sw04034-A_001428-001538 uh-huh
sw04034-A_002300-002398 [laughter-oh]
sw04034-A_003705-003801 uh-huh
sw04034-A_004159-004434 so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but
sw04034-A_004857-004977 oh really
sw04034-A_006609-007053 it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will
sw04034-A_007053-007265 recycle magazines
sw04034-A_007367-007658 the glossy magazines yes
sw04034-A_007658-007784 uh
sw04034-A_007784-008025 and then they charge you for the service
sw04034-A_008853-008987 uh-huh
sw04034-A_008987-009292 was this something that was voted on or uh
sw04034-A_009447-009637 hum by the City Council or something
sw04034-A_009637-009752 uh-huh
sw04034-A_010241-010330 uh-huh
sw04034-A_012175-012290 um
sw04034-A_012463-012654 they'd charge for it [vocalized-noise]
sw04034-A_012654-012777 whether
sw04034-A_012777-012951 you take advantage of it or not
sw04034-A_013514-013630 uh-huh
sw04034-A_014076-014184 uh-huh
sw04034-A_014619-014728 um-hum
sw04034-A_015614-015757 right
sw04034-A_015921-016085 well we have uh
sw04034-A_016188-017548 some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in [vocalized-noise] our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines
sw04034-A_017548-018398 uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
sw04034-A_018398-018621 and uh cardboard
sw04034-A_018621-018845 and it used to be free
sw04034-A_018845-019183 for a few weeks then they
sw04034-A_019183-019885 sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations
sw04034-A_019885-020003 and i
sw04034-A_020003-020851 i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now
sw04034-A_020851-021012 uh
sw04034-A_021012-021192 and i [vocalized-noise]
sw04034-A_021192-021700 i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out
sw04034-A_021700-021939 so it may work out monetarily
sw04034-A_021939-022199 okay for us to be charged for it
sw04034-A_022199-022726 uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash
sw04034-A_023095-023396 right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people
sw04034-A_023396-023594 this is another this is uh
sw04034-A_023594-023943 um Carl Carl's recycling
sw04034-A_023943-024459 and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh
sw04034-A_024459-024678 private and nonmandatory
sw04034-A_024678-024917 and people just put things out on the curb
sw04034-A_024917-025224 um he's competing with some uh
sw04034-A_025224-026049 very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables
sw04034-A_026049-026224 so it's uh
sw04034-A_026916-027018 um-hum
sw04034-A_027836-028267 yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh
sw04034-A_028267-028760 they have all this used newsprint that people don't want
sw04034-A_028760-028895 right
sw04034-B_000241-000634 uh yes we do we've started out with uh um
sw04034-B_000634-001294 all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up uh lots of
sw04034-B_001294-001490 different kinds of waste
sw04034-B_001490-001667 and they uh
sw04034-B_001788-002267 uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times
sw04034-B_002267-002369 uh
sw04034-B_002369-002679 and uh so
sw04034-B_002679-003340 now you have all kinds of of uh things that they didn't use to pick up like magazines and uh
sw04034-B_003340-003598 various forms of of uh
sw04034-B_003598-004004 glass tin and things like that
sw04034-B_004004-004128 uh
sw04034-B_004398-005861 well no [vocalized-noise] in a a long time ago you didn't uh they didn't pick up any of that and and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately they've gone in to it in a big way and they've said the uh they have to pick up
sw04034-B_005861-005999 i think it's
sw04034-B_005999-006687 uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up
sw04034-B_007476-007606 yes
sw04034-B_008001-008251 yes well now these so they're
sw04034-B_008251-008962 we're being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people
sw04034-B_009332-009532 uh
sw04034-B_009532-009888 the City Council did it they decided that that there was
sw04034-B_009888-010010 Portland is kind of a
sw04034-B_010126-010499 ecology minded area and so they uh
sw04034-B_010499-010861 uh although there're some complaints because the
sw04034-B_010861-011448 there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the
sw04034-B_011448-012231 the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh
sw04034-B_012231-012374 uh
sw04034-B_012546-012727 they charge
sw04034-B_012888-013577 much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing
sw04034-B_013577-014119 in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now
sw04034-B_014119-014652 because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now
sw04034-B_014652-015307 so they can you know it's the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can
sw04034-B_015307-015663 they don't have to work very hard at at keeping costs down
sw04034-B_015800-015974 so how about your area
sw04034-B_022750-023095 of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up
sw04034-B_023351-023481 oh i see what you're saying
sw04034-B_026174-026632 the thing that that uh has another thing that's been in the press here has been
sw04034-B_026632-027444 that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the uh
sw04034-B_027567-027829 how should i say it the market can't absorb
sw04034-B_027829-027969 all of the uh
sw04034-B_028838-029486 right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market it's piling up uh
sw04034-B_029606-029891 i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from
sw04035-A_000000-000167 [noise] how do you feel about capital punishment
sw04035-A_000392-000534 yeah
sw04035-A_000534-000718 [noise] for what reasons

sw04035-A_002153-003167 [noise] yeah definitely yeah i- i [noise] i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the econ[omic]- for economic reasons because i- i don't think it acts as a deterrent
sw04035-A_003167-004503 [noise] and i don't think that um [noise] and and and for what i've what i've read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed them for the en[d]- end you know

sw04035-A_012675-013755 [noise] yeah they do um [noise] yeah i'm not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone i don't really [laughter-keep] you know i don't really keep up after when the last one was

sw04035-A_019053-019184 um-hum
sw04035-A_019762-019924 in Tennessee
sw04035-A_020175-020961 you know one thing that i've always that i've one idea that i've heard that that that i've you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone that's
sw04035-A_020961-022287 you know that that that that you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty
sw04035-A_022287-022715 it ju[st]- seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know
sw04035-A_023373-023520 [laughter]
sw04035-A_023520-023633 uh-huh
sw04035-A_023885-024481 uh-huh yeah he he told us his yeah he said that he wanted to die at that point [vocalized-noise]
sw04035-A_025716-025902 um-hum [noise] it
sw04035-A_026004-027356 you know it really bothers me that in historical cases you know where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know and when they're you know on death row and and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them [laughter]
sw04035-A_027356-027642 and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of
sw04035-A_029302-029442 um-hum
sw04035-A_029442-029645 oh like in Texas
sw04035-B_000000-000092 [noise]
sw04035-B_000092-000558 um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it
sw04035-B_000661-001674 uh i think that they make a lo[t]- the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um
sw04035-B_001674-002212 you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late
sw04035-B_004456-005425 yeah it dose because because of uh [noise] the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should
sw04035-B_005425-006216 but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the Supreme Court
sw04035-B_006216-007195 um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the Supreme Court when they used to be
sw04035-B_007195-008566 so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh
sw04035-B_008566-008993 down in Tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row
sw04035-B_009102-009895 [noise] yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um [noise] let's say um
sw04035-B_009895-011074 cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convic[ted]- certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway
sw04035-B_011074-011551 i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't
sw04035-B_011863-012050 yeah so
sw04035-B_012286-012917 no huh um they do in Georgia right yeah they
sw04035-B_013533-014203 [laughter-right] well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that
sw04035-B_014203-015015 just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the
sw04035-B_015015-016279 the bottom line was that uh [noise] what was i saying uh nobody in Tennessee has been con[victed]- has been executed since nineteen
sw04035-B_016279-016780 uh sev[enty]- uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and un[constitutional]-
sw04035-B_016780-017994 yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials
sw04035-B_017994-018405 um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not
sw04035-B_018405-019211 um then then that's okay they can it it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have
sw04035-B_019211-019900 um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and
sw04035-B_019900-020362 yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them_1 [laughter-yeah]
sw04035-B_022281-022409 yeah
sw04035-B_022656-023935 yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy Gary Gilmore did right
sw04035-B_023935-024105 you know the guy
sw04035-B_024268-024965 right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um
sw04035-B_024965-025809 yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in dea[th]- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want
sw04035-B_025809-026141 [vocalized-noise] which is basically what that is but
sw04035-B_027314-027534 yeah sure
sw04035-B_027534-028762 i did some i did some en[vironmental]- environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the F D A they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug
sw04035-B_028996-029971 it was a drug that was that they were using for the death penalty and they tr[ied]- to right they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve it [laughter]
sw04036-A_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04036-A_000036-000333 i think that uh one uh advantage
sw04036-A_000333-001277 of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um
sw04036-A_001277-002204 and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
sw04036-A_002204-002615 is very unreasonable in some way that uh
sw04036-A_002615-002872 you uh would have a problem
sw04036-A_002872-003279 uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
sw04036-A_003423-003708 have you ever served on a jury before
sw04036-A_003811-003892 oh
sw04036-A_004047-004268 uh what sorts of cases were they
sw04036-A_005100-005337 so were they criminal or civil
sw04036-A_005507-005640 oh okay
sw04036-A_005742-006277 what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
sw04036-A_006967-007083 yeah
sw04036-A_007634-007783 so did it become
sw04036-A_008040-008171 yeah
sw04036-A_008371-008477 ah
sw04036-A_008585-008670 oh
sw04036-A_008670-009079 but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
sw04036-A_009079-009425 what was what was the other case that was also civil
sw04036-A_010074-010197 yeah
sw04036-A_010339-010496 oh didn't really even count
sw04036-A_010496-011251 yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um
sw04036-A_011251-011743 and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i
sw04036-A_011743-012246 declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
sw04036-A_012514-013256 yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i- i haven't
sw04036-A_013256-013644 um one one thing that i- i think is um
sw04036-A_013644-014688 you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
sw04036-A_014688-014943 uh especially sort of
sw04036-A_014943-015148 ow well
sw04036-A_015561-015700 [noise] the
sw04036-A_015997-016248 ah but you thought it turned out pretty well
sw04036-A_017060-017193 yeah
sw04036-A_017567-018067 oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
sw04036-A_018067-019082 hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or
sw04036-A_019799-020078 so it worked it did end up working out pretty well
sw04036-A_020078-020657 the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh
sw04036-A_020657-021625 whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro[duct]- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
sw04036-A_021625-022393 you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of
sw04036-A_022393-023125 uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um
sw04036-A_023125-024085 if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
sw04036-A_024611-025172 in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so
sw04036-A_025742-025846 yeah
sw04036-A_026049-026163 ah
sw04036-A_026163-026745 oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments
sw04036-A_026914-027043 yeah
sw04036-A_027482-027764 ah so they were suing to get it back
sw04036-A_027989-028155 ah
sw04036-A_028155-028314 yeah
sw04036-A_029049-029185 uh
sw04036-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04036-B_001084-001250 definitely
sw04036-B_003238-003409 um-hum
sw04036-B_003570-003802 uh i have twice
sw04036-B_003802-004072 it was pretty wild experience
sw04036-B_004224-005100 they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
sw04036-B_005383-005757 they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal
sw04036-B_006241-007034 uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because_1 they only had to have eleven people
sw04036-B_007034-007493 so it was they and uh the one changed his vote
sw04036-B_007493-007673 at the end
sw04036-B_007673-008651 so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so
sw04036-B_008998-009131 right
sw04036-B_009397-009711 the the uh other case was just traffic
sw04036-B_009711-010352 the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly
sw04036-B_010352-010531 go through so
sw04036-B_011100-011226 yeah
sw04036-B_012188-012565 yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
sw04036-B_014619-014754 it [vocalized-noise]
sw04036-B_014754-015001 [vocalized-noise] i wouldn't think that it does
sw04036-B_015001-015570 i mean from from my e[xperience]- from what i experienced in them_1 it didn't you know it didn't
sw04036-B_015570-016174 didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it
sw04036-B_016174-016755 yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and
sw04036-B_016755-017196 it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so
sw04036-B_017196-017690 i'm not used to it not being organized and i just a[ssumed]- assumed that it would have been
sw04036-B_017806-017945 that's
sw04036-B_017945-018159 that's about what it was [noise]
sw04036-B_019004-019633 yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it
sw04036-B_019633-019960 turn out the way it should have so
sw04036-B_019960-020197 yeah it ended up working all right
sw04036-B_021557-021688 yes
sw04036-B_024020-024443 uh i don't think that they they they educate them_1 enough to
sw04036-B_024443-024684 to really know what's going on
sw04036-B_025014-025747 yeah [vocalized-noise] the bank was suing them_1 for uh because they went to get the the trailer
sw04036-B_025747-026289 that which was [assumingly/assumably] their property it was on his property
sw04036-B_026529-026649 right
sw04036-B_026751-026969 so they came to get it
sw04036-B_026969-027566 and then when they came to get it well i[t]- it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them_1 take it off
sw04036-B_027696-028060 so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
sw04036-B_028060-028250 so they left it there
sw04036-B_028250-028452 and then when
sw04036-B_028452-029107 they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
sw04036-B_029107-029421 so they were suing him for the money and
sw04036-B_029421-029741 you know there's no way they could because it's
sw04036-B_029741-029962 it was the moving company [vocalized-noise]
sw04037-A_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04037-A_000039-000691 uh Greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty

sw04037-A_005948-006017 [noise]
sw04037-A_006017-006575 uh when i was in coll[ege]- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International
sw04037-A_006575-007479 and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh ho[w]- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
sw04037-A_007479-007727 but [noise] the uh
sw04037-A_007727-008752 the more now i live in [vocalized-noise] downtown Dallas and i uh [laughter] you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
sw04037-A_008752-009119 person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
sw04037-A_009119-009188 [noise]
sw04037-A_009188-009400 i think that [noise] maybe a
sw04037-A_009400-010278 a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder
sw04037-A_010479-010677 yeah uh i-
sw04037-A_010677-011660 yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i- uh i- i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
sw04037-A_011660-011746 uh
sw04037-A_011746-011853 [noise]
sw04037-A_011853-013057 i also [noise] uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh
sw04037-A_013057-013744 big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example th[ese]- these people need to be uh eliminated uh
sw04037-A_013744-014431 from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh
sw04037-A_014431-014749 uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh
sw04037-A_014749-014945 create another power structure [laughter]

sw04037-A_028720-029207 uh well here in Texas we uh i think even even this last week
sw04037-A_029207-029879 uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
sw04037-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04037-B_000642-001123 yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often [noise] but we do have it
sw04037-B_001123-001503 i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
sw04037-B_001503-002154 uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
sw04037-B_002154-003450 seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
sw04037-B_003558-004683 uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten la[te]- years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
sw04037-B_004683-005060 just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
sw04037-B_006488-006610 uh-huh
sw04037-B_007411-007538 right
sw04037-B_008062-008187 right
sw04037-B_009072-009198 right
sw04037-B_010203-010757 that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that wh[ich]- which seems pretty sensible
sw04037-B_011596-011734 right
sw04037-B_012536-012709 [laughter-right] yeah
sw04037-B_013367-013497 uh-huh
sw04037-B_013656-013785 uh-huh
sw04037-B_014862-015192 yeah you're you're right there uh
sw04037-B_015192-015723 i ju[st]- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
sw04037-B_015723-016639 y[ou]- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
sw04037-B_016639-017536 i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
sw04037-B_017536-018481 to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
sw04037-B_019681-021083 well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
sw04037-B_021083-021607 and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
sw04037-B_021607-022801 and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God [laughter] which is n[ever]- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld
sw04037-B_022801-023850 uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
sw04037-B_023850-024598 uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that they're
sw04037-B_024598-025264 they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think tha[t]- that it's
sw04037-B_025264-026114 it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
sw04037-B_027236-027370 um-hum
sw04037-B_027370-027473 yeah
sw04037-B_027858-028094 y[eah]- yeah that is very curious
sw04037-B_028370-028501 yeah
sw04037-B_028501-028740 that's that's right
sw04038-A_000000-000404 [noise] okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now
sw04038-A_000404-000554 uh
sw04038-A_000691-001816 i served i was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one
sw04038-A_002464-002597 uh-huh
sw04038-A_003027-003272 was it civil or criminal
sw04038-A_003377-003563 a grand jury or some[thing]-
sw04038-A_004004-004139 uh-huh
sw04038-A_004469-004609 i see
sw04038-A_005526-005656 uh-huh
sw04038-A_006453-007127 uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that
sw04038-A_008283-008444 uh-huh
sw04038-A_008444-008649 um
sw04038-A_008649-008822 no
sw04038-A_009388-009521 that
sw04038-A_009521-009763 that's a science in itself
sw04038-A_010713-011376 uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to [vocalized-noise]
sw04038-A_011741-012044 uh-huh [laughter]
sw04038-A_012044-013050 so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
sw04038-A_015517-015637 huh
sw04038-A_017285-017441 um
sw04038-A_017441-017725 wow i bet that made him happy
sw04038-A_019072-019209 right
sw04038-A_019572-019706 uh-huh
sw04038-A_020128-020275 yeah
sw04038-A_020275-020682 oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury
sw04038-A_020791-021514 uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh
sw04038-A_021514-022324 a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
sw04038-A_022324-023018 but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
sw04038-A_023148-024570 i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s[imple]- a simple majority you know rules
sw04038-A_024570-025103 yeah
sw04038-A_025103-025659 a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we [vocalized-noise] the two that i were on had to do with drugs
sw04038-A_025659-027134 and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things
sw04038-A_027134-028337 the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases
sw04038-A_028453-029815 uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
sw04038-A_029815-029984 all they could do was testify about
sw04038-B_000000-000093 [noise]
sw04038-B_000322-000467 yeah
sw04038-B_000467-000750 so have you ever served on a jury
sw04038-B_001763-002532 [noise] yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet
sw04038-B_002532-003063 and i finally was [noise] so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring
sw04038-B_003205-003441 uh it was uh
sw04038-B_003441-003799 [noise] uh it was uh
sw04038-B_003799-004512 well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks
sw04038-B_004512-005601 so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then
sw04038-B_005601-006515 it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room
sw04038-B_007018-007895 uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh
sw04038-B_007895-008541 i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me
sw04038-B_008541-009609 course they don't have to give a reason but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions
sw04038-B_009718-010122 yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh
sw04038-B_010122-010514 questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh
sw04038-B_010514-010850 they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more
sw04038-B_010850-011037 [laughter]
sw04038-B_011165-011811 yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know
sw04038-B_011811-011943 [laughter]
sw04038-B_012990-014419 well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh
sw04038-B_014419-015590 decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty
sw04038-B_015590-016464 so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating
sw04038-B_016464-017597 allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that uh we weren't were una[ble]- unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again
sw04038-B_017597-017811 [laughter-yeah]
sw04038-B_017811-018094 yeah it was uh it was funny
sw04038-B_018094-018471 the uh i ju[st]- i- i don't know i uh
sw04038-B_018471-018666 i didn't uh
sw04038-B_018843-019658 uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate and uh i uh i- i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed
sw04038-B_019658-020196 so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure
sw04038-B_020612-020888 uh it must have been six
sw04038-B_020888-021020 yeah
sw04038-B_022245-022369 um
sw04038-B_022999-023114 um
sw04038-B_024506-024644 yeah
sw04038-B_024644-025203 well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and
sw04038-B_025625-025758 uh-huh
sw04038-B_028263-028533 uh t[oo]- it was too circumstantial
sw04038-B_029755-029883 um
sw04039-A_000000-000553 [noise] course i don't like talking about budgets [laughter] no not my favorite subject

sw04040-A_020858-021599 and uh i think it's a good dea[l]- deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's
sw04040-A_021599-022193 it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself
sw04040-A_022684-023216 well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
sw04040-A_023216-023671 uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in
sw04040-A_023671-023841 in [vocalized-noise]
sw04040-A_024945-025572 oh yeah um um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had
sw04040-A_025572-025994 so you know it it worked out pretty good
sw04040-A_026654-026828 uh
sw04040-A_026828-027088 well i haven't really thought about it like that
sw04040-A_027088-027257 [laughter]
sw04040-A_027257-027583 because well you know we pay [noise]
sw04040-A_027583-028292 excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
sw04040-A_028292-028770 uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know
sw04040-A_028770-029309 to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it
sw04040-B_000000-000206 [noise] uh hello Steve
sw04040-B_000206-000450 uh you were going to talk about child care
sw04040-B_001012-001078 um-hum
sw04040-B_001867-001973 um-hum
sw04040-B_002279-002350 um-hum
sw04040-B_003414-003720 i see how much how much do they charge
sw04040-B_004021-004737 uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week
sw04040-B_005242-005703 right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service
sw04040-B_006163-006264 uh-huh
sw04040-B_006264-006553 uh how long have you been taking your son there
sw04040-B_006739-007044 uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or
sw04040-B_007342-007441 i see
sw04040-B_007548-007710 you say you went back to school
sw04040-B_007812-007992 oh i see uh-huh
sw04040-B_008130-008243 uh-huh
sw04040-B_008243-008650 um gee i think [laughter] [noise] where where does she go to school
sw04040-B_008882-009301 uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time
sw04040-B_009301-009645 but i think we're getting [laughter-off] the topic [laughter-so]
sw04040-B_009645-010800 so um [noise] let's see i mean i- i was uh rea[ding]- i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done
sw04040-B_010800-012057 and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers
sw04040-B_012163-013004 and uh that was i- i thought it was import[ant]- well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose
sw04040-B_013004-013770 because a lot of kids are in you know in centers we[ll]- well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh
sw04040-B_013770-014571 uh that's the sort of the[y]- the[y]- they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them_1 very far
sw04040-B_014571-015279 plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could
sw04040-B_015279-016113 fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble
sw04040-B_016113-017316 um so uh anyway [laughter] i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh
sw04040-B_017316-018050 still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really would[n't]- wouldn't um uh well i'm on
sw04040-B_018050-019459 gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there
sw04040-B_020008-020122 uh-huh
sw04040-B_020122-020249 uh-huh
sw04040-B_020623-020703 uh-huh
sw04040-B_020821-020951 right uh-huh
sw04040-B_021513-021710 yeah it's just a lot of time
sw04040-B_022117-022758 yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students [laughter]
sw04040-B_023417-023539 uh-huh
sw04040-B_023539-023647 yeah
sw04040-B_023647-025023 yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
sw04040-B_025559-025613 um-hum
sw04040-B_025921-026663 s[o]- s[o]- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which s[eems]- seems most appealing to you
sw04040-B_027272-027404 yeah
sw04040-B_027404-027546 i think
sw04040-B_027546-027668 well th[e]-
sw04040-B_028208-028351 that's right yeah
sw04040-B_029169-029991 well i mean the[y]- they yeah the i[ssue]- the issue is whether they can uh take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other pro[blem]-
sw04041-A_000000-000609 i haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet
sw04041-A_001120-001275 um-hum
sw04041-A_001520-001763 that's for sure yeah
sw04041-A_002189-002902 um-hum um-hum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too [laughter]
sw04041-A_002902-003910 yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were s[ick]- not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was
sw04041-A_003910-004458 what do you do with the other person it's particularly hard if they live away
sw04041-A_004624-004780 um-hum
sw04041-A_005075-005206 yeah
sw04041-A_005513-005998 well that's a problem and i [vocalized-noise] uh my grandmother was ninety
sw04041-A_005998-007389 two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point
sw04041-A_007389-008447 it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like that's where sh[e]- she wanted to die was where she was not to
sw04041-A_008447-009311 staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think it's harder if they if they're younger but need a lot of care
sw04041-A_009311-010004 you know at ninety that's one thing at at sixty or seventy it's something else and yet
sw04041-A_010276-010520 right right
sw04041-A_010520-011254 right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's
sw04041-A_011254-012221 you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be cl[ean]- you know
sw04041-A_012221-013076 clean and that that it's got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference
sw04041-A_013776-014287 yes that that's the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls
sw04041-A_014287-014460 oh
sw04041-A_015087-015335 Alzheimer yeah
sw04041-A_016133-016273 uh-huh
sw04041-A_016399-016542 yeah
sw04041-A_016659-017638 well i that's the thing i mean when it's something like that i- i think it particularly if it's something like that and they really don't know where they are
sw04041-A_017638-018319 it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d[on't]-
sw04041-A_018319-018549 exactly
sw04041-A_018549-019138 and i you know i do[n't]- i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother
sw04041-A_019138-020163 moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and that's where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years
sw04041-A_020163-021083 and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said
sw04041-A_021083-022511 w[ell]- she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and there're people there
sw04041-A_022511-023692 which in her home you know there weren't i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said i've i've really made some friends and that feels good so that's the other side of it is
sw04041-A_023967-024212 um-hum um-hum
sw04041-A_024369-024698 yeah but but it's just that
sw04041-A_024698-025538 you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly
sw04041-A_026023-026172 uh-huh
sw04041-A_026598-027425 exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and that's another hard thing
sw04041-A_027425-027965 uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh
sw04041-A_027965-028838 fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not [laughter]
sw04041-A_028838-029054 uh-huh
sw04041-A_029054-029633 so they'll tell you well she says she doesn't like the food but you should see her plate you know or some
sw04041-A_029633-029907 so then y[ou]- i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's
sw04041-B_000000-000583 [noise]
sw04041-B_000583-001553 no i haven't either but a lot of my friends and actually my boss had to put his mother in a nursing home and i know just going through it with him i mean it's a real traumatic experience
sw04041-B_001653-002300 first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know
sw04041-B_002827-002971 oh really
sw04041-B_003790-003913 um-hum
sw04041-B_004385-005194 okay that's what i was just going to say if they're out of state you know it's different if they're in the same town i think you have a little more chance to look out for them_1 but
sw04041-B_005194-005605 then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there
sw04041-B_006210-006350 um-hum
sw04041-B_008067-008220 uh-huh
sw04041-B_008220-008736 oh oh you mean not staying at home -[y]ou mean and not yeah yeah
sw04041-B_009248-009399 um-hum
sw04041-B_009870-010684 no yeah well that's just it because i mean jeez they've got p[robably]- probably good twenty years to live you know so[me]- some cases if they're healthy you know
sw04041-B_012115-012359 it would be clean yeah
sw04041-B_012969-014027 i know and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know
sw04041-B_014027-014206 um-hum
sw04041-B_014206-014370 yeah
sw04041-B_014370-015313 in fact i used to date a guy that reminds me when i was back in Minneapolis but his mother i mean he had she ended up i guess getting it Al[zheimer's]- what they now call Alzheimer's yeah
sw04041-B_015313-015868 but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and we'd go to visit her but then
sw04041-B_015868-016733 it would get you know like she didn't really know she didn't know me and then she thought he was a brother you know and it just got steadily worse you know
sw04041-B_017570-017712 um-hum
sw04041-B_018215-018587 and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know
sw04041-B_019588-019715 um
sw04041-B_019715-019847 um-hum
sw04041-B_019847-019977 um
sw04041-B_020622-020803 just getting used to it
sw04041-B_020803-020931 oh
sw04041-B_021608-021739 [laughter]
sw04041-B_021840-021964 uh-huh
sw04041-B_022310-022452 oh
sw04041-B_022452-022582 uh-huh
sw04041-B_023602-024487 well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because_1 they'd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess
sw04041-B_025446-026100 well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when they're expecting you to come
sw04041-B_026100-026660 you know just to see how you know at different times of the day what they do and how they treat them you know
sw04041-B_027544-027674 [vocalized-noise]
sw04041-B_028113-028248 um-hum
sw04041-B_028655-029123 or is it just because yeah they're having such a hard time adjusting you know
sw04041-B_029510-029645 um-hum
sw04042-A_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04042-A_000562-000708 oh you are
sw04042-A_000708-000997 you're you're into uh recycling
sw04042-A_001392-001688 um-hum what materials do you recycle
sw04042-A_002266-002373 um-hum
sw04042-A_003426-003538 um-hum
sw04042-A_004600-004718 so
sw04042-A_005010-005414 so you're trying to take action to have that changed
sw04042-A_006518-006641 um-hum
sw04042-A_007456-008073 right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention [laughter]
sw04042-A_008073-008208 right
sw04042-A_008841-008962 um-hum
sw04042-A_010128-011423 well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was
sw04042-A_011423-011950 forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound
sw04042-A_011950-012625 so it uh [noise] there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment
sw04042-A_013597-013724 um-hum
sw04042-A_014791-014916 right
sw04042-A_015661-016261 hm yeah where [noise] where i work we recycle paper that's about it
sw04042-A_016394-017141 yeah any any um non[colored]- noncolored or {nonfilm} type paper just white paper and that sort of thing
sw04042-A_017141-017266 and
sw04042-A_017505-017620 uh
sw04042-A_017722-018199 oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated
sw04042-A_018199-018584 for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper
sw04042-A_018584-018890 we don't use the green bar type paper any more
sw04042-A_018890-019069 right [laughter]
sw04042-A_019990-020116 um-hum
sw04042-A_020528-021033 well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling
sw04042-A_021033-021141 i mean
sw04042-A_021141-021571 unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing
sw04042-A_022148-022271 um-hum
sw04042-A_023167-023299 um-hum
sw04042-A_023562-024587 [noise] right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis
sw04042-A_024587-024747 right
sw04042-A_025787-025911 right
sw04042-A_026130-026266 [laughter]
sw04042-A_026437-026556 [noise]
sw04042-A_029643-029760 right
sw04042-B_000000-000230 [noise] topic is recycling today
sw04042-B_000230-000782 and actually i'm pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am
sw04042-B_000926-001480 i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact
sw04042-B_001637-002033 i recycle glass plastic and aluminum
sw04042-B_002033-002299 also paper and plastic bags
sw04042-B_002299-002944 and i uh in Dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening
sw04042-B_002944-003478 about what's being done with the recycled the recycling materials
sw04042-B_003478-004350 and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills
sw04042-B_004350-005050 and i got really hot about that because my h[usband]- my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and it's packed in green glass
sw04042-B_005352-006542 well yeah i'm i'm racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in Atlanta
sw04042-B_006542-006808 and they're paying i think
sw04042-B_006909-007096 eighteen cents
sw04042-B_007096-007489 for every hundred pounds of green glass
sw04042-B_007980-008289 no i'm not but i've got
sw04042-B_008289-008546 good gosh i've got probably
sw04042-B_008546-008901 twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now
sw04042-B_008901-009328 waiting for a recycling place to take it to and
sw04042-B_009328-009783 i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to
sw04042-B_009783-010189 was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that
sw04042-B_011011-011147 yeah
sw04042-B_011857-012009 um-hum
sw04042-B_012274-012409 no
sw04042-B_012554-013648 well that's the that's the thing is [noise] i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center
sw04042-B_013648-014599 and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world
sw04042-B_014599-015138 in regards to education and i think that's a real worthwhile project and
sw04042-B_015138-015724 that's really what got me started recycling was this uh community center
sw04042-B_015724-015887 so
sw04042-B_016194-016495 do you which kind of pap[er]- computer paper
sw04042-B_016495-016656 oh any
sw04042-B_016840-016956 uh-huh
sw04042-B_017058-017400 oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper
sw04042-B_017503-017772 i mean like the the green and white barred
sw04042-B_017883-018094 oh you don't use that paper okay
sw04042-B_018266-018679 oh yeah [noise] uh-huh

sw04043-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04043-B_000154-001097 i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh
sw04043-B_001097-001653 alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that
sw04043-B_001765-003007 country's not bad i c[an]- i grew up in Nebraska so it was like um yeah i- i listen to it once in a while but it's it's probably not my my top mode i guess that's pretty pretty popular down in Plano though uh
sw04043-B_003910-004048 oh yeah
sw04043-B_004507-004823 so you didn't do anything at all right [laughter]
sw04043-B_004938-005041 huh

sw04043-B_006554-006828 and you're also into the Christian contemporary stuff
sw04043-B_006828-007259 yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um
sw04043-B_007259-007699 groups like uh i'm trying to remember DMZ
sw04043-B_007699-007997 Resurrection Band uh what else
sw04043-B_007997-008367 there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into Petra as well
sw04043-B_008367-008869 in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i- i'm going to school in Florida
sw04043-B_008869-009258 and he's an engineer that does sound mi[xing]- mixing right now for a Christian bands
sw04043-B_009258-009444 so yeah he's pretty into it
sw04043-B_009444-009709 it's been it's been [lucratim/lucrative] for him
sw04043-B_009961-010247 well yeah um kind of like
sw04043-B_010247-010588 i don't know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock [laughter]
sw04043-B_010588-011230 but then now it's it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's it's gone more diverse toward
sw04043-B_011230-011673 um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs
sw04043-B_011673-011991 really a wider more eclectic uh
sw04043-B_011991-012876 tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um
sw04043-B_012876-014022 yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so
sw04043-B_014022-014675 it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all
sw04043-B_014961-015076 yeah
sw04043-B_015221-015382 oh wow
sw04043-B_015652-015982 sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh
sw04043-B_015982-016116 i know that feeling
sw04043-B_016116-016213 yeah
sw04043-B_016531-016751 [laughter]
sw04043-B_016866-017275 yeah well may[be]- hey that may be more quality you know after all
sw04043-B_017500-017636 yeah
sw04043-B_018591-018807 Joe Scruggs huh
sw04043-B_019415-019603 interesting uh
sw04043-B_019603-020304 when you said Scruggs i was thinking because_1 Earl Scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player
sw04043-B_020304-020804 and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies
sw04043-B_020804-020995 he actually played part of that
sw04043-B_020995-021461 uh he and Lester Flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative [laughter]
sw04043-B_021461-021577 but
sw04043-B_021577-021728 [vocalized-noise] any[way]-
sw04043-B_022404-022549 oh
sw04043-B_023098-023429 yeah i haven't heard much about that no
sw04043-B_023926-024023 yeah
sw04043-B_024556-024947 all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit
sw04043-B_024947-025338 i'm uh i'm not quite at that point in my life [laughter-yet] so
sw04043-B_025338-025821 it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so
sw04043-B_026070-026188 yeah
sw04043-B_027030-027166 um-hum
sw04043-B_027596-027705 right
sw04043-B_028695-028826 um-hum
sw04043-B_028826-029912 well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the Appalachian Mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i- i've had some friends from West Virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there
sw04043-B_029912-029952 an[d]-
sw04044-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04044-A_000027-000336 i guess my basic feeling is that
sw04044-A_000336-001544 as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but
sw04044-A_001544-002535 uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and
sw04044-A_002637-002949 i don't know [laughter] i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all
sw04044-A_006794-006932 [laughter]
sw04044-A_007034-007482 yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been
sw04044-A_007482-008570 discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation
sw04044-A_008570-009619 seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the
sw04044-A_009619-010262 sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the
sw04044-A_010262-011238 entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity [vocalized-noise]
sw04044-A_011238-011418 yeah although
sw04044-A_011418-011539 my
sw04044-A_011539-011695 oh excuse me
sw04044-A_012251-013319 yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
sw04044-A_013319-014195 today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not
sw04044-A_014195-015186 but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs
sw04044-A_015186-015545 for instance or public improvements and today there
sw04044-A_015545-016135 there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation
sw04044-A_018892-019038 [laughter]
sw04044-A_020165-020280 um-hum
sw04044-A_022098-022890 yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for
sw04044-A_022890-023696 tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly
sw04044-A_024446-024549 yeah
sw04044-A_029530-029626 yeah
sw04044-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04044-B_002886-003202 do you think that that's because the uh
sw04044-B_003202-003675 because the politicians have been seduced by the the opportunity to get the vote
sw04044-B_003675-003987 uh so they've spent the money on
sw04044-B_003987-004685 on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh
sw04044-B_004685-004939 [noise] uh let's see how shall i say it
sw04044-B_004939-005203 paying money to people that that uh
sw04044-B_005203-005298 [noise]
sw04044-B_005298-005401 uh
sw04044-B_005549-006150 it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh
sw04044-B_006150-006253 [noise]
sw04044-B_006253-006580 uh input of money can uh
sw04044-B_006580-006999 which they can never turn off by the way uh will get this guy votes
sw04044-B_011112-011248 there was
sw04044-B_011419-011560 [vocalized-noise]
sw04044-B_011560-011634 [noise]
sw04044-B_011634-011977 i was just going to say there's significantly more money uh
sw04044-B_011977-012229 and we weren't a debtor nation in those days
sw04044-B_016149-016300 well [vocalized-noise]
sw04044-B_016300-016609 i think two things have happened number one
sw04044-B_016609-016711 uh
sw04044-B_016711-016885 it's like uh
sw04044-B_016885-016996 [noise]
sw04044-B_016996-017687 pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where
sw04044-B_017687-018135 [noise] where the pay later is uh is here and [noise] and uh
sw04044-B_018237-018972 when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and
sw04044-B_018972-019620 and it just goes by pretty fast well uh the play now pay later uh
sw04044-B_019620-020338 mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh
sw04044-B_020338-020492 um
sw04044-B_020492-020860 the the debt load is way up uh
sw04044-B_020860-021078 you know in the sixties
sw04044-B_021078-021558 what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was
sw04044-B_021558-022071 was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right
sw04044-B_022071-022198 i don['t]-
sw04044-B_023596-024553 [vocalized-noise] yeah i mean well i'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh
sw04044-B_024553-025361 you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where
sw04044-B_025361-026153 where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh
sw04044-B_026153-026295 uh
sw04044-B_026295-026927 progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made
sw04044-B_026927-027599 you know the daily the minimum wage is [noise] let's see what is it when i was a [noise] i'm
sw04044-B_027703-028546 i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i [vocalized-noise] hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year
sw04044-B_028546-029109 and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh
sw04044-B_029212-029546 you know taxes on wha[t]- what i thought was a very good salary
sw04044-B_029546-029703 um
sw04044-B_029703-029962 are about the same as they are today only i'm making
sw04045-A_000000-000486 [noise] so um [noise] what do they do about recycling in Raleigh is there any public program

sw04045-A_005897-006906 and um [noise] the one nice thing though is i'm is i'm luck[y]- is i'm pretty close to downtown so um [noise] aluminum cans can be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and
sw04045-A_007008-008093 um no they don't have any deposit but um you know there's a there's a thriving industry of homeless people that [laughter] collect uh aluminum cans and turn them_1 in for you know recy[cling]- the the weight in aluminum

sw04045-A_016822-016945 um-hum
sw04045-A_017478-018828 yeah i've heard that you know a lot a lot of the you know more popular recycled materials like aluminum and um [noise] paper especially that because you know everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that
sw04045-A_018828-019971 [noise] their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries
sw04045-A_019971-020490 you can't just you know take a bunch of stuff and recycle it you generally you mix it with with new material
sw04045-A_020490-021236 and that and that you know wi[th]- you know coupled with the recession that there just isn't you know the demand for you know recycled product
sw04045-A_021765-021879 um-hum
sw04045-A_022076-022197 um-hum
sw04045-A_023595-023723 um-hum
sw04045-A_025156-025278 um
sw04045-A_026456-026928 um-hum yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle
sw04045-A_026928-028048 that they have on them but because_1 they i have a lot of friends that you know are very into recycling you know and say you know just about you know they they try and throw out as little as they can you know and and
sw04045-A_028526-028656 um-hum
sw04045-A_029152-029258 um-hum
sw04045-A_029258-029587 [laughter]
sw04045-A_029587-029773 um-hum [noise]
sw04045-B_000000-000106 [noise]
sw04045-B_000360-001437 yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city
sw04045-B_001437-002865 and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that they're recycling um
sw04045-B_002865-003734 and so you know there [laughter] really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um
sw04045-B_003734-004666 and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics
sw04045-B_004666-004918 how about_1 how about_1 in your area
sw04045-B_005424-005542 [vocalized-noise]
sw04045-B_005834-005965 right
sw04045-B_006356-006483 um-hum
sw04045-B_006683-007074 [laughter] do they have a deposit on them_1
sw04045-B_007942-009085 right right yeah because_1 uh in in places where there's a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up [laughter] which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh
sw04045-B_009085-009870 course uh now with Adopt-A-Highway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but i'm not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh
sw04045-B_010161-011315 yeah well i mean well y[eah]- yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah
sw04045-B_011315-011661 yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know
sw04045-B_012112-012703 um-hum right o[f]- of course if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do
sw04045-B_012703-013555 um now soft drink companies don't want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i don't know
sw04045-B_014012-015027 um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i- i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like
sw04045-B_015027-015809 it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago
sw04045-B_015809-016861 it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they [laughter] they they [vocalized-noise] critics start recycling before there's an industry to deal with the stuff and
sw04045-B_016861-017583 i forget where it was i think it was Portland Oregon ended up burning a bunch of it [laughter] it was just piling up and they had no where to put it
sw04045-B_018489-018610 hm
sw04045-B_019500-019625 um-hum
sw04045-B_020413-020630 right yeah i think th[at]-
sw04045-B_021166-022145 [noise] yeah well i don't yeah i don't know i guess if [vocalized-noise] as far as packaging materials are c[oncerned]- are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i
sw04045-B_022145-022894 i don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i- i- i- i- i expect it
sw04045-B_022894-023742 [laughter-well] i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money [noise] um
sw04045-B_023742-024879 but um yeah i[n]- th[e]- th[e]- the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products you're talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one
sw04045-B_024879-025349 there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things
sw04045-B_025349-026642 and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re[cycle]- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable
sw04045-B_026895-027063 um-hum
sw04045-B_027063-027219 hm
sw04045-B_027363-027481 um-hum
sw04045-B_027807-029197 yeah that's right r[ight]- right um well i'm [laughter-down] i read somebody say he was down to uh one bag of garbage a week and that's about the same with me but i'll tell you my garbage is mostly by weight is mostly junk mail
sw04045-B_029197-029773 [laughter] if i could get rid of that [laughter] it wouldn't be much at all it's just that
sw04046-A_000000-000020 [noise]
sw04046-A_000020-000255 so have you had to think about uh
sw04046-A_000255-000599 nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life
sw04046-A_000776-000915 uh-huh
sw04046-A_001112-001269 oh that's very young
sw04046-A_001539-001700 uh-huh
sw04046-A_001700-002272 uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh
sw04046-A_002272-002671 seventy and my mother must be about sixty five
sw04046-A_002671-003309 so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand
sw04046-A_003558-004584 no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um
sw04046-A_004584-005113 but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing
sw04046-A_006036-006174 [noise]
sw04046-A_006369-006855 yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something
sw04046-A_006855-007286 you know special you can't handle it anyway uh
sw04046-A_007286-007792 i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us
sw04046-A_007792-008167 but there are certain health
sw04046-A_008167-008804 you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard
sw04046-A_009665-010291 that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars
sw04046-A_010291-010466 yeah
sw04046-A_010466-010674 yeah what the heck
sw04046-A_010674-010802 yeah
sw04046-A_010994-011128 yeah its
sw04046-A_011128-011535 it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and
sw04046-A_011535-011656 uh
sw04046-A_011656-011776 yeah
sw04046-A_012499-012632 yeah
sw04046-A_013126-014088 i saw something on Six[ty]- Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece
sw04046-A_014313-015307 yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could
sw04046-A_015307-015589 put away enough money to handle it ourselves
sw04046-A_015728-016200 huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left
sw04046-A_017076-017401 well that's could be worse i think
sw04046-A_017521-017902 if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably
sw04046-A_017902-018241 yeah i- i think that might be s[ufficient]- might be sufficient
sw04046-A_019191-019331 um-hum
sw04046-A_019714-019833 [noise]
sw04046-A_019833-020364 yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh
sw04046-A_020364-020846 to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it
sw04046-A_021392-022303 well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not
sw04046-A_022706-023375 you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point
sw04046-A_023867-024592 yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh
sw04046-A_024592-025584 the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh
sw04046-A_025584-026489 everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
sw04046-A_027525-028425 yeah my wife has c[ertain]- certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they [laughter-are] [laughter] it comes time to deal with it
sw04046-A_028529-028668 uh-huh
sw04046-A_028979-029121 um-hum
sw04046-A_029614-029748 um-hum
sw04046-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04046-B_000509-001197 nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age
sw04046-B_001197-001378 yeah um
sw04046-B_001378-001613 so that really hasn't been an issue for me
sw04046-B_001613-001773 how about_1 yourself
sw04046-B_002071-002202 um-hum
sw04046-B_002583-002720 um-hum
sw04046-B_003023-003597 right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or
sw04046-B_004351-004490 um-hum
sw04046-B_004957-006125 yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home
sw04046-B_006125-006419 so it tends to be kind of useless anyway
sw04046-B_006780-006911 um-hum
sw04046-B_007065-007218 right
sw04046-B_007218-007358 yeah
sw04046-B_007689-007823 um-hum
sw04046-B_008195-008330 yeah
sw04046-B_008330-008460 right
sw04046-B_008615-008741 yeah
sw04046-B_008741-009412 i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to
sw04046-B_009412-009763 to have a nurse come into the home periodically
sw04046-B_009872-009998 yeah
sw04046-B_010138-010596 dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time
sw04046-B_010596-010737 yeah
sw04046-B_010737-010998 and certainly more dignified than uh
sw04046-B_010998-011193 than warehousing them
sw04046-B_011440-011605 right
sw04046-B_011605-011702 yeah
sw04046-B_011702-012560 it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight
sw04046-B_012560-013333 and uh you know they just really can't take care of them_1 very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run
sw04046-B_013622-013765 um-hum
sw04046-B_013985-014387 yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good
sw04046-B_015121-015291 yeah
sw04046-B_015291-015449 yeah
sw04046-B_015588-015801 yeah it seems that way
sw04046-B_016135-017160 yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead
sw04046-B_017305-017625 yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go
sw04046-B_017836-017991 i'd be happy
sw04046-B_018197-019290 yeah th[at's]- that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh
sw04046-B_019290-019985 heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for
sw04046-B_020323-020454 right
sw04046-B_020790-021503 yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree
sw04046-B_021503-021655 yeah
sw04046-B_021936-022066 yeah
sw04046-B_022190-022729 well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life
sw04046-B_022729-022855 and uh
sw04046-B_022995-023116 yeah
sw04046-B_023216-023926 yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life
sw04046-B_023926-024112 so
sw04046-B_024271-024400 uh-huh
sw04046-B_025108-025236 right
sw04046-B_025443-025576 um-hum
sw04046-B_025935-026072 right
sw04046-B_026249-026401 yeah
sw04046-B_026401-027595 seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and
sw04046-B_027595-027809 if that's the case then
sw04046-B_027918-028043 um-hum
sw04046-B_028145-028262 [laughter]
sw04046-B_028262-029702 yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something
sw04046-B_029702-029907 that they're kind of in a
sw04047-A_000000-000532 [noise] -[o]kay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh
sw04047-A_000532-001485 m[y]- my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it
sw04047-A_002200-002335 uh-huh
sw04047-A_002335-002472 uh
sw04047-A_004039-005055 yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm
sw04047-A_005055-005230 um
sw04047-A_005230-005791 i- i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but
sw04047-A_005791-006679 more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there
sw04047-A_006985-008063 yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time
sw04047-A_008063-009161 we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them_1 to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years
sw04047-A_010269-010570 i think one interesting question would be uh
sw04047-A_010570-011841 uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that
sw04047-A_011841-012283 if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this
sw04047-A_012283-012755 or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves th[e]- the death penalty
sw04047-A_012755-014001 now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty
sw04047-A_015394-016298 i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody
sw04047-A_016298-017508 that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them_1
sw04047-A_018712-018865 uh-huh
sw04047-A_019284-019967 that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh
sw04047-A_019967-020729 is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed
sw04047-A_020729-021332 but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives
sw04047-A_021332-021679 and in effect causing some of them_1 to die
sw04047-A_022669-022833 oh is that right
sw04047-A_023466-023626 uh-huh
sw04047-A_023626-023809 yeah an[d]- an[d]-
sw04047-A_024308-024444 uh-huh
sw04047-A_024444-025300 [vocalized-noise] that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something
sw04047-A_025300-025803 and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that
sw04047-A_025938-026339 well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think
sw04047-A_026339-026962 okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later bye-bye
sw04047-A_026962-027219 [noise]
sw04047-B_001412-002294 oh i believe there i[s]- you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know
sw04047-B_002294-002494 uh
sw04047-B_002494-002917 i feel like you know they need to
sw04047-B_002917-003340 instead of giving the people o[n]- on uh
sw04047-B_003340-004063 you know like death row and stuff just leaving them_1 there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it
sw04047-B_004975-005139 yeah
sw04047-B_006597-007072 yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago
sw04047-B_007845-008001 yeah
sw04047-B_008893-009072 [vocalized-noise]
sw04047-B_009072-009596 yeah that's what i think that they need to do something to change that because
sw04047-B_009596-010311 i don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know
sw04047-B_012654-012913 it sure does [vocalized-noise]
sw04047-B_013952-014827 well that not they're partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because_1 they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh
sw04047-B_014827-015462 dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get c[apital]- the capital punishment
sw04047-B_016213-016363 yeah
sw04047-B_017451-018473 oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just [laughter] take them_1 out and shoot them_1 and just you know but uh
sw04047-B_018473-018840 that's my opinion on some of the cases
sw04047-B_018840-019363 because_1 i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff

sw04047-B_023048-023610 effecting it's way down there in the high schools and stuff and
sw04047-B_023610-024408 i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty
sw04047-B_025207-025364 yeah
sw04047-B_025714-025934 [noise]

sw04047-B_026847-027035 all right bye
sw04048-A_000000-000127 [vocalized-noise]
sw04048-A_000415-001382 drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing
sw04048-A_001931-002160 oh really wh[at]-
sw04048-A_002917-003057 uh-huh
sw04048-A_003736-003953 oh they do with alcohol
sw04048-A_003953-004157 they do it with alcohol
sw04048-A_004334-004710 oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
sw04048-A_005426-005911 huh that's interesting what type of field of work are you in
sw04048-A_005911-006303 oh in the oil business okay and you work in the office around
sw04048-A_006609-007606 uh-huh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars and we work a[round]- around a lot of explosives
sw04048-A_008016-008947 yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know wor[king]- they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole
sw04048-A_008947-009650 well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous
sw04048-A_010980-011119 yeah
sw04048-A_012308-012566 now do they fire them_1 or do they
sw04048-A_013027-013185 um-hum
sw04048-A_014600-014750 uh-huh
sw04048-A_015364-015532 oh wow
sw04048-A_015819-016385 huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure becau[se]-
sw04048-A_016385-016621 [laughter-anyway] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-have] [laughter-the]
sw04048-A_016822-016984 [laughter-that's] [laughter-right]
sw04048-A_016984-017690 but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
sw04048-A_018970-019113 uh-huh
sw04048-A_019624-020027 uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the [vocalized-noise]
sw04048-A_021470-021612 uh-huh
sw04048-A_022615-022752 uh-huh
sw04048-A_023288-023525 [laughter]
sw04048-A_023525-023763 you could time it just right
sw04048-A_023763-024628 i've met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous
sw04048-A_024990-025135 huh
sw04048-A_025135-025314 that's true
sw04048-A_025922-026421 um-hum do they give any limits on alcohol or is it
sw04048-A_027537-027735 [laughter]
sw04048-A_027876-028099 [laughter]
sw04048-A_028099-028250 oh [vocalized-noise]
sw04048-A_029325-029463 uh-huh
sw04048-B_000000-000532 [noise] pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh
sw04048-B_001318-002506 yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think it's mostly for the
sw04048-B_002506-003008 the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
sw04048-B_003008-003896 but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's
sw04048-B_003896-004077 pardon
sw04048-B_004077-004426 yeah yeah they they they they'll check for alcohol
sw04048-B_004668-005495 now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
sw04048-B_005600-005776 yeah it's a
sw04048-B_005776-006148 i'm in the oil business yeah
sw04048-B_006148-006670 yeah i work in the office so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
sw04048-B_006670-006746 [laughter]
sw04048-B_007114-007290 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04048-B_007580-008111 [laughter-well] that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on [laughter]
sw04048-B_009587-009944 yeah yeah well i- i- i agree i think that uh
sw04048-B_009944-010536 you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh
sw04048-B_010536-011061 uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff
sw04048-B_011061-011462 you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh
sw04048-B_011462-012393 you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
sw04048-B_012532-013448 well see is [vocalized-noise] this is where i start [laughter-having] my problems with my company i work for a private company and and the the policy is something like
sw04048-B_013448-014654 [noise] see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
sw04048-B_014654-015423 but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
sw04048-B_015423-015800 so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos
sw04048-B_016405-016901 yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget [laughter-about] [laughter-it]
sw04048-B_016901-017055 [laughter]
sw04048-B_017408-017536 yeah
sw04048-B_017536-018214 yeah our yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to
sw04048-B_018214-019093 you know [noise] go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
sw04048-B_019093-019620 but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
sw04048-B_019843-021080 well it's [noise] it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not
sw04048-B_021080-021557 i guess i ha[ven't]- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem
sw04048-B_021557-021726 uh
sw04048-B_021726-022053 so i gue[ss]- you know i guess it works uh
sw04048-B_022053-022282 much like uh
sw04048-B_022282-022704 well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
sw04048-B_022704-023529 so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A's and B's are going to be in and next week C's and [laughter-D's] are going to come in [laughter]
sw04048-B_023529-023623 [laughter]
sw04048-B_023623-023871 yeah right right
sw04048-B_024539-025051 yeah [vocalized-noise] especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
sw04048-B_025245-025691 you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but
sw04048-B_025691-026024 not to excess in any case [laughter]
sw04048-B_026319-026839 uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do
sw04048-B_026839-027013 [noise] um
sw04048-B_027013-027307 well i- they must i mean gee whiz
sw04048-B_027307-027884 that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because_1 i- i really don't know i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
sw04048-B_027884-028058 [laughter]
sw04048-B_028058-029393 well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in Houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
sw04048-B_029393-029984 oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
sw04049-A_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04049-A_001618-001747 uh-huh
sw04049-A_004007-004642 yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company
sw04049-A_004642-005233 to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
sw04049-A_005818-005951 yeah s[o]-
sw04049-A_006975-007095 yeah
sw04049-A_007877-008000 yeah
sw04049-A_009306-009835 [vocalized-noise] have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or [vocalized-noise]
sw04049-A_009835-010101 yeah i have once too so
sw04049-A_010371-010501 yeah
sw04049-A_011662-011971 [vocalized-noise] yeah i had it during a job interview and
sw04049-A_011971-012597 i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them
sw04049-A_012597-013071 to do this and i'm just like well uh [laughter-i'm] not even going to think much about it
sw04049-A_013071-013398 if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before
sw04049-A_013398-013553 you've gotten to know me
sw04049-A_016567-016725 [vocalized-noise] uh-huh
sw04049-A_018900-019689 yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing
sw04049-A_019689-020366 i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
sw04049-A_020366-020953 and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
sw04049-A_020953-021109 yeah
sw04049-A_023162-023290 [vocalized-noise]
sw04049-A_024194-024630 well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or
sw04049-A_025111-025233 yeah
sw04049-A_026422-026545 hum
sw04049-A_026655-026752 [noise]
sw04049-A_027015-027292 i tend to to view it
sw04049-A_027292-027849 even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend
sw04049-A_027849-028871 an employer's rights as opposed to an in[dividual's]- uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
sw04049-A_028871-029645 and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
sw04049-A_029645-029939 uh and [vocalized-noise] i don't really
sw04049-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04049-B_000051-000679 well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh
sw04049-B_000679-001665 very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
sw04049-B_001665-002033 um i don't really [noise] think that it's uh
sw04049-B_002033-003307 too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh
sw04049-B_003307-004027 thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
sw04049-B_005011-005889 well i think i think wh[at]- y[ou]- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
sw04049-B_005889-007011 there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
sw04049-B_007011-007182 uh
sw04049-B_007182-007991 like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane
sw04049-B_007991-009308 but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
sw04049-B_009699-009898 uh yeah i have been
sw04049-B_009898-010028 i
sw04049-B_010028-011181 uh i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean it's [vocalized-noise] it's very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh
sw04049-B_011181-011734 [laughter] i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
sw04049-B_012538-012661 right
sw04049-B_013021-013139 yeah
sw04049-B_013362-013478 right
sw04049-B_013478-013901 right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just
sw04049-B_013901-015300 [noise] you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know
sw04049-B_015300-015579 been hired by a corporation
sw04049-B_015579-016908 which uh you know i really The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that
sw04049-B_016908-017565 i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work
sw04049-B_017565-018924 i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
sw04049-B_020044-020161 right
sw04049-B_020301-020429 right
sw04049-B_020861-021068 that's exactly right
sw04049-B_021068-022069 and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that
sw04049-B_022069-023191 that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
sw04049-B_023191-024246 well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
sw04049-B_024553-025771 uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
sw04049-B_025771-026431 and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that
sw04049-B_026431-027038 it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome [laughter] i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me
sw04049-B_028797-028935 right
sw04049-B_029596-029700 right
sw04050-A_000000-000647 [noise] oops hello i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry [laughter]

sw04050-A_029485-029818 oh [laughter] you're ready to move on to bi[g]-
sw04050-B_000000-000075 [noise] -[he]llo
sw04050-B_000515-000823 that's okay i'm Bill from Raleigh
sw04050-B_001075-001319 oh so another one from
sw04050-B_001319-001627 a different state besides Texas [laughter]
sw04050-B_002046-002193 right
sw04050-B_002512-002657 uh
sw04050-B_002657-003437 yes and no it wasn't really a fa[mily]- a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
sw04050-B_003719-004425 it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i- i kind of know how to do [laughter-these] [laughter-things] i used to you know
sw04050-B_005281-005750 usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
sw04050-B_005750-006502 and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
sw04050-B_006502-007040 and they show up and all their kids and then a[ll]- she has uh i have
sw04050-B_007040-007648 like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
sw04050-B_007648-008313 they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
sw04050-B_009182-009863 um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone
sw04050-B_009863-010374 you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
sw04050-B_010374-010789 i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh
sw04050-B_010789-011483 for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh
sw04050-B_011483-011993 each one of the everybody that showed up do[nated]- donated some money for the rent and for
sw04050-B_011993-012909 for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill [vocalized-noise] each person in the family you know brought a dish or some [noise]
sw04050-B_013324-013890 it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
sw04050-B_014009-014122 yeah
sw04050-B_014122-014695 and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
sw04050-B_014844-015058 uh she's eighty six
sw04050-B_015320-015692 now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
sw04050-B_015692-016339 and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact [laughter]
sw04050-B_016739-017175 oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
sw04050-B_017175-017268 [laughter]
sw04050-B_020979-022307 uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county [laughter] so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
sw04050-B_022307-022802 it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
sw04050-B_024538-024902 i would say you're spread out then [laughter]
sw04050-B_024902-025770 uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because_1 my dad was in the Army and we w[ere]-
sw04050-B_025770-026686 we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to Carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in Anson County [laughter]
sw04050-B_026686-027732 i live in Raleigh and then my my parents live in Greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville so i mean we're we're
sw04050-B_027732-028350 we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro so
sw04050-B_028350-029216 nobody moves away except us [laughter] yeah i got out as soon as i graduated [laughter]
sw04050-B_029216-029637 just like this town is too small for me good-bye [laughter]
sw04051-A_000000-000152 [noise] okay_1 you wanna start
sw04051-A_002860-002988 uh-huh
sw04051-A_003091-003524 yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago
sw04051-A_006108-006433 uh-huh so have they stopped that practice now
sw04051-A_009010-009298 [noise]
sw04051-A_009298-009412 yeah yeah
sw04051-A_010048-010243 [noise]
sw04051-A_010520-010684 [noise]
sw04051-A_013856-013966 oh
sw04051-A_015268-015383 uh-huh
sw04051-A_015847-015971 [laughter-yeah]
sw04051-A_018418-018529 uh-huh
sw04051-A_018529-018663 [laughter]
sw04051-A_020748-020947 um yeah
sw04051-A_020947-021777 yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark
sw04051-A_021777-022450 smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me
sw04051-A_022776-022900 uh-huh
sw04051-A_025106-025239 oh
sw04051-A_026249-026348 um-hum
sw04051-A_026799-026948 yeah
sw04051-A_028602-028751 oh i see
sw04051-A_029408-029507 um-hum
sw04051-A_029507-029592 uh-huh
sw04051-B_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04051-B_000061-001107 yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
sw04051-B_001107-002032 uh [vocalized-noise] uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre[on]- different types of freons
sw04051-B_002032-002947 and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
sw04051-B_003415-004770 right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know che[ap]- inexpensive and lots of it
sw04051-B_004770-005899 uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
sw04051-B_006098-006230 so
sw04051-B_006335-007410 well [vocalized-noise] course there's only a a [laughter] tremendous number of a refrigerators and fre[on]- excuse me refrigerators and freezers
sw04051-B_007410-008621 both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with ni[neteen]- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems
sw04051-B_008621-009222 but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
sw04051-B_009325-009741 and that's got me very con[cerned]- you know highly concerned that uh
sw04051-B_009741-009881 [noise]
sw04051-B_009881-010131 it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
sw04051-B_010131-011326 undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
sw04051-B_011326-012502 so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh
sw04051-B_012502-013884 have us uh as a an un[employed]- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
sw04051-B_014000-014810 because as i say there is a there's a tremen[dous]- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
sw04051-B_014810-015314 and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
sw04051-B_015314-015901 and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
sw04051-B_016005-016963 i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
sw04051-B_016963-018445 and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
sw04051-B_018445-018592 and [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
sw04051-B_018592-019065 so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towar[ds]- towards uh
sw04051-B_019065-020207 uh and that's a pollu[ting]- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and
sw04051-B_020207-020810 the those two mixed together with with water and uh [noise] really make a uh make a mess
sw04051-B_021726-021872 um-hum
sw04051-B_022128-022225 right
sw04051-B_022225-022361 well most
sw04051-B_022361-023420 most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
sw04051-B_023420-024318 uh because when you when d[iesel]- diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
sw04051-B_024318-025174 that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
sw04051-B_025174-025739 because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
sw04051-B_025739-026011 because_1 diesel oil is uh
sw04051-B_026011-026223 [laughter-is] [laughter-not] [laughter-very] volatile
sw04051-B_026323-026862 you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
sw04051-B_026862-027224 diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
sw04051-B_027224-028008 and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
sw04051-B_028008-028637 normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
sw04051-B_028637-029551 as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
sw04051-B_029551-029952 and so if i[t]- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
sw04052-A_000000-000299 [noise] so um do you have children of your own
sw04052-A_000299-000486 uh how old are they
sw04052-A_000768-001303 ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself
sw04052-A_001303-001441 uh
sw04052-A_001561-001693 uh-huh
sw04052-A_001693-002055 uh that certainly is the most straightforward
sw04052-A_002055-002231 yeah
sw04052-A_002231-003038 i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh we're expecting another in May
sw04052-A_003198-004001 no not yet al[though]- my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool
sw04052-A_004001-004476 a couple of hours a day for the older one next year
sw04052-A_004476-004659 uh
sw04052-A_004659-005400 just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby
sw04052-A_005400-006280 uh but otherwise i- i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh
sw04052-A_006280-006546 major disadvantages
sw04052-A_007199-007328 um-hum
sw04052-A_007635-007766 um-hum
sw04052-A_008943-009294 [noise] yes that's true that's true uh
sw04052-A_009294-009838 and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age [laughter]
sw04052-A_009952-010623 yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh h[ow]- how old are your kids when they started some sort of school
sw04052-A_011247-011373 um-hum
sw04052-A_011585-011744 um
sw04052-A_011744-011910 uh-huh
sw04052-A_012511-012640 uh-huh
sw04052-A_012999-013130 uh-huh
sw04052-A_013130-013282 uh-huh
sw04052-A_013646-014283 yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool
sw04052-A_014283-014948 maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because_1 they would take turns
sw04052-A_014948-015098 um
sw04052-A_015351-015480 uh-huh
sw04052-A_015666-016072 [laughter-oh] so that's quite a spread twenty four to five
sw04052-A_016072-016330 wow that's great
sw04052-A_016654-016826 um
sw04052-A_016826-017600 so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home
sw04052-A_017762-017917 uh-huh
sw04052-A_017917-018195 what kind of what's their relationship like
sw04052-A_018195-018317 uh-huh
sw04052-A_018418-018572 it would be
sw04052-A_018572-018951 very intere[sting]- i mean old enough i mean really
sw04052-A_018951-019384 [vocalized-noise] no sibling rivalry there i would expect [laughter]
sw04052-A_019522-019657 uh-huh
sw04052-A_019848-019969 uh-huh
sw04052-A_020318-020739 oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle
sw04052-A_020739-020897 uh
sw04052-A_020897-021156 hold it no that child is
sw04052-A_021156-021424 wait a minute this should be very simple
sw04052-A_021424-021712 that child is your son's nephew
sw04052-A_021712-022346 that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat
sw04052-A_022463-022636 yeah
sw04052-A_022636-023301 uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle [laughter] whose about forty years older
sw04052-A_023301-023441 um
sw04052-A_023666-023834 um
sw04052-A_023834-024028 do you plan to have more children
sw04052-A_024028-024303 [laughter] all said
sw04052-A_024303-024446 um
sw04052-A_024719-025198 oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby
sw04052-A_025470-025632 oh well
sw04052-A_025632-026092 well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care
sw04052-A_026553-026684 uh-huh
sw04052-A_027247-027416 oh it sounds great
sw04052-A_027518-027645 uh-huh
sw04052-A_027849-028252 yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid
sw04052-A_028252-028463 [laughter]
sw04052-A_028463-028632 um
sw04052-A_028632-028898 but it is nice to i mean i- i find it
sw04052-A_028898-029200 it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home
sw04052-A_029200-029587 with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting
sw04052-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04052-B_000211-000339 yes
sw04052-B_000441-000877 they range in age from twenty four down to five
sw04052-B_001167-001656 n[ot]- not really my wife has provided the child care up to now
sw04052-B_001925-002131 [laughter-that's] the easiest one
sw04052-B_002131-002328 do you have children
sw04052-B_003021-003279 and have you been into child care
sw04052-B_004394-004501 uh-huh
sw04052-B_005316-005449 right
sw04052-B_006513-007739 well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes
sw04052-B_007739-009019 uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lo[t]- i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids
sw04052-B_009492-010124 me too [laughter] the last thing they need at that age is academics [laughter]
sw04052-B_010632-011338 well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in Texas
sw04052-B_011338-011839 and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure
sw04052-B_011839-012053 with the others we've either
sw04052-B_012053-012249 with some friends done a
sw04052-B_012249-012584 a sort of Mother's Day out kind of thing where they took turns
sw04052-B_012584-013686 a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief
sw04052-B_014241-014358 yeah
sw04052-B_015098-015849 we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know i'm [laughter-ready] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-break] [laughter]
sw04052-B_015993-016220 oh we have eight children so
sw04052-B_016220-016728 there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them
sw04052-B_017556-018004 uh she was in college actually when the baby was born
sw04052-B_018116-018311 very good
sw04052-B_018311-018448 oh
sw04052-B_019148-019968 no and she kind of really wanted him [laughter] i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it
sw04052-B_019968-020454 and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is
sw04052-B_021420-021608 my son is a
sw04052-B_021608-021820 yeah right
sw04052-B_022263-022689 well we didn't quite make that but came [laughter-close] [laughter-so] [laughter-it] [laughter-doesn't]
sw04052-B_023044-023207 yeah
sw04052-B_023207-023364 yeah
sw04052-B_023966-024196 no [laughter]
sw04052-B_024312-024787 now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better
sw04052-B_025141-025369 they live about uh
sw04052-B_025369-025722 four hours from here they're in San Antonio
sw04052-B_025722-025867 yeah
sw04052-B_026096-026701 uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still
sw04052-B_026701-027330 and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening
sw04052-B_027330-027897 so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it
sw04052-B_028192-028532 a[nd]- me too [laughter]
sw04052-B_029505-029795 i don't know what you hear in California but you know there's a lot of [vocalized-noise]
sw04053-A_000000-000319 [noise] do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly
sw04053-A_000319-000645 [laughter] do you uh how often
sw04053-A_000855-000986 well that's good
sw04053-A_000986-001083 that's good
sw04053-A_001227-001391 do you walk very far
sw04053-A_001523-001662 yeah well that's
sw04053-A_001662-001907 that's not bad i mean

sw04053-A_006954-007077 i [vocalized-noise]
sw04053-A_007378-007536 it's tough
sw04053-A_007536-007697 [laughter-it] is
sw04053-A_009174-009283 um-hum
sw04053-A_010062-010914 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] i bet well did you do you like the rowi[ng]- rowing machine because i did that for a while and
sw04053-A_010914-011354 i- i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me
sw04053-A_011354-011842 and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but
sw04053-A_011842-012244 i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe
sw04053-A_012244-012393 maybe for my arms
sw04053-A_012884-012996 um-hum
sw04053-A_013190-013260 yeah
sw04053-A_013514-013630 yeah
sw04053-A_014854-014970 yeah
sw04053-A_015077-015148 [laughter]
sw04053-A_015148-015799 well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise
sw04053-A_016128-016208 yeah
sw04053-A_018367-018483 yeah
sw04053-A_019652-019807 ah
sw04053-A_019807-020444 yeah well i- i run after preschoolers [laughter] at this point so
sw04053-A_020661-020942 [laughter] yeah
sw04053-A_021062-021405 well uh yes and no i mean i don't
sw04053-A_021405-022134 i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel like you know i've i've
sw04053-A_022134-023357 really worked out but i- i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so
sw04053-A_023357-024429 but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it an[d]- i an[d]- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um
sw04053-A_024429-024566 right now i'm
sw04053-A_024566-025317 you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um
sw04053-A_025317-025446 so that's
sw04053-A_025446-026320 you know and i only have a certain [laughter-amount] of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so
sw04053-A_027056-027726 yeah um i- i'm a member of President's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've
sw04053-A_027726-028713 you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um
sw04053-A_028713-029853 biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and so it's
sw04053-B_000128-000291 [laughter]
sw04053-B_000291-000397 i walk
sw04053-B_000652-000895 uh about every other day
sw04053-B_001000-001070 no
sw04053-B_001070-001237 that's not very much really
sw04053-B_001378-001531 uh a couple miles
sw04053-B_003640-003930 ha[ve]- have you done that a long time
sw04053-B_006918-007136 that sounds pretty good you're
sw04053-B_007136-007346 you're better than i am i uh
sw04053-B_007475-007618 [laughter]
sw04053-B_007618-008467 i- i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh [noise]
sw04053-B_008467-008934 uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh
sw04053-B_009049-009688 {exercycles} but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and
sw04053-B_009688-010153 uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move
sw04053-B_010828-011006 no i didn't like that
sw04053-B_012102-012575 i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the
sw04053-B_012575-012902 the main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable
sw04053-B_012902-013012 and uh
sw04053-B_013012-013570 walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i- i bicycle once in a while
sw04053-B_013570-013879 but if it's any kind of equipment then uh
sw04053-B_014011-014379 i have uh four kids at home and and
sw04053-B_014379-014882 they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings
sw04053-B_014882-015190 and it takes me a while to get back into it so
sw04053-B_015713-016261 well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is
sw04053-B_016261-016912 is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh
sw04053-B_016912-017315 uh a couple of people in my group who we just
sw04053-B_017315-017584 take off and walk uh
sw04053-B_017704-017993 uh over to the shopping center and
sw04053-B_017993-018402 walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip
sw04053-B_018508-018833 so it's but it's a kind of sedentary job here
sw04053-B_018833-019067 i don't know about you but uh
sw04053-B_019067-019201 uh
sw04053-B_019302-019857 this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs
sw04053-B_020311-020700 is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than
sw04053-B_020700-020839 than uh
sw04053-B_020839-021119 that's a fair amount of exercise by itself right
sw04053-B_026149-027086 are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it
sw04054-A_000000-000025 [noise]
sw04054-A_000025-000273 okay well hello Frances
sw04054-A_000273-000698 um [noise] yeah i guess when i uh
sw04054-A_000698-001059 first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh
sw04054-A_001059-001686 subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh
sw04054-A_001686-001836 [noise]
sw04054-A_001836-002004 screening uh
sw04054-A_002004-002393 uh screening for potential problems [noise]
sw04054-A_002393-003178 good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh
sw04054-A_003178-004710 well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the
sw04054-A_004710-005279 the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis
sw04054-A_006931-007065 yeah
sw04054-A_009287-009431 uh-huh
sw04054-A_009752-010686 [noise] yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with
sw04054-A_010686-011801 employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it
sw04054-A_011801-012134 one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh
sw04054-A_012134-012787 [noise] there's they most of them don't test for
sw04054-A_012787-013339 actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse
sw04054-A_013339-013776 and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh
sw04054-A_013887-014744 i- i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country
sw04054-A_014744-015614 so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are of you know are the ones that they focus on
sw04054-A_017617-017709 [noise]
sw04054-A_017709-018495 well see now in Texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago
sw04054-A_019369-019518 oh really
sw04054-A_020415-020580 oh [laughter-man]
sw04054-A_020580-020726 [laughter]
sw04054-A_021040-021198 yeah
sw04054-A_021198-021342 uh-huh
sw04054-A_021605-021762 right yeah
sw04054-A_022296-022728 yeah i expect possibly in Texas it's uh
sw04054-A_022728-023644 you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter]
sw04054-A_023644-023826 [laughter]
sw04054-A_023977-024545 yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the [laughter-highway]
sw04054-A_025560-025694 uh-huh
sw04054-A_025922-026052 um
sw04054-A_026609-026751 uh-huh
sw04054-A_027292-027413 um-hum

sw04054-B_005233-005508 well the reliability seems to
sw04054-B_005508-005600 [laughter]
sw04054-B_005600-005997 not be too great um
sw04054-B_006218-006338 i don't know
sw04054-B_006338-006405 [noise]
sw04054-B_006405-007305 i'm kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think i'm for it [laughter] uh [laughter] i really do um
sw04054-B_007305-007633 because we lose so much
sw04054-B_007633-008037 time and what have you with the the drug problem
sw04054-B_008037-008387 and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh
sw04054-B_008532-009041 i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh
sw04054-B_009041-009358 have some kind of guidelines to go by
sw04054-B_009358-009773 but like anything else this can be misused
sw04054-B_011722-011860 uh-huh
sw04054-B_013233-013400 [noise] right
sw04054-B_014713-014835 [noise]
sw04054-B_015551-016013 [noise] well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is
sw04054-B_016013-016924 more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more
sw04054-B_016924-017763 harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh
sw04054-B_018454-019450 yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again
sw04054-B_019450-020576 this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two DWI's
sw04054-B_020576-021073 and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone
sw04054-B_021073-022351 and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh
sw04054-B_022811-023034 the good old [noise]
sw04054-B_023435-024189 yeah good old boy stuff [laughter] you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect [laughter]
sw04054-B_024333-025597 [laughter] yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may become that with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's they use cocaine
sw04054-B_025597-026127 and it's acc[eptable]- it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not
sw04054-B_026127-026967 they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this [laughter-before] and i'm afraid that's what we may be
sw04054-B_026967-027338 facing in the very near future
sw04054-B_027629-028723 other than that i don't know because i don't [laughter-drink] [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-do] [laughter-drugs] [laughter] and it's uh so neither is really acceptable to me [laughter]
sw04054-B_028723-029984 but uh then the work place it's just [laughter] i don't know what is well we really infringing on others' rights or their

sw04055-A_007272-008578 on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains

sw04055-B_011162-011929 what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves
sw04055-B_012894-013021 um-hum
sw04055-B_014272-014681 uh-huh o[f]- course i imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah
sw04055-B_014681-014944 it doesn't get very cold in Texas
sw04055-B_014944-015251 so lots of times we don't even take tents
sw04055-B_015251-015489 we just use trail tarps
sw04055-B_015696-016188 uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of
sw04055-B_016188-016637 uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
sw04055-B_016637-017262 uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them_1 when we go backpacking
sw04055-B_017262-017979 so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them_1 with you and
sw04055-B_017979-018225 they'll keep you dry or whatever
sw04055-B_020098-020202 um-hum
sw04055-B_021351-021917 ye[s]- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
sw04055-B_021917-022328 uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere
sw04055-B_022328-023382 uh [laughter] so uh but it [vocalized-noise] even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting
sw04055-B_023382-023606 but we got to see a lot of deer
sw04055-B_023606-025014 um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
sw04055-B_025014-025434 because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is
sw04055-B_025657-025790 um-hum
sw04055-B_025790-026197 and possums and uh raccoons
sw04055-B_026197-026666 and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh
sw04055-B_026666-027000 they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack
sw04055-B_027149-027555 and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
sw04055-B_027952-028230 they will if you attack them
sw04055-B_028230-028481 but most time they run away from you
sw04055-B_028481-028798 if y[ou]- if they s[ee]- if they see you're up you know
sw04055-B_028798-029149 [noise] but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep
sw04055-B_029314-029430 so
sw04055-B_029430-029529 [noise]
sw04056-A_000000-000025 [noise]
sw04056-A_000025-000200 okay should begin
sw04056-A_000200-000319 uh
sw04056-A_000319-000705 i can begin this um basically i work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
sw04056-A_000705-001616 and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical
sw04056-A_001616-002341 uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself
sw04056-A_002341-002550 um what's your situation
sw04056-A_002689-002799 oh
sw04056-A_003918-004050 um-hum
sw04056-A_004050-004241 are you a professor there
sw04056-A_005048-005298 oh i see okay
sw04056-A_006301-006547 oh no doubt [laughter]
sw04056-A_007370-007967 right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about Honeywell is uh
sw04056-A_008069-008471 i used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a uh
sw04056-A_008471-008815 a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
sw04056-A_008815-009200 but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year
sw04056-A_009200-010151 so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so
sw04056-A_010151-011158 that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
sw04056-A_011935-012007 um-hum
sw04056-A_012517-012627 yeah
sw04056-A_013500-014515 yeah i don't know if you saw on Twenty Twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
sw04056-A_014515-014993 it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh
sw04056-A_014993-015275 oh all the different uh
sw04056-A_015275-015538 med[ical]- medical maladies that you can have
sw04056-A_015538-016538 and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would
sw04056-A_016538-017100 so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck
sw04056-A_017100-017357 but um it [vocalized-noise] was an interesting show
sw04056-A_017357-017716 i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing
sw04056-A_017716-018469 uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be
sw04056-A_018469-018577 um
sw04056-A_018577-019416 just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
sw04056-A_019416-020182 but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it
sw04056-A_021331-021438 um
sw04056-A_022165-022300 great
sw04056-A_022561-022999 is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh
sw04056-A_022999-023622 professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or
sw04056-A_024663-024780 right
sw04056-A_025017-025114 um-hum
sw04056-A_025634-025721 uh-huh
sw04056-A_026184-026332 oh okay
sw04056-A_026843-026949 right
sw04056-A_027162-027709 yeah i'm kind of interested because_1 i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree
sw04056-A_027709-027963 is to uh is to teach in university
sw04056-A_027963-028215 i'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
sw04056-A_028215-028337 but um
sw04056-A_028337-029047 yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
sw04056-A_029565-029726 oh is that right
sw04056-B_000000-000057 [noise]
sw04056-B_000057-000248 okay all right
sw04056-B_000629-000763 uh-huh
sw04056-B_001595-001709 uh-huh
sw04056-B_002260-002405 uh-huh
sw04056-B_002405-002791 i- i work for the University of New Hampshire and uh
sw04056-B_002791-003982 our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi[cal]- or the dental
sw04056-B_003982-004176 uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04056-B_004176-005195 no i work in i'm in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i uh effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire
sw04056-B_005195-005972 uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh
sw04056-B_005972-006429 the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get
sw04056-B_006429-007432 we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off
sw04056-B_007539-007636 yeah
sw04056-B_008757-008894 right
sw04056-B_009156-009274 uh-huh
sw04056-B_010094-010196 um-hum
sw04056-B_011140-011966 well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit
sw04056-B_011966-012511 and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh
sw04056-B_012511-013551 you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part
sw04056-B_014055-014172 uh-huh
sw04056-B_014172-014295 right
sw04056-B_015549-015647 oh yeah
sw04056-B_015918-016022 um-hum
sw04056-B_016498-016599 huh
sw04056-B_017041-017154 uh-huh
sw04056-B_017326-017422 hum
sw04056-B_017659-017787 right
sw04056-B_018790-018907 right
sw04056-B_019374-019496 um-hum
sw04056-B_020128-021365 well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
sw04056-B_021365-022192 but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
sw04056-B_022192-022651 and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
sw04056-B_023510-024199 uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operat[ing]- for what we call operating staff which are
sw04056-B_024199-025029 considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to
sw04056-B_025029-025704 and but the main i think the hea[lth]- the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but
sw04056-B_025704-026247 the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued
sw04056-B_026247-026870 uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there
sw04056-B_026870-027198 uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get
sw04056-B_027663-027780 um-hum
sw04056-B_027906-028028 uh-huh
sw04056-B_028148-028266 oh
sw04056-B_028943-029630 college programs uh belong to this T I A A uh C R E F uh retirement fund
sw04056-B_029630-029917 right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh
sw04057-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04057-A_000011-000173 all right uh
sw04057-A_000504-000669 excuse me
sw04057-A_000669-000822 yeah
sw04057-A_001251-001411 [laughter-okay]
sw04057-A_001411-001596 all right so uh
sw04057-A_002104-002292 yeah i
sw04057-A_002292-002442 yeah
sw04057-A_002758-003098 oh you think y[ou]- that we are paying too much
sw04057-A_003098-003285 in taxes
sw04057-A_003887-004014 um-hum
sw04057-A_004138-004569 yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income
sw04057-A_004721-005183 right a[re]- are you you're a na[tive]- you're from uh the United States
sw04057-A_005367-005663 but you worked over there for a couple of year
sw04057-A_006131-006267 yes
sw04057-A_006905-007046 [laughter]
sw04057-A_008883-009489 right you talking about special projects in the U[S]- in the US you mean now
sw04057-A_009489-010712 okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that
sw04057-A_010712-011173 um for what we get we're paying too much i would say
sw04057-A_011405-011889 right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted
sw04057-A_011889-012984 for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh mon[ey]- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste
sw04057-A_014317-014632 right right typically um
sw04057-A_014632-014877 you don't get a whole lot [laughter]
sw04057-A_017109-018208 well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that
sw04057-A_018208-018823 if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare
sw04057-A_018823-019478 so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system
sw04057-A_019478-019906 you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off
sw04057-A_021513-021659 yes
sw04057-A_021933-022974 well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because_1 there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure
sw04057-A_022974-023125 uh-huh
sw04057-A_023125-023288 yeah
sw04057-A_024691-024819 right
sw04057-A_025140-025260 hm
sw04057-A_025774-025917 yes
sw04057-A_026129-026265 yeah
sw04057-A_026265-026408 um-hum
sw04057-A_026408-027050 yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta
sw04057-A_027050-028173 and we get taxed t[remendously]- tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was
sw04057-A_028173-028838 um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of
sw04057-A_028838-029191 indigent people are go and get free care
sw04057-A_029191-030048 and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i- i and a lot of other thing[s]-
sw04057-B_000000-000107 [noise]
sw04057-B_000248-000519 did you uh did you have to wait very long
sw04057-B_000519-000775 did you have to wait very long
sw04057-B_000775-001318 oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number
sw04057-B_001318-001425 [laughter]
sw04057-B_001425-001534 they had
sw04057-B_001534-001628 [laughter]
sw04057-B_001628-001985 are Americans still paying too much too many taxes
sw04057-B_001985-002422 that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this
sw04057-B_002422-002803 well no [laughter] i mean yes [laughter]
sw04057-B_003141-003579 yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh
sw04057-B_003579-004223 i think we're paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do
sw04057-B_004421-004812 yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is
sw04057-B_005134-005483 yes i i'm from Idaho actually
sw04057-B_005483-006209 yeah yeah i wa[s]- so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an im[pression]- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic
sw04057-B_006209-006970 and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much
sw04057-B_006970-007750 i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um
sw04057-B_007912-008959 things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that
sw04057-B_008959-009148 it
sw04057-B_009294-009407 [noise]
sw04057-B_009407-009585 right
sw04057-B_011085-011499 you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it
sw04057-B_011888-012040 i can go
sw04057-B_013021-013815 yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket
sw04057-B_013815-013947 so
sw04057-B_013947-014381 um it seems very expensive to me for what i get
sw04057-B_014834-016160 no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
sw04057-B_016160-016471 and uh welfare on
sw04057-B_016471-016834 reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on
sw04057-B_016834-017187 and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on
sw04057-B_019959-020101 huh
sw04057-B_020101-020400 don't know if i agree with that or not
sw04057-B_020400-021311 i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason
sw04057-B_021311-021632 although two years that does sound like quite a while
sw04057-B_021632-021876 i don't know what do you think of that one
sw04057-B_022936-023242 he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue
sw04057-B_023242-024362 um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can
sw04057-B_024362-024754 see if he can uh give the line item veto a try
sw04057-B_024754-025211 and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while
sw04057-B_025211-026123 but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that
sw04057-B_026123-026365 that'd be quite an exciting battle
sw04057-B_026977-027110 uh-huh
sw04057-B_029131-029263 uh-huh
sw04058-A_000000-000183 [noise] okay_1 Toby this is Brian White
sw04058-A_000183-000828 and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that um
sw04058-A_000828-001150 if you don't mind uh how do you feel about capital punishment
sw04058-A_001877-001985 okay
sw04058-A_003408-003511 uh-huh
sw04058-A_004939-005048 uh-huh

sw04058-A_015440-015563 right
sw04058-A_016250-016388 yes
sw04058-A_016993-018430 right right i tend to agree with you uh i'm kind of uh torn between two items however i i definitely bel[ieve]- believe in due process that if a person is found guilty
sw04058-A_018430-019191 so that we're not ramrodding a a guilty verdict on them that it's uh up for review in uh the appeal process
sw04058-A_019191-019968 however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that
sw04058-A_019968-021448 there are people that are going to make sure that every T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now
sw04058-A_021448-021804 not only in the courts is that costing us
sw04058-A_021804-022716 money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and uh clogging up the courts but also
sw04058-A_022716-022953 when the [vocalized-noise] uh
sw04058-A_022953-024117 the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh
sw04058-A_024117-025203 in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um
sw04058-A_025203-025302 the[y]-
sw04058-A_025302-025640 yeah exactly [laughter] exactly
sw04058-A_025640-026722 and the guy is as sound mind and and so forth he's he's not an idiot uh he wasn't acting i- i don't know you know in that case
sw04058-A_026722-027692 we're we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information
sw04058-A_027692-028449 and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly
sw04058-A_028449-029400 that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels app[eal]- of appeal
sw04058-A_029400-029723 uh under cert[ain]- certain circumstances
sw04058-A_029723-029917 those circumstances would be
sw04058-B_000000-000059 [noise]
sw04058-B_001149-001935 well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered
sw04058-B_001935-002132 um [noise]
sw04058-B_002132-003556 it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh
sw04058-B_003556-004583 if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a
sw04058-B_004583-005187 a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done
sw04058-B_005447-006894 that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality
sw04058-B_006894-007076 everybody knows he did it
sw04058-B_007076-008485 this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh ex[plaining]- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be
sw04058-B_008485-009571 and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision
sw04058-B_009571-010082 uh [noise] they did it wrong [laughter] and it was just a very minor
sw04058-B_010082-011412 very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again
sw04058-B_011412-012183 that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me
sw04058-B_012183-012363 and with [noise]
sw04058-B_012363-012674 uh with with it being that way
sw04058-B_012674-013762 it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it
sw04058-B_013762-014174 the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead
sw04058-B_014174-015006 here in Georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole
sw04058-B_015006-015504 if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well
sw04058-B_015504-015999 and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder
sw04058-B_015999-016125 uh
sw04058-B_016125-017066 that just shouldn't be so [vocalized-noise] but [vocalized-noise] so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole
sw04058-B_021277-021398 yeah
sw04058-B_021398-021548 [noise]
sw04058-B_025178-025351 there's video tape of it
sw04058-B_025351-025496 [laughter]
sw04058-B_026470-026596 yeah
sw04058-B_029701-029805 um-hum
sw04059-A_000000-000170 [noise]
sw04059-A_000170-000550 well [noise] my parents were both in them_1
sw04059-A_000550-000993 and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make
sw04059-A_000993-001368 because boy it really confines the uh the people
sw04059-A_001368-001573 and uh
sw04059-A_001731-002196 usually they don't care for it [noise] and kind of put you on a guilt trip
sw04059-A_002196-002498 but uh have you had any experience with them_1
sw04059-A_003296-003419 yeah
sw04059-A_004786-004909 yeah
sw04059-A_005194-005490 but it's still still not like home
sw04059-A_005490-005668 [noise]
sw04059-A_006111-006229 right
sw04059-A_006783-006903 yeah
sw04059-A_007094-007415 but uh you know and it's hard to really
sw04059-A_007415-007725 know what kind of a home is run
sw04059-A_007725-008015 unless you really know someone that's in there
sw04059-A_008119-008211 and
sw04059-A_008211-008317 [noise]
sw04059-A_008317-008634 you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too
sw04059-A_008634-009047 that uh [noise] yeah they may say it's real bad
sw04059-A_009047-009447 uh just because they don't like it in there
sw04059-A_009447-009774 whereas it's you know usually pretty good
sw04059-A_009774-010281 uh [noise] uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh
sw04059-A_010281-010976 oh God [vocalized-noise] entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever
sw04059-A_010976-011108 yeah
sw04059-A_011108-011903 and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it
sw04059-A_011903-012227 because they don't eat that too well
sw04059-A_012344-012536 and uh
sw04059-A_012536-012973 go uh a[lways]- you always have to check it for cleanliness too
sw04059-A_012973-013294 well you have to make sure they're clean
sw04059-A_013294-013782 and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here
sw04059-A_013782-014058 where the guy's suing the nursing home
sw04059-A_014058-014311 he came in at ten in the morning
sw04059-A_014311-014484 check on his mom
sw04059-A_014591-014815 and she was sick
sw04059-A_014815-015448 and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said wha[t]- is she sick
sw04059-A_015448-015607 we didn't know that
sw04059-A_015607-015847 and here she died two hours later
sw04059-A_015847-015965 yeah
sw04059-A_015965-016279 so you know
sw04059-A_016279-016761 and [noise] w[ell]- there's an awful lot of variables in them_1
sw04059-A_019674-019806 oh
sw04059-A_020331-020692 well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh
sw04059-A_020692-020955 kind of tightening up on it
sw04059-A_020955-021148 but uh
sw04059-A_021365-021752 you know in some of them_1 some of them_1 try so d[arn]- hard
sw04059-A_021752-022172 but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful
sw04059-A_022172-022433 is ever ending
sw04059-A_022433-022624 [noise]
sw04059-A_024363-024656 well it's around the clock care
sw04059-A_024877-025101 yeah an awful lot
sw04059-A_025219-025463 and and gentleness too
sw04059-A_026753-026901 yeah
sw04059-A_028985-029168 costs a bunch
sw04059-A_029168-029467 my mother-in-law is uh eighty two
sw04059-A_029611-029840 and we'd probably put her in the same home that
sw04059-B_000000-000146 [noise] think about what nursing home
sw04059-B_000540-000662 uh-huh
sw04059-B_000915-001051 yeah
sw04059-B_001321-001442 um-hum
sw04059-B_002103-002238 yeah
sw04059-B_002448-003362 well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home
sw04059-B_003362-004202 and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing
sw04059-B_004202-004417 and uh it's uh
sw04059-B_004417-004898 i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh
sw04059-B_004898-005257 and a lot more personal but uh
sw04059-B_005551-006314 no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen
sw04059-B_006314-006850 people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home
sw04059-B_006850-007058 that seems to be
sw04059-B_007058-007215 uh
sw04059-B_007719-007844 yeah
sw04059-B_007997-008116 yeah
sw04059-B_008590-008704 yeah
sw04059-B_009439-009549 yeah
sw04059-B_010602-010731 uh-huh
sw04059-B_010915-011050 well that's good
sw04059-B_011850-011969 yeah
sw04059-B_012161-012277 yeah
sw04059-B_012613-012762 [noise]
sw04059-B_012935-013098 i'm sorry what was that
sw04059-B_013217-013363 oh yeah
sw04059-B_013756-013863 um-hum
sw04059-B_014441-014553 um-hum
sw04059-B_015600-015750 [noise]
sw04059-B_015750-015946 uh oh
sw04059-B_016714-017117 yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh
sw04059-B_017117-017601 i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was
sw04059-B_017702-018535 i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh
sw04059-B_018535-019096 kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was
sw04059-B_019199-020071 it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in Atlanta that are closing down [noise] it's
sw04059-B_020071-020328 apparently a shaky business right now
sw04059-B_020901-021033 yeah
sw04059-B_022124-022245 yeah
sw04059-B_022365-022886 yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently
sw04059-B_022886-023384 showing some signs of Alzheimer's and uh she'll
sw04059-B_023384-024464 my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so
sw04059-B_024568-024948 yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience
sw04059-B_025184-025294 but
sw04059-B_025443-026015 yeah she [laughter] she's she's pretty good with them_1 though she does a real good job
sw04059-B_026015-026830 and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed
sw04059-B_026830-027048 you know which is good
sw04059-B_027048-027768 so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh
sw04059-B_027768-028064 uh i i don't think i would
sw04059-B_028064-028193 wanna
sw04059-B_028193-028881 turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and [vocalized-noise] i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it
sw04059-B_028881-029003 you know
sw04060-A_000000-000082 [noise]
sw04060-A_000082-000288 okay Karen you're [vocalized-noise] you're first
sw04060-A_000994-001132 uh-huh
sw04060-A_001954-002077 okay
sw04060-A_002077-002793 yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh
sw04060-A_002793-003251 there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh
sw04060-A_003251-003885 quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a
sw04060-A_003885-004097 progressive path but
sw04060-A_004097-004267 not being in the
sw04060-A_004267-004713 say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
sw04060-A_004713-004883 uh like
sw04060-A_004883-005022 really [vocalized-noise]
sw04060-A_005542-006196 yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh
sw04060-A_006196-006561 a broader scope for rewarding people for
sw04060-A_006561-006781 uh their performances
sw04060-A_006781-007035 um so that's
sw04060-A_007035-007462 in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution
sw04060-A_007462-007897 uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
sw04060-A_007897-008373 and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
sw04060-A_008373-008639 perhaps somewhat even with the business
sw04060-A_008639-009278 uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are
sw04060-A_009278-009384 one of the
sw04060-A_009384-009797 big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh
sw04060-A_009797-010216 security aspect for long term employment uh
sw04060-A_010928-011096 job security yes
sw04060-A_011998-012064 uh-huh
sw04060-A_012654-013286 yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs
sw04060-A_013286-013843 uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between
sw04060-A_013843-014145 institutions and the corporate world
sw04060-A_014145-014527 in uh institutions are slower to
sw04060-A_014527-015205 react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses
sw04060-A_015205-015448 we need to cut back that's what we do
sw04060-A_015448-015583 but
sw04060-A_015583-015907 yeah and institutionally like here at the university
sw04060-A_015907-016694 oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not [noise] where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which
sw04060-A_017140-017813 well in one s[ense]- sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
sw04060-A_017913-018092 so we end
sw04060-A_018454-018632 it's very easy
sw04060-A_019247-019374 yeah
sw04060-A_019795-020144 right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it
sw04060-A_020564-020643 well
sw04060-A_020643-020752 [noise]
sw04060-A_020752-020912 the uh
sw04060-A_020912-021298 uh th[at's]- that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess
sw04060-A_021298-021677 uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution
sw04060-A_021677-022056 uh the there is not much incentive for
sw04060-A_022056-022663 innovativeness because the the limitation for reward is is very severe
sw04060-A_022663-023166 but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
sw04060-A_023317-023584 uh i guess in innovation although
sw04060-A_023584-023906 he the you know the more complex your structure
sw04060-A_023906-024294 the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
sw04060-A_024294-024549 but uh i think there is uh
sw04060-A_024734-025351 it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh
sw04060-A_025351-025806 things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts
sw04060-A_026798-026900 right
sw04060-A_027334-027574 yeah you end up being your own person
sw04060-A_027574-027969 and uh if you do your job fine and if
sw04060-A_027969-028337 somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
sw04060-A_028444-028593 you know you really
sw04060-A_029069-029468 yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of
sw04060-A_029468-029877 person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves
sw04060-B_000000-000193 [noise] oh
sw04060-B_000193-000762 okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement
sw04060-B_000762-001074 you know not to get in like in a dead end job
sw04060-B_001074-001195 and plus
sw04060-B_001295-001807 for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental
sw04060-B_001936-002135 they're also important
sw04060-B_003464-003593 um
sw04060-B_004675-004775 um
sw04060-B_004879-005366 are they like we[ll]- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh
sw04060-B_005366-005613 j[ust]- just very little variation from there
sw04060-B_006710-006846 um-hum
sw04060-B_007849-007972 um-hum
sw04060-B_010121-010799 well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth
sw04060-B_010799-011045 you mean security job security
sw04060-B_011045-011216 um
sw04060-B_011216-011551 that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know
sw04060-B_011551-012081 if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what November i guess
sw04060-B_012081-012608 but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
sw04060-B_013188-013314 um-hum
sw04060-B_014102-014247 um-hum
sw04060-B_015387-015648 um-hum and there's no doubt yeah
sw04060-B_016588-017115 expedi[ent]- yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most
sw04060-B_017536-017633 [laughter-oh]
sw04060-B_017740-017984 oh see yeah
sw04060-B_017984-018533 yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
sw04060-B_018533-019350 yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
sw04060-B_019350-019837 and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time [laughter-when] [laughter-those] people aren't there anymore
sw04060-B_019961-020089 yeah
sw04060-B_020089-020240 um-hum
sw04060-B_020240-020605 yeah but so what else do you think is important
sw04060-B_022154-022264 um-hum
sw04060-B_022593-022723 um-hum
sw04060-B_024221-024371 um-hum
sw04060-B_025771-026453 i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team
sw04060-B_026453-026872 uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
sw04060-B_026872-027315 probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i thin[k]- you think you're just a number you know
sw04060-B_027511-027632 um-hum
sw04060-B_028324-028452 um-hum
sw04060-B_028452-028972 whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it
sw04060-B_028972-029172 get accomplished you know
sw04060-B_029822-029978 um-hum
sw04062-A_000158-000285 i think
sw04062-A_000508-001007 let's see i di[dn't]- i didn't hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didn't press it hard enough let's try again
sw04062-A_001007-001090 [noise]
sw04062-A_001219-001301 hum
sw04062-A_001714-002990 right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not uh anyway i did press let me press one once again
sw04062-A_002990-003163 [noise]
sw04062-A_003163-004026 well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um
sw04062-A_004026-004888 i uh use a uh a program on my Macintosh which is called Dollars and Cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh
sw04062-A_005121-005645 oh Frisco Texas uh gee i don't even know [laughter]
sw04062-A_005645-005845 Raleigh North Carolina
sw04062-A_006215-006382 [noise]
sw04062-A_006382-006826 i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are
sw04062-A_006826-008233 uh but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a pe[rsonal]- personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't
sw04062-A_008233-009489 the case in in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i- i- i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give you more explanation
sw04062-A_009774-010203 okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting
sw04062-A_011166-011283 um-hum
sw04062-A_012000-013204 i found that it was uh y[ou]- well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but
sw04062-A_013204-013827 if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year [noise]
sw04062-A_013827-013933 um
sw04062-A_014255-014482 for Macintosh yes
sw04062-A_014482-015846 um it's called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is Managing Your Monies by Andrew Tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up [laughter]
sw04062-A_015846-016029 excuse me
sw04062-A_016029-016598 it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um
sw04062-A_016598-017122 you would make one [vocalized-noise] uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to
sw04062-A_017122-018583 change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just
sw04062-A_018583-019354 yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i [laughter-never] never really used any of them so
sw04062-A_019354-020376 uh i- i- i read since then though that they've redes[igned]- rede[signed]- uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um
sw04062-A_020376-020984 [noise] so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or
sw04062-A_022304-022413 [vocalized-noise]
sw04062-A_022639-022706 [vocalized-noise]
sw04062-A_023409-023520 right
sw04062-A_024709-024864 um-hum
sw04062-A_024864-025565 uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions
sw04062-A_025565-026713 uh so so i- i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially
sw04062-A_026713-027083 fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time
sw04062-A_027083-027199 and uh
sw04062-A_027199-027592 uh gee i pray my pay my cable TV annually
sw04062-A_027592-028210 you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember [laughter]
sw04062-A_028210-029168 but they say [laughter] i- uh they always forget you [laughter] every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years
sw04062-A_029168-029644 so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but [laughter] [laughter-now]
sw04062-A_029644-029952 now yeah now i know they are going to do that um
sw04062-B_000052-000185 okay
sw04062-B_000306-000497 ye[s]- yes i'm sure that it
sw04062-B_000958-001070 okay
sw04062-B_001301-001776 well i[t]- it just that that uh recording would begin when the person who called
sw04062-B_001776-001990 presses one but
sw04062-B_002939-003062 okay
sw04062-B_003360-003476 [laughter]
sw04062-B_004776-005143 oh i'm not in San Francisco i'm in Frisco Texas
sw04062-B_005554-005750 where are you
sw04062-B_005750-006852 Raleigh North Carolina i thought you said Rowlett [laughter] we have a little town out [laughter-here] yes okay you know where Dallas is
sw04062-B_009431-009866 oh okay i am fam[iliar]- i am familiar with computers
sw04062-B_010156-011204 no we don't my husband uh takes care of our finances and he just uh just does it all all manually he keeps uh a book sort of
sw04062-B_011204-011957 he uh doesn't keep it on the computer i work with computers and we have one at home but he doesn't use it for that
sw04062-B_013111-013342 right
sw04062-B_013828-014266 and that is a software program that was written for your i mean that you
sw04062-B_014369-014542 just for Macintosh
sw04062-B_015708-015908 too much detail
sw04062-B_015908-016176 was it too much detail to it
sw04062-B_018470-018650 primitive [laughter]
sw04062-B_020930-022100 uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um
sw04062-B_022100-023133 you know the the payments that are due when and uh [noise] what pays off when and uh of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh
sw04062-B_023133-023701 home owner's is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just
sw04062-B_023701-024758 sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money
sw04062-B_027040-027196 um-hum
sw04062-B_028090-028267 well that's nice
sw04062-B_029517-029800 now you expect it [laughter]
sw04063-A_000000-000016 [noise]
sw04063-A_000016-000850 uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check [vocalized-noise] since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by
sw04063-A_000963-001073 uh
sw04063-A_002487-002611 um-hum
sw04063-A_002799-003001 [laughter]
sw04063-A_004297-004414 uh-huh
sw04063-A_005195-005335 [noise]
sw04063-A_006632-006963 oh yeah i can i can understand that [laughter]
sw04063-A_007097-007296 [vocalized-noise] got one kid
sw04063-A_007657-007839 [laughter]
sw04063-A_008157-008293 yeah
sw04063-A_010051-010186 yeah
sw04063-A_010935-011063 yeah
sw04063-A_011408-011582 oh yeah i
sw04063-A_011948-012075 [laughter]
sw04063-A_012075-012965 yeah i understand that ri[ght]- right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now
sw04063-A_012965-013382 through nursing school so it's kind of [laughter]
sw04063-A_013382-013498 got to
sw04063-A_013498-013780 {maxed} out right now but
sw04063-A_013780-014617 we try to put a little away ever[y]- every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and
sw04063-A_014617-015300 we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on
sw04063-A_015401-015558 he's five
sw04063-A_016381-016498 yeah
sw04063-A_016602-016698 yep
sw04063-A_016855-017003 we[ll]- that's
sw04063-A_017745-018612 yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones
sw04063-A_018612-018852 uh U T A
sw04063-A_018852-019002 [vocalized-noise] uh
sw04063-A_019103-019307 and you know
sw04063-A_019307-019966 the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff
sw04063-A_019966-020496 for that because_1 she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that
sw04063-A_020496-020851 that adds more to the gas budget
sw04063-A_021052-021198 do what ma'am
sw04063-A_021458-022528 uh no she goes they have a class there every Tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year
sw04063-A_022528-022975 uh going to the hospital three times a week so
sw04063-A_024295-024401 yeah
sw04063-A_024401-024522 [laughter]
sw04063-A_025202-025310 um-hum
sw04063-A_026488-026630 [laughter]
sw04063-A_027044-027123 [vocalized-noise]
sw04063-A_027223-027410 yeah yeah i understand
sw04063-A_027410-027725 that's the same problem we fall into you know
sw04063-A_027725-028169 you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know
sw04063-A_028169-028542 be with the kids a little bit during that time and
sw04063-A_028542-028755 kind of a family deal
sw04063-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04063-B_000957-001147 well we
sw04063-B_001147-001296 we try
sw04063-B_001296-002512 it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use
sw04063-B_002512-002905 if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
sw04063-B_002905-004099 but um and then at the end of the year i- i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
sw04063-B_004099-005226 you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
sw04063-B_005226-006035 easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting
sw04063-B_006035-006598 i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
sw04063-B_006869-007016 [laughter]
sw04063-B_007016-007203 do you have kids
sw04063-B_007203-007751 one we don't have any because_1 i thought if well if we had a [laughter-child] i don't know what we'd do
sw04063-B_007872-008246 but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
sw04063-B_008246-009134 and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time
sw04063-B_009134-010052 as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K [pan/plan] in a profit sharing
sw04063-B_010052-011000 and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
sw04063-B_011000-011466 because to me that's the only way we're ever going s[ave]- to be able to save
sw04063-B_011466-012006 because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
sw04063-B_012884-013017 oh yeah
sw04063-B_013402-013551 that's very hard
sw04063-B_013652-013791 um-hum
sw04063-B_015212-015470 yeah they say how old is he
sw04063-B_015470-015850 he's five they say by the time
sw04063-B_015850-016661 kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college
sw04063-B_016661-016866 and it's just unbelievable
sw04063-B_016866-017750 you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything
sw04063-B_018509-018700 um-hum where is she going
sw04063-B_018801-018902 yeah
sw04063-B_018902-019059 i'm sure it is
sw04063-B_020608-021093 oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals
sw04063-B_021093-021465 has she started doing any of work at the hospitals
sw04063-B_022920-024000 yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and
sw04063-B_024000-024448 and all the things which was an added expense [noise]
sw04063-B_024448-024986 but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father
sw04063-B_024986-025214 living in a budget was no problem
sw04063-B_025214-026016 it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's
sw04063-B_026016-026865 you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and bef[ore]- you know
sw04063-B_026865-027431 parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way
sw04063-B_027608-027770 um-hum
sw04063-B_028131-028300 um-hum
sw04063-B_028497-028693 and it's hard
sw04063-B_028796-029343 and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are [vocalized-noise]
sw04063-B_029343-029598 credit card rates are still
sw04063-B_029598-029939 sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent
sw04064-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04064-A_000011-000231 well how do you feel about trial by jury
sw04064-A_000672-000824 in what way
sw04064-A_001861-002046 [laughter]
sw04064-A_002046-002747 [laughter] i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to[ward]- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
sw04064-A_002875-003470 um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
sw04064-A_004549-004750 um-hum
sw04064-A_004750-005396 the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be
sw04064-A_005396-005951 uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that
sw04064-A_005951-006979 you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de[cision]- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
sw04064-A_007349-007494 um-hum
sw04064-A_007494-007791 i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem
sw04064-A_008023-008150 um-hum
sw04064-A_009374-009499 um-hum
sw04064-A_010928-011052 um-hum
sw04064-A_011864-012107 [laughter]
sw04064-A_012328-012456 um-hum
sw04064-A_013439-013621 um-hum [noise]
sw04064-A_013621-013810 yeah i
sw04064-A_013810-014749 i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sen[tencing]- the well what i don't like about uh sen[tencing]- juries doing the sentencing in that
sw04064-A_014749-015486 i think it becomes a lot less th[e]- th[e]- the the same crime gets unequal sentences
sw04064-A_015486-016422 i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know s[electing]- s[electing]- selecting a jury two two different juries that would
sw04064-A_016422-017010 most of the time come up with the same idea [vocalized-noise] the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
sw04064-A_017010-017109 but
sw04064-A_017109-017451 i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
sw04064-A_017451-017625 in trying to
sw04064-A_017625-018204 gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that
sw04064-A_018204-018512 that measure stick across the board
sw04064-A_018985-019109 um-hum
sw04064-A_019374-019512 um-hum
sw04064-A_020194-020354 um-hum
sw04064-A_020354-020968 of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]
sw04064-A_020968-021115 um-hum
sw04064-A_021437-021501 [noise]
sw04064-A_022073-022200 um-hum
sw04064-A_022502-022817 yeah i agree [laughter]
sw04064-A_023553-023677 um-hum
sw04064-A_023914-024008 um-hum
sw04064-A_024334-025755 oh yeah i- i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cann[ot]- they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their c[lient]- client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury
sw04064-A_025755-026018 through argument that the
sw04064-A_026018-026182 um-hum
sw04064-A_026909-027041 um-hum
sw04064-A_027219-027347 um-hum
sw04064-A_028446-028613 yeah
sw04064-A_028613-028830 uh
sw04064-A_028830-029856 yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
sw04064-B_000000-000168 [noise]
sw04064-B_000168-000742 i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
sw04064-B_000742-001508 in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented
sw04064-B_001508-001906 i have uh very little regard for the law
sw04064-B_001906-002265 [laughter] that's presently practiced [laughter]
sw04064-B_002607-002947 i was thinking primarily criminal cases
sw04064-B_003250-003389 yes
sw04064-B_003389-003852 um-hum that's a concern of mine uh
sw04064-B_003852-004634 i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
sw04064-B_005698-005848 um-hum
sw04064-B_007036-007451 yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers
sw04064-B_007451-007609 uh
sw04064-B_007736-008465 uh too often i think they're not and uh when you y[ou]- when you are
sw04064-B_008465-009428 selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
sw04064-B_009428-010415 you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh
sw04064-B_010415-011044 they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
sw04064-B_011044-012028 uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has [vocalized-noise] doing sentencing without the jury [laughter]
sw04064-B_012028-012123 [laughter]
sw04064-B_012123-012929 [noise] i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either
sw04064-B_012929-013499 you know the the plaintiff or the defendant uh the th[e]- the full benefit of the law
sw04064-B_013499-013793 and i guess that's what i am concerned with
sw04064-B_014560-014715 um-hum
sw04064-B_015406-015608 this is very true
sw04064-B_016823-017080 um-hum um-hum
sw04064-B_018460-019442 yeah and you do see such un[even]- uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean
sw04064-B_019442-020281 where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for some[thing]-
sw04064-B_020281-020457 uh
sw04064-B_020892-021132 isn't that the truth [laughter]
sw04064-B_021132-021466 [noise] there are times when is it uh
sw04064-B_021466-021919 oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello
sw04064-B_021919-022579 you know where he says kill all the [laughter-lawyers] [laughter] every now and then one is tempted to feel that way
sw04064-B_022579-023764 [laughter] but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of
sw04064-B_023764-024433 you know am[ateur]- as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
sw04064-B_025145-025290 um-hum
sw04064-B_025837-027271 and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved [vocalized-noise] sl[ightly]- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off
sw04064-B_027271-028306 uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
sw04064-B_028306-028713 so i don't know [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw04064-B_029008-029131 [vocalized-noise]
sw04065-A_000000-000637 [noise] okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees
sw04065-A_002357-002505 uh-huh
sw04065-A_003222-003549 oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean
sw04065-A_003782-003941 uh-huh
sw04065-A_004225-004370 uh-huh
sw04065-A_005139-005304 um-hum
sw04065-A_006284-006449 um-hum
sw04065-A_007528-007677 uh-huh
sw04065-A_007677-007990 would you [vocalized-noise] uh would you
sw04065-A_007990-008602 do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay
sw04065-A_009516-009661 yeah
sw04065-A_010524-010678 um-hum
sw04065-A_010974-011107 yeah
sw04065-A_011500-012110 it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs
sw04065-A_012110-013116 but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that
sw04065-A_013486-013662 yeah
sw04065-A_014878-015022 yeah
sw04065-A_015146-015492 [laughter] and we're and we're getting
sw04065-A_015492-015726 it does feel like it doesn't it
sw04065-A_015726-015873 i know
sw04065-A_015987-016488 well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring
sw04065-A_016488-016856 doctors have been on drugs for years [laughter] from what i hear
sw04065-A_016856-018143 you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it
sw04065-A_018143-018737 the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it
sw04065-A_018847-019176 right and yet the potential like
sw04065-A_019176-019909 i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body
sw04065-A_021122-021276 uh-huh
sw04065-A_021626-021807 [laughter]
sw04065-A_022437-022680 that's right that's right
sw04065-A_023215-023925 [laughter] it's o[nly]- o[nly]- only old lady so and so from where ever and [vocalized-noise]
sw04065-A_023925-024150 [laughter-right]
sw04065-A_024150-024307 [laughter]
sw04065-A_024992-026048 yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not su[re]- i was trying to think in in history ha[ve]- have people checked that or did people just
sw04065-A_026048-026319 did people just
sw04065-A_026319-027503 accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before
sw04065-A_028592-028755 um-hum
sw04065-A_028755-028879 um-hum
sw04065-A_029476-029620 right
sw04065-B_000000-000444 [noise]
sw04065-B_000444-001507 well i- i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be
sw04065-B_001507-002457 you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's impor[tant]- whose decisions are important and [vocalized-noise] you know that's
sw04065-B_002457-003068 that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work
sw04065-B_003068-003419 as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if
sw04065-B_003419-004292 yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision
sw04065-B_004292-004732 when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're
sw04065-B_004732-005235 if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever
sw04065-B_005235-005712 then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining
sw04065-B_005712-006371 what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights
sw04065-B_006371-006631 that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's
sw04065-B_006631-007405 if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking w[ould]- would they just you know i mean y[ou]- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people
sw04065-B_007405-007756 the right to do what they need to do what they want to do
sw04065-B_008251-009039 yes i okay i'm i'm i'm i- i think that's fine i think if you're if if it matters to you that much then
sw04065-B_009039-010261 you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just
sw04065-B_010261-011019 come back and and get you anytime you know i- i don't think it it could be surprise at your door here we are [laughter-you] [laughter-know] or
sw04065-B_011019-011557 or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i- i don't know it's kind of [vocalized-noise]
sw04065-B_011557-011645 [noise]
sw04065-B_011645-011874 yeah it's it's really you don't
sw04065-B_011874-012006 [noise]
sw04065-B_012006-012165 yeah exactly
sw04065-B_012526-012924 [noise]
sw04065-B_012924-013022 yeah
sw04065-B_013022-013301 um-hum it's yeah it's kind of a
sw04065-B_013301-013586 [noise] do you trust me do you not trust me
sw04065-B_013586-014393 you know it's i don't know i d[on't]- i don't know it's it's awfully it's it has it's points it's good points and it's bad points see
sw04065-B_014393-014938 it kind of makes us look like we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world's going almost
sw04065-B_014938-015202 you know i've walls are coming come in Berlin and
sw04065-B_015202-015342 we [laughter]
sw04065-B_015342-015629 and here we are we're going the other way and
sw04065-B_015629-016082 yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem
sw04065-B_016082-016733 [noise]
sw04065-B_016733-016949 [noise] oh yeah yeah
sw04065-B_017126-018603 [noise]
sw04065-B_018603-019031 yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah
sw04065-B_019343-019416 [laughter]
sw04065-B_019666-019787 yeah
sw04065-B_019787-020535 yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so
sw04065-B_020535-021191 uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility
sw04065-B_021191-021700 you but i guess that's [laughter] more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself
sw04065-B_021700-023020 it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to [vocalized-noise] if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well
sw04065-B_023020-023579 it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or [laughter-something] [laughter] you kn[ow]- [noise]
sw04065-B_023579-023745 [noise]
sw04065-B_023745-025116 [laughter-yeah] yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't [laughter] you know no problem yeah i guess that's j[ust]- uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so
sw04065-B_027292-028556 that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i- i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have [laughter-gone] downhill quite a bit since
sw04065-B_028556-029179 earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts
sw04065-B_029179-029907 you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so
sw04066-A_000000-000092 [noise] well
sw04066-A_001364-001628 yeah uh-huh
sw04066-A_002136-002734 well i know we're kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so
sw04066-A_002734-003901 the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh legal injections lethal injection
sw04066-A_003901-004026 and uh
sw04066-A_004026-004542 it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death
sw04066-A_004542-005570 and i think at this point i am for that as long you know as they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and
sw04066-A_005570-006554 this i don't see why they should have to and why why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row
sw04066-A_006554-007307 that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal
sw04066-A_007307-007465 bit then
sw04066-A_007465-007704 why continue [noise]
sw04066-A_008791-008893 that's right
sw04066-A_010842-011182 right i can agree with that That it's
sw04066-A_012091-012211 right
sw04066-A_013232-013348 yes
sw04066-A_014044-015455 yes Well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it They i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row
sw04066-A_015455-015595 and
sw04066-A_015595-016187 uh i think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this that it just [noise]
sw04066-A_016187-016659 [laughter] oh wow We do everything else fast [laughter]
sw04066-A_016986-017127 right [laughter]
sw04066-A_017127-017260 uh-huh
sw04066-A_017695-017861 uh-huh
sw04066-A_017861-018063 uh
sw04066-A_018063-018326 i think that was in Houston
sw04066-A_018326-018493 yes uh-huh
sw04066-A_018603-018849 i believe so and uh
sw04066-A_018849-019438 i know we're going through a case right now that uh where parent's starved a child to death
sw04066-A_019438-019617 and uh
sw04066-A_019617-020216 i've heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not
sw04066-A_020216-021226 uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this [laughter-child]
sw04066-A_021226-022048 the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind
sw04066-A_022048-022323 that these people ought to get the death penalty
sw04066-A_022459-022599 that uh [noise]
sw04066-A_022599-022838 they did it they did it knowingly
sw04066-A_023455-023626 yes uh-huh
sw04066-A_023626-024450 oh they the were just punishing They didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught They had two of them
sw04066-A_024803-024935 uh-huh
sw04066-A_024935-025214 two children One did not die
sw04066-A_026049-026309 well could be [vocalized-noise]
sw04066-A_026731-027076 well i don't think i [laughter-would] but uh
sw04066-A_028045-028156 uh-huh
sw04066-A_028156-028418 Well you may have a point there i
sw04066-A_028418-029054 it's just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but i've read so much about it and
sw04066-A_029342-029589 [laughter] it just upsets me [laughter]
sw04066-A_029589-029952 but but other than that uh you know i just
sw04066-B_000006-000438 i just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said [noise]
sw04066-B_000438-001546 you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what uh how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that
sw04066-B_001546-002192 i honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas
sw04066-B_003805-003932 uh-huh
sw04066-B_007639-008871 yeah i- i st[rongly]- i i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal
sw04066-B_008871-009299 and uh and i can see the the necessity of it
sw04066-B_009299-009478 but uh
sw04066-B_009478-010870 i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no que[stion]- if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then n[ot]- in everyone's mind it's not actually settled
sw04066-B_011024-012148 so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt
sw04066-B_012148-013293 and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent or where they've killed several people
sw04066-B_013293-014106 yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it
sw04066-B_015394-015529 is that right
sw04066-B_015529-015627 oh wow
sw04066-B_016197-016303 [laughter]
sw04066-B_016303-016405 baby
sw04066-B_016520-017062 that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so
sw04066-B_017062-017539 it's in the news it's not it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case
sw04066-B_017539-017766 that that was in the news everywhere
sw04066-B_017766-017929 now where was that at
sw04066-B_018235-018435 so that was in Texas too
sw04066-B_018435-018608 that's what i thought
sw04066-B_020958-021065 uh-huh
sw04066-B_022834-023266 i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and
sw04066-B_023266-023740 and were they were they punishing the kid and they didn't realize that he was going to die or oh they did
sw04066-B_024453-024881 well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them
sw04066-B_024881-025086 two chi[ldren]- two children
sw04066-B_025190-025295 one didn't
sw04066-B_025295-025366 huh
sw04066-B_025366-025964 yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids
sw04066-B_026123-026740 that would that would s[eem]- that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that
sw04066-B_027070-027179 well
sw04066-B_027179-028158 no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide
sw04066-B_029272-029424 yeah that's
sw04066-B_029424-029548 that is
sw04066-B_029548-029734 that is a tough one
sw04067-A_000000-000074 [noise]
sw04067-A_000074-000368 okay so what do you think about uh
sw04067-A_000368-000724 uh health care for the elderly
sw04067-A_002553-002686 [laughter]
sw04067-A_004479-004614 right
sw04067-A_005716-005844 [vocalized-noise]
sw04067-A_008177-008312 all the bills
sw04067-A_008412-008621 does that include um
sw04067-A_008621-008892 nursing home type care
sw04067-A_008892-009133 just strictly health care
sw04067-A_009311-009431 right
sw04067-A_010438-010598 right
sw04067-A_010598-011016 that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good
sw04067-A_011016-011153 hm
sw04067-A_014398-014531 um
sw04067-A_015060-015173 hm
sw04067-A_015516-015645 right
sw04067-A_015645-016031 so where d[oes]- does she well um
sw04067-A_016031-016611 i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is [vocalized-noise]
sw04067-A_017372-017568 right i guess
sw04067-A_017568-018479 that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it she's not really
sw04067-A_018479-019521 uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them
sw04067-A_019521-020209 but she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own any longer
sw04067-A_020209-020896 and that's that's kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children
sw04067-A_022111-022236 right
sw04067-A_022816-022936 yeah
sw04067-A_022936-024219 yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh Alzheimer's i guess
sw04067-A_024219-025269 and so her memory is very poor [laughter] and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her [laughter]
sw04067-A_028454-028586 um-hum
sw04067-A_029689-029875 that's true
sw04067-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04067-B_000671-001165 well i've got a mom who is uh eighty six years old this year
sw04067-B_001165-001511 and uh
sw04067-B_001511-001700 sh[e]- she
sw04067-B_001700-002295 uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years s[ix]- actually six years and then she moved
sw04067-B_002295-002836 uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house
sw04067-B_002836-003240 uh i think health care for the elderly is uh
sw04067-B_003240-003526 is uh its kind of a difficult
sw04067-B_003718-004534 i say difficult i mean there's as your body is running downhill they can spend an infinite amount to keep you alive
sw04067-B_004534-005059 and on the other hand it's kind of nice uh
sw04067-B_005059-005624 if you're taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh
sw04067-B_005624-006708 the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an HMO they took all the money from from uh Medicare
sw04067-B_006708-007732 how should i say it uh this HMO thing said uh had an agreement with Medicare that said uh on the average you're gonna spend X amount of dollars per year
sw04067-B_007732-008448 so if you'll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills
sw04067-B_008783-009079 no this is just you know standard
sw04067-B_009079-009379 health care like you'd get from your employer
sw04067-B_009379-009523 and uh
sw04067-B_009523-010072 so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh
sw04067-B_010072-010596 there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and
sw04067-B_010906-011414 well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldn't cover but they like they bought her a uh
sw04067-B_011414-011563 a uh
sw04067-B_011734-012423 [noise] let's see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh
sw04067-B_012423-013516 uh before that time she was always subject she she'd have these salesmen that would call and say hey if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for
sw04067-B_013516-014467 three times the the real price uh Medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didn't need
sw04067-B_014467-015110 and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no Medicare wouldn't pay for it
sw04067-B_015110-015546 so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way
sw04067-B_015651-015805 so how about_1 you
sw04067-B_016495-017039 no she's still she's staying with my uh actually she's staying with my
sw04067-B_017039-017691 brother's son who's doesn't have [laughter-teenagers] [noise]
sw04067-B_019496-019631 yeah
sw04067-B_019818-019882 [noise]
sw04067-B_020862-021198 yeah it was difficult for us to because uh
sw04067-B_021198-021301 [noise]
sw04067-B_021301-021608 well actually it it was all right as long as she could
sw04067-B_021608-022043 could get back and forth to the uh you know to the bathroom and
sw04067-B_022043-022903 things like that but when she go[t]- when she got really sick and she couldn't move very much then it was exhausting absolutely exhausting
sw04067-B_022903-023050 you know so [noise]
sw04067-B_024125-024272 oh yeah
sw04067-B_025263-025935 [noise] yeah uh and that [noise] to that extent i th[ink]- like i say this health care for the elderly is
sw04067-B_025935-026972 is uh i- i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this
sw04067-B_026972-028022 oh i don't wanna know fog so to speak uh we had uh a a baby fairly late in life and uh as soon as that baby came along uh
sw04067-B_028022-028835 uh she paid a lot of attention to you know something to take care of i'll put it that way and something to pay attention to and and uh
sw04067-B_028835-029376 the other thing i've noticed is that that uh pets and and uh
sw04067-B_029376-029875 if they have pets to take care of uh like she got yeah she got uh
sw04068-A_000000-000084 so uh
sw04068-A_000084-000499 d[o]- do you know what the laws of Texas are in regard to capital punishment
sw04068-A_001615-001753 i'm sorry would you repeat that please
sw04068-A_001872-002381 i'm sorry you you're just a little [vocalized-noise] just a little quiet i just couldn't quite hear what you said
sw04068-A_002602-002736 uh-huh
sw04068-A_002933-003064 uh-huh
sw04068-A_003064-003363 yeah and he i i'm uh
sw04068-A_003363-004009 i believe in California it is permitted but for a few years they were
sw04068-A_004009-004805 not doing it i don't think i don't think there's been an execution for a while uh but i'm a little ignorant of it myself i know that there was a
sw04068-A_004805-005863 [noise] there was a state supreme court justice who was uh being pounded on in the newspapers because she was overturning
sw04068-A_005863-006864 uh convictions or she was somehow keeping death penalties from being carried out and uh the newspapers were
sw04068-A_006864-007443 giving her a very hard time on that although i always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on her about
sw04068-A_007775-007949 well i
sw04068-A_007949-008230 i don't to me it seems unnecessary
sw04068-A_008230-008373 um
sw04068-A_008373-008650 i think that the sort of person who
sw04068-A_008650-008939 would be deterred
sw04068-A_008939-009370 by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison
sw04068-A_009370-009548 um
sw04068-A_009548-009712 and uh
sw04068-A_009712-009766 [noise]
sw04068-A_009766-009990 it seems just with the possibility of
sw04068-A_009990-010235 making mistakes that uh
sw04068-A_010235-011042 i would rather opt for life in prison where at least there's a chance the person could uh either change or perhaps even
sw04068-A_011042-011434 you know contribute to society from prison in some way
sw04068-A_011434-011664 well what do you feeling [vocalized-noise]
sw04068-A_012453-012589 um-hum
sw04068-A_013672-013758 [noise]
sw04068-A_013758-013950 [noise] right it's uh
sw04068-A_014699-014943 do you think it would be a deterrent
sw04068-A_015143-015516 well that is true that is true um
sw04068-A_016340-016470 uh-huh
sw04068-A_016928-017374 oh i see you're thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be
sw04068-A_017374-017758 [noise] maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of
sw04068-A_017758-017925 of killing somebody
sw04068-A_017925-018041 um
sw04068-A_018234-018845 well you know i mean i think i think i'm in agreement with you on this point that hey there's a problem and
sw04068-A_018845-019729 the solution to the problem isn't whether you kill people or not at the end it's what happens before that uh and i would say that uh
sw04068-A_019729-019926 you know putting more
sw04068-A_019926-020305 giving more attention to uh child rearing
sw04068-A_020305-020900 you know as early as that i[s]- is it the terms of giving kids a good education and uh
sw04068-A_021043-021275 sort of a good uh
sw04068-A_021275-022130 i don't know moral or self esteem sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in the first place
sw04068-A_022130-022427 could make it less necessary also
sw04068-A_022643-023093 yeah and that's i it seems like people uh
sw04068-A_023093-024058 focus more on the one end of the system where you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not
sw04068-A_024058-024205 uh
sw04068-A_024205-024459 so i think that sort of goes along with what you're saying
sw04068-A_024459-024611 uh
sw04068-A_024611-025713 are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable
sw04068-A_025825-025959 um-hum
sw04068-A_026573-026701 um-hum
sw04068-A_026807-026940 um-hum
sw04068-A_027137-027266 um-hum
sw04068-A_027852-027981 um-hum
sw04068-A_028606-028743 um-hum
sw04068-A_028935-029073 um-hum
sw04068-B_000568-001791 um i have to plead ignorant i really don't know i- i think that that uh i think Texas is for it i don't think we've had any instances of it
sw04068-B_001791-001922 pardon
sw04068-B_002151-002292 oh okay
sw04068-B_002292-003156 sorry i said Texas is is for capital punishment um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but but it is
sw04068-B_004323-004486 um-hum
sw04068-B_005479-005619 um-hum
sw04068-B_006546-006678 um-hum
sw04068-B_007369-008011 yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment
sw04068-B_010507-011375 [noise]
sw04068-B_011375-011499 um-hum
sw04068-B_011614-012767 well uh i probably tend to fa[ll]- come down on the side of of being for it but i- i think it
sw04068-B_012767-013727 i[t]- it shouldn't be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that you're you know no mistakes have been made
sw04068-B_013727-014676 but then i- i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it
sw04068-B_014928-015193 well obviously that person wouldn't do it again
sw04068-B_015193-015351 [laughter]
sw04068-B_015351-016405 and it but but i think that like i said i[f]- if the laws that are already on on the books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law
sw04068-B_016405-016987 then i think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime
sw04068-B_017676-017813 um-hum
sw04068-B_017813-018332 right because i- i think too many too many of them_1 walk you know
sw04068-B_019389-019531 um-hum
sw04068-B_022150-022260 [vocalized-noise]
sw04068-B_022381-022718 well that's true you've got to have the foundation there
sw04068-B_025650-026035 um well i think murder is number one
sw04068-B_026035-026156 uh
sw04068-B_026156-026361 i- i- i- i
sw04068-B_026361-027333 tend to believe in an eye for an eye if you if you take a life then you need to lose yours you know not not that you can bring the other person back and and obviously can't
sw04068-B_027333-027574 but i see no reason
sw04068-B_027574-027699 to
sw04068-B_027699-028252 for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know there's too much of
sw04068-B_028252-029190 if you could put them_1 away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing but
sw04068-B_029190-029538 most of of the uh
sw04068-B_029658-029891 murderers that go to jail get
sw04069-A_000000-000650 [noise] i'm an avid recycler um but our city's not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there
sw04069-A_001284-001427 uh-huh
sw04069-A_001885-002024 uh-huh
sw04069-A_002445-002706 you don't know [laughter-yeah]
sw04069-A_003314-003553 right that they pick up
sw04069-A_003553-003675 um-hum
sw04069-A_003675-003889 um-hum
sw04069-A_003889-004100 uh-huh
sw04069-A_004100-004295 right
sw04069-A_004295-004522 nobody wanted to do it
sw04069-A_004771-005013 it do you have a place to take them_1
sw04069-A_005416-005665 wow is that right
sw04069-A_006246-006689 worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah
sw04069-A_006810-006948 right
sw04069-A_007049-007301 yeah oh i know i know it
sw04069-A_007829-008023 [laughter]
sw04069-A_008023-008479 now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper
sw04069-A_008581-008756 oh really
sw04069-A_009043-009292 d[o]- with their claws or chew it
sw04069-A_009292-009524 how fascinating
sw04069-A_009524-010100 oh isn't that interesting i've got three cats but newspapers don't seem to interest them at all
sw04069-A_010255-010454 oh no [laughter]
sw04069-A_010554-010835 is that right oh my gosh
sw04069-A_011231-011464 and then they learned how huh
sw04069-A_011587-012565 well that's funny well i- i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some
sw04069-A_012565-013623 uh curbside recycling they've got sp[ecial]- special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about_1
sw04069-A_013623-014478 you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and
sw04069-A_014478-015072 everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there
sw04069-A_015275-016121 uh then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of of a of a solution to a problem
sw04069-A_016121-016772 and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything [laughter-so]
sw04069-A_016894-017476 back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uh-huh yeah well that's good
sw04069-A_017928-018907 and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i
sw04069-A_018907-020058 oh i even carry around uh you know like if i- i- i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating [laughter] in the car or on the way to the next site
sw04069-A_020058-020969 and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them_1 again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to [laughter-live]
sw04069-A_020969-021499 [vocalized-noise] we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and
sw04069-A_021731-021876 uh-huh
sw04069-A_022038-022654 ye[ah]- right ex[actly]- [laughter-exactly] lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place
sw04069-A_022654-022817 [laughter-yeah]
sw04069-A_023053-023879 that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in [laughter] because_1 it just leaves me with having to dispose of it
sw04069-A_023879-024351 no [laughter-please] [laughter-no]
sw04069-A_024650-024775 yeah
sw04069-A_024775-025511 and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and
sw04069-A_025511-026891 cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it
sw04069-A_027310-027490 right
sw04069-A_027490-027937 but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah
sw04069-A_028111-029298 yeah yeah i know and i[t]- and it it really is hard and and uh i then i'll fill up the back of my [laughter-car] and i'm driving around with trash [laughter-in] [laughter-my] [laughter-car] and tha[t]- well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing
sw04069-A_029298-029907 you know because [laughter] they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash [laughter] [laughter-anyway]
sw04069-B_000000-000073 [noise]
sw04069-B_000601-001816 there is a group in town called Nacogdoches Recycles that will meet i believe it's once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers
sw04069-B_001816-001966 or bottles
sw04069-B_001966-002549 but it's up to you to collect them_1 it's up to you to get them_1 down there and then what they do with them i don't know
sw04069-B_002549-003452 there isn't any y[ou]- somebody had had talked once before to City Council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans
sw04069-B_003452-004426 uh-huh because_1 they do that in Palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that
sw04069-B_004426-004728 and i save aluminum cans and
sw04069-B_004728-005198 to take those to the to the closest place is about
sw04069-B_005198-005515 it's about thirty minutes away
sw04069-B_005515-005995 yeah and it and the last time we took some things
sw04069-B_005995-006228 the price is not really
sw04069-B_006228-006477 worth it [laughter]
sw04069-B_006477-006854 yeah yeah because_1 by the time and you save them_1 and squish them_1 and
sw04069-B_006854-007142 [vocalized-noise] they're just they were everywhere
sw04069-B_007142-007933 and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day
sw04069-B_007933-008131 destroyed those
sw04069-B_008384-009095 mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up
sw04069-B_009095-009305 um-hum both
sw04069-B_009409-009561 i don't know what it is
sw04069-B_009999-010729 i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on on the coffee table or it's chewed up
sw04069-B_010729-011360 and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on
sw04069-B_011360-011695 uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time
sw04069-B_014881-015465 yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would
sw04069-B_016042-016224 that's true
sw04069-B_016546-017131 oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store
sw04069-B_017131-017296 uh-huh
sw04069-B_017296-017986 but but as far as bottles and things go there isn't any place any any close
sw04069-B_018294-018530 yeah yeah
sw04069-B_019977-020147 um-hum
sw04069-B_020890-021040 it really is
sw04069-B_021339-021845 yeah i i've started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things [vocalized-noise]
sw04069-B_021845-022218 and i save all the little condiments and [laughter-things] and i
sw04069-B_022441-023182 yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator
sw04069-B_023739-024089 exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not
sw04069-B_024193-024765 but i- i- try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but
sw04069-B_024765-024907 that's
sw04069-B_026725-027749 yeah and i've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room
sw04069-B_027749-028222 yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is
sw04069-B_028909-029040 yeah
sw04069-B_029486-029907 [laughter] and that's true
sw04070-A_000000-000301 [noise] well i definitely think taxes are too high
sw04070-A_000301-001119 uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now
sw04070-A_001119-002125 and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes
sw04070-A_002125-002983 but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridi[culous]- you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes
sw04070-A_002983-003572 uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing
sw04070-A_005176-005514 you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
sw04070-A_005953-006017 uh-huh
sw04070-A_007211-007348 oh really
sw04070-A_007552-007749  get out of my room 
sw04070-A_009165-009307 interesting
sw04070-A_010745-010882 sure
sw04070-A_013178-014168 my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here
sw04070-A_014168-014610 uh some of the public schools get more funds than
sw04070-A_014610-015706 the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student
sw04070-A_015706-015941 but the best private school
sw04070-A_015941-017236 is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money
sw04070-A_017236-017767 just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and
sw04070-A_018083-018184 [laughter]
sw04070-A_018613-019411 yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um
sw04070-A_019411-019837 uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which
sw04070-A_019837-020932 all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction
sw04070-A_020932-021619 meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up
sw04070-A_021619-022333 uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools
sw04070-A_022333-023176 went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh
sw04070-A_023929-024436 yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh
sw04070-A_024436-025345 on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending
sw04070-A_025345-026145 a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money
sw04070-A_026145-027027 and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here
sw04070-A_027027-027630 last Saturday and ju[st]- we just had our primary in Georgia and uh
sw04070-A_027630-028525 uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh
sw04070-A_028525-029028 and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year
sw04070-A_029028-029879 what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he ta[lked]- and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabi[net]-
sw04070-B_003587-004326 well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
sw04070-B_004326-004876 yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh
sw04070-B_004876-005170 here in my state uh
sw04070-B_005426-006003 yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax
sw04070-B_006003-007225 and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically no[body]- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here
sw04070-B_007225-008385 yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student
sw04070-B_008385-009225 is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low
sw04070-B_009225-010227 uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh
sw04070-B_010227-010829 uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees
sw04070-B_010829-011333 but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh
sw04070-B_011333-012250 towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's
sw04070-B_012250-012795 you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh
sw04070-B_012795-013305 uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well
sw04070-B_017538-018614 well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff
sw04070-B_022931-024007 yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that
sw04071-A_000000-000008 [noise]
sw04071-A_000008-001156 well Jackie uh on taxes i i'd guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is that i'd do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that
sw04071-A_001397-001503 right
sw04071-A_001503-001628 uh
sw04071-A_001628-002099 where you live do y[ou]- you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
sw04071-A_002200-002355 uh uh-huh
sw04071-A_002355-003222 yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax
sw04071-A_003222-003764 uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent
sw04071-A_003764-004314 and we have uh what we call the five B's uh [vocalized-noise] for our taxes
sw04071-A_004314-005347 booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling
sw04071-A_005347-006450 so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes [vocalized-noise]
sw04071-A_007850-007961 uh-huh
sw04071-A_008205-008344 well that's nice
sw04071-A_008445-008658 nice t[o]- nice to get a refund
sw04071-A_008947-009683 uh-huh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we're getting value for it
sw04071-A_009796-009919 yeah
sw04071-A_009919-011137 uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra[nsfusion]- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
sw04071-A_011137-011279 you know what i mean
sw04071-A_011279-012047 uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because
sw04071-A_012047-013133 right because uh y[eah]- there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
sw04071-A_013133-013892 and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you
sw04071-A_014017-014172 [noise]
sw04071-A_014987-015121 um-hum
sw04071-A_016518-016697 that's it
sw04071-A_016799-016885 um-hum
sw04071-A_017243-017996 well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
sw04071-A_017996-018685 uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know
sw04071-A_018685-019498 um [noise] i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax
sw04071-A_019498-020355 uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amou[nt]- i mean you you take your total salary
sw04071-A_020355-021168 uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h[ave]- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had
sw04071-A_021168-022110 and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after y[ou]- you know after you uh figure out [noise] you know who's in your family
sw04071-A_022110-022930 and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know
sw04071-A_022930-023088 yeah
sw04071-A_023088-024055 i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a l[ot]- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but
sw04071-A_024055-024508 i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans
sw04071-A_024508-025839 [noise] i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
sw04071-A_025974-026149 doesn't seem fair to me
sw04071-A_026503-026640 right
sw04071-A_026827-027306 right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i- i- if i'm not mistaken aren't they
sw04071-A_027306-027688 i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is
sw04071-A_027688-027827 twenty percent
sw04071-A_028006-028126 just
sw04071-A_028126-028377 you just pay it huh [laughter]
sw04071-A_028377-028555 [vocalized-noise]
sw04071-A_028555-029917 you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
sw04071-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04071-B_001106-001444 i agree i think taxes are high
sw04071-B_002059-002303 um yes uh-huh
sw04071-B_003197-003342 oh

sw04071-B_006377-006563 right
sw04071-B_006563-007210 yeah i ag[ree]- i agree [vocalized-noise] i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting
sw04071-B_007210-008227 um well if you do get money back from [noise] like jobs like i'm still a student so um i only work part time so i- i get a check back
sw04071-B_008227-008558 from from taxes but
sw04071-B_008558-009079 yeah [laughter-it] [laughter-is] but [laughter] it's not much [laughter]
sw04071-B_009079-009199 so
sw04071-B_009663-009807 no
sw04071-B_011074-011202 yeah

sw04071-B_013844-013966 right
sw04071-B_013966-015332 yeah i don't know i don't doesn't seem like they're doing much with it neither i mean there's plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i me[an]- they have nice plans and
sw04071-B_015332-016512 um but [laughter] they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with [laughter-all] the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised
sw04071-B_016512-017064 i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don['t]- really understand it but
sw04071-B_017064-017225 it's just
sw04071-B_017225-017437 you know [laughter]
sw04071-B_018625-018772 right
sw04071-B_020263-020388 um-hum
sw04071-B_021152-021265 hm

sw04071-B_029858-029917 y[eah]-
sw04072-A_000000-000023 [noise]

sw04072-A_001416-001757 that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV
sw04072-A_001757-002197 i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
sw04072-A_002197-002591 so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
sw04072-A_002591-002842 too great [laughter-sometimes]
sw04072-A_004053-004405 yeah the radio doesn't really have much
sw04072-A_004405-004869 news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music
sw04072-A_005202-005976 yeah do you think that TV is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
sw04072-A_007579-007709 yeah
sw04072-A_008384-008507 [laughter]
sw04072-A_008507-009172 yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news

sw04072-A_011641-011728 yeah
sw04072-A_011832-012212 going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for
sw04072-A_012212-012433 you know actual news
sw04072-A_012433-012596 i think you know the
sw04072-A_012596-013058 probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
sw04072-A_013058-013193 they
sw04072-A_013295-013668 typically have a better i am from a small town too here in Texas

sw04072-A_014189-014466 yeah farm report and oil reports
sw04072-A_014466-014849 [laughter-that's] pretty pretty sad or who killed who

sw04072-A_016199-016965 well in um in Dallas um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's
sw04072-A_016965-017222 and the story was uh
sw04072-A_017474-017702 yeah and the news covered it
sw04072-A_017702-018257 right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who

sw04072-A_018560-019032 local news station was using as a as their promo
sw04072-A_019032-019387 to promote themselves i just thought that was really
sw04072-A_019387-019558 that's kind of cold
sw04072-A_020181-020925 yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
sw04072-A_020925-021160 it real personal moment
sw04072-A_021265-022003 yeah it didn't seem like there was like much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions
sw04072-A_022115-022326 it's just gotten so i mean
sw04072-A_022326-023070 somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite days you know
sw04072-A_023070-023267 [noise] and everything
sw04072-A_023696-023825 yeah

sw04072-A_027436-027752 the damage that really happened that's
sw04072-A_027752-028587 a lot of times [vocalized-noise] like the news coverage showed all the you know guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know
sw04072-A_028587-029062 if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know

sw04072-B_002772-003546 yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know TV um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like
sw04072-B_003546-004132 yeah [noise] what [noise] what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
sw04072-B_004839-005286 yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to like an all news station to get any news at all
sw04072-B_005951-006592 well i- i really don't like about TV especially local news as compared to like national news is just
sw04072-B_006592-007022 [noise] um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed
sw04072-B_007022-007176 and you know it's
sw04072-B_007176-007640 it's more like the news shows is now i[s]- is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
sw04072-B_007640-008537 or like the news because they would always have you know the the wonderful investigative reports you know is is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know
sw04072-B_008847-008980 um-hum
sw04072-B_009240-009536 yeah also also i have the observation with um
sw04072-B_009536-009863 with the press is that like any any stories that
sw04072-B_009863-010529 i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life
sw04072-B_010529-010984 you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had
sw04072-B_010984-011636 more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
sw04072-B_011636-011826 it's something wrong
sw04072-B_012159-012278 um-hum
sw04072-B_013035-013146 um-hum
sw04072-B_013622-013738 um-hum

sw04072-B_015215-015564 newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know
sw04072-B_015564-016119 [noise] read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and
sw04072-B_017091-017523 was that like [vocalized-noise] he like started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something
sw04072-B_017639-017757 um-hum

sw04072-B_018958-019075 um-hum
sw04072-B_019340-019648 oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know [vocalized-noise]
sw04072-B_019648-020193 you know Channel X gives you the best coverage [noise] you know we were on the scene with our team players you know
sw04072-B_020490-020591 um-hum
sw04072-B_020696-020775 uh-huh
sw04072-B_020876-020981 uh-huh
sw04072-B_020981-021357 they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
sw04072-B_022936-023071 yeah
sw04072-B_023239-023367 yeah i have
sw04072-B_023367-023804 you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
sw04072-B_023804-024232 um [noise] you know even the national news i just find it to be you know
sw04072-B_024232-024435 very watered down very
sw04072-B_024796-024924 um
sw04072-B_025058-025409 i fou[nd]- [vocalized-noise] i found it very one sided
sw04072-B_025409-025562 um
sw04072-B_025675-026029 you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
sw04072-B_026138-026865 um you know you know not saying that we shou[ld]- that we that we definitely should have been there or we shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know
sw04072-B_027379-027502 um-hum
sw04072-B_027678-027796 um-hum
sw04072-B_028437-028551 um-hum
sw04072-B_028930-029049 um-hum
sw04072-B_029229-029602 yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that
sw04072-B_029602-030007 the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
sw04073-A_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04073-A_000019-000375 okay i guess we're recording now so
sw04073-A_000375-000587 i think they could uh
sw04073-A_000587-001347 uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff
sw04073-A_001347-001901 and then they get paid for recycling it so [laughter] i don't know
sw04073-A_001901-002175 if that's very fair or not
sw04073-A_003226-003343 um
sw04073-A_003455-003541 oh
sw04073-A_005073-005197 yeah
sw04073-A_006167-006327 yeah well that's
sw04073-A_007270-007472 [laughter] that's for sure
sw04073-A_007581-007672 uh
sw04073-A_007880-008764 well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to Wal-Mart because they use to have a recycling bin
sw04073-A_008764-009317 and but they got rid of them because there's a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so
sw04073-A_010440-010568 yeah
sw04073-A_011277-011370 yeah
sw04073-A_013717-014270 yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all
sw04073-A_014382-014972 or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just
sw04073-A_014972-015136 [vocalized-noise]
sw04073-A_016139-016282 oh yeah
sw04073-A_016591-016711 [vocalized-noise]

sw04073-A_021683-022506 yeah and uh an[d]- you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just
sw04073-A_022902-023009 yeah
sw04073-A_023450-023690 yeah that's
sw04073-A_024850-024957 yeah

sw04073-A_028752-028858 yeah
sw04073-A_029010-029095 um
sw04073-B_000000-000055 [noise]
sw04073-B_000241-000324 yeah
sw04073-B_001278-001406 yeah
sw04073-B_002199-002335 well
sw04073-B_002335-003046 Dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month
sw04073-B_003046-003299 is what we are going to have to pay
sw04073-B_003299-004154 uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid
sw04073-B_004154-005111 maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and
sw04073-B_005111-005607 something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and
sw04073-B_005607-006235 nowadays it's like i i can't find one place that's going to take everything
sw04073-B_006235-007320 and i am trying to recycle my ki[tchen]- my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and that's not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way
sw04073-B_007434-007580 of
sw04073-B_007580-007890 doing that but uh
sw04073-B_008698-008834 yeah
sw04073-B_009249-009778 and they just got rid of them well Kroger's uh at least in Dallas Kroger's
sw04073-B_009778-010238 will pay for aluminum and will collect
sw04073-B_010238-010487 the glass and the plastic
sw04073-B_010487-011275 but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard
sw04073-B_011275-012379 and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there
sw04073-B_012379-013790 so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but it's you know i have to run around town to get [laughter-my] [laughter-stuff] [laughter-recycled]
sw04073-B_014232-014450 yeah uh
sw04073-B_014996-015985 well i use to it use to be a good deal us to gi[ve]- instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and
sw04073-B_015985-016634 they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them
sw04073-B_016634-017362 some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and
sw04073-B_017362-017566 but know it's just
sw04073-B_017566-018245 you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but
sw04073-B_018245-019192 you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise
sw04073-B_019192-020444 that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle
sw04073-B_020444-021663 you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get [laughter-recycled]
sw04073-B_022471-023367 well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff
sw04073-B_023517-024888 yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance
sw04073-B_024888-025450 and to define recycle paper as paper that includes
sw04073-B_025450-025593 you know
sw04073-B_025700-026092 material that had actually been used as paper before
sw04073-B_026092-027112 one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends
sw04073-B_027112-027624 you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes
sw04073-B_027624-028777 well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber
sw04073-B_028777-029044 and they call that recycled paper
sw04073-B_029044-029620 you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to
sw04073-B_029759-029907 you know how to clean up [vocalized-noise]

sw04074-B_019413-019866 was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and
sw04074-B_020216-020603 um we i would we um
sw04074-B_020603-020970 we had a dog that was a um
sw04074-B_020970-021468 mix between a an Alaskan Malamute and a Labrador
sw04074-B_021468-022357 and [vocalized-noise] i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him and we
sw04074-B_022357-023131 when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten
sw04074-B_023131-023770 he was jus[t]- he was just too big um the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school
sw04074-B_023770-025011 and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just the[re]- you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post
sw04074-B_025011-026353 so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville and they have um
sw04074-B_026353-027058 i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
sw04074-B_027058-027514 so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him
sw04074-B_027514-027666 um
sw04074-B_027666-027994 because_1 he's had him for six or seven years we we've
sw04074-B_028096-029293 saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life
sw04074-B_029293-029759 just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great great dog
sw04075-A_000000-001163 [vocalized-noise] this recycling it's uh i don't know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh they have a trial section that uh
sw04075-A_001163-002146 part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out
sw04075-A_002146-002643 i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that [laughter-though]
sw04075-A_003880-003983 uh-huh
sw04075-A_005362-005486 uh-huh
sw04075-A_006897-007031 uh-huh
sw04075-A_007383-007499 yes
sw04075-A_007706-007807 uh-huh
sw04075-A_007999-008227 [noise]
sw04075-A_008610-008720 uh-huh
sw04075-A_008883-009046 [laughter]
sw04075-A_009702-009822 uh-huh
sw04075-A_010354-011512 oh that's inter[esting]- the grocery stores here have usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things
sw04075-A_011662-011811 uh-huh
sw04075-A_012128-012646 we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here
sw04075-A_012646-012985 but i don't i would not know where to take glass
sw04075-A_013277-014696 oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place
sw04075-A_015475-015603 um-hum
sw04075-A_016001-016433 yes i know and we have that problem [laughter] but uh
sw04075-A_017762-017878 uh-huh
sw04075-A_019012-019147 i see
sw04075-A_020511-020634 uh-huh
sw04075-A_020793-020926 hum
sw04075-A_021166-021257 yes
sw04075-A_021905-022072 oh that's a good idea
sw04075-A_022702-022854 oh
sw04075-A_022854-023499 but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil
sw04075-A_024655-024755 uh-huh
sw04075-A_024755-024862 uh-huh
sw04075-A_026390-026548 huh
sw04075-A_026704-026890 right uh-huh uh-huh
sw04075-A_028391-028564 my goodness
sw04075-A_029324-029863 huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh
sw04075-B_000000-000070 [noise]
sw04075-B_000070-000154 so
sw04075-B_002108-002224 right
sw04075-B_002640-002921 right here in Philadelphia the
sw04075-B_002921-003941 city for residential customers has certain they [vocalized-noise] had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers
sw04075-B_003941-004898 and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list
sw04075-B_004898-005477 but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
sw04075-B_005477-006054 you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your
sw04075-B_006054-006988 bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood
sw04075-B_006988-007531 and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh
sw04075-B_007531-007737 it use to be a firehouse
sw04075-B_007737-008660 but they're trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student
sw04075-B_008660-008973 and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
sw04075-B_008973-009742 so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic
sw04075-B_009742-010402 and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing
sw04075-B_011449-012043 right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
sw04075-B_012043-012152 um
sw04075-B_012937-013336 uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that
sw04075-B_014690-015569 right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from um a standpoint of making new paper to recycle
sw04075-B_015569-016097 but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
sw04075-B_016319-016574 down home i know my folks
sw04075-B_016574-016699 um
sw04075-B_016699-017767 live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
sw04075-B_017767-019080 so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they'll just won't have to build landfills as often
sw04075-B_019080-020065 another things that they are doing not at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and
sw04075-B_020065-020573 that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
sw04075-B_020573-020844 from the miscellaneous paper
sw04075-B_020844-021191 and well they also [vocalized-noise] recycle aluminum cans
sw04075-B_021191-021991 they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
sw04075-B_021991-022705 and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
sw04075-B_023432-024790 oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my o[il]- my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years
sw04075-B_024790-025444 and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this
sw04075-B_025444-026454 mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy w[ould]- would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts
sw04075-B_026454-027439 so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store won't even
sw04075-B_027439-027909 they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
sw04075-B_027909-028434 and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
sw04075-B_028434-029354 so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law but you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself
sw04076-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04076-A_000027-000419 so uh have you personally been involved in any trial by jury
sw04076-A_000521-000608 uh
sw04076-A_000608-000796 [laughter]
sw04076-A_000916-001042 uh-huh
sw04076-A_001199-001831 yeah i was called uh once and i actually sat on a jury and it took a few weeks
sw04076-A_001831-002195 the case was suppose to the judge predicted it would take a few days
sw04076-A_002195-002726 and it just stretched out and stretched out and uh it was kind of interesting
sw04076-A_002726-003531 to uh in a in a in a way that kind of satisfied my uh or that pandered to my nosiness
sw04076-A_003531-003995 -[be]cau[se]- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other
sw04076-A_003995-004426 and uh you were invited to you know pass judgement on them
sw04076-A_004426-004576 [laughter]
sw04076-A_005037-005357 well in this case we determined the award
sw04076-A_005357-006231 um it was two fellows a bunch of money had had uh passed from one to the other and we had to decide uh
sw04076-A_006231-006673 was it -[w]as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back
sw04076-A_006673-007564 uh was it you know what was it and if it was something if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe
sw04076-A_007564-007811 and not only how much was
sw04076-A_007811-008251 how much did they owe but on top of that did we want to penalize them_1
sw04076-A_008251-008399 uh
sw04076-A_009392-009522 um-hum
sw04076-A_010097-010204 uh-huh
sw04076-A_010500-010753 well that's certainly what they're trying to do right
sw04076-A_010753-011054 uh at least there are two of them
sw04076-A_011054-011321 uh knocking off
sw04076-A_011321-011888 i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them
sw04076-A_011888-012449 so maybe maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with
sw04076-A_012551-012682 maybe
sw04076-A_013271-013686 it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better
sw04076-A_014227-014390 [laughter]
sw04076-A_015549-016557 [noise] yeah that seems like uh it seems like you'd have to ig[nore]- either ignore that i mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an opinion
sw04076-A_016969-017100 uh-huh
sw04076-A_017299-017450 uh-huh
sw04076-A_018259-018451 they got to have a problem
sw04076-A_019014-019195 yeah yeah
sw04076-A_020295-021426 yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing
sw04076-A_022202-022325 uh-huh
sw04076-A_023014-023282 right i mean you want people who are
sw04076-A_023282-023511 engaged [laughter]
sw04076-A_023849-023975 uh-huh
sw04076-A_024086-024404 uh well tha[t]- that was one nice thing about the civil case
sw04076-A_024404-024650 is that it it was nothing that
sw04076-A_024650-025091 had shown up in the papers you know it was just two guys the
sw04076-A_025091-025657 what they the only thing they looked for was if you had been in a similar situation yourself
sw04076-A_025657-025837 and i guess they figured you
sw04076-A_025837-025997 you know
sw04076-A_025997-026549 you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with
sw04076-A_027410-027964 it does seem like the judge has a lot of power in the first place and why give him this part also
sw04076-A_029032-029193 [laughter-uh-huh]
sw04076-B_000000-000025 [noise]
sw04076-B_000214-001252 uh no i've never been [noise] called for jury duty which i'm kind of glad for i think it it'd be [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] nice to actually experience it uh but no i haven't i have never how about_1 you
sw04076-B_001765-001887 really
sw04076-B_002134-002262 uh-huh
sw04076-B_002657-002781 uh-huh
sw04076-B_003450-003601 right
sw04076-B_003942-004082 uh-huh
sw04076-B_004359-004475 right
sw04076-B_004475-004989 so when you did it does the jury actually uh d[etermine]- determine the sentence
sw04076-B_005300-005432 uh-huh
sw04076-B_005913-006025 uh-huh
sw04076-B_006025-006223 [noise]
sw04076-B_006604-006742 uh-huh
sw04076-B_007503-007640 uh-huh
sw04076-B_008172-008322 uh-huh
sw04076-B_008322-009466 well it seems like the the whole process i don't know a whole lot about it but one thing that i would think is is when the attorneys actually go through the selection of the jury process
sw04076-B_009466-010534 seems to me that that would that kind of biase[s]- i mean they have control over well we want this person and we don't want this person here and it seems like that could kind of bias the case toward you know their client
sw04076-B_010676-010812 right
sw04076-B_011050-011191 right
sw04076-B_011808-011983 right which
sw04076-B_012404-012594 an equal balance
sw04076-B_012696-013491 i- i don't know the the whole process i it's a good process i mean it i gue[ss]- our country's based on [laughter] trial [laughter-by] [laughter-jury]
sw04076-B_013597-014315 yeah i really do also i mean the forefathers whoe[ver]- whoever came up with the idea s[urely]- they were surely thinking a lot harder than i can think [laughter]
sw04076-B_014315-015651 but [laughter-uh] it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the Manuel Noriega trial i don't see how they could have found anybody in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case
sw04076-B_016485-017545 yeah it is that's that's one of the things that's the reason why they will often change venues of court and stuff like that to get a jury which doesn't have any any uh bias towards the case
sw04076-B_017545-018364 and it it uh it just seems like [laughter-sometimes] the people that they're going to end up with have got to be just your basic you know schmucks
sw04076-B_018364-019123 yeah it['s]- to not know [laughter-anything] about you know or not have formed any type of opinion about some of these large major cases that we've been having lately
sw04076-B_019123-020445 it just seems like tho[se]- i guess that's the one thing that i [laughter-would] think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just
sw04076-B_021167-021351 that's right be[cause]-
sw04076-B_021351-022744 because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the people themselves well either they sit in a little hole you know for all their life and don't hear about anything going on in the world and i don't see how somebody like that is going to be a very good uh
sw04076-B_022744-023157 i don't kn[ow]- f[orm]- form be able to form a very coherent opinion about
sw04076-B_023335-023907 r[ight]- [laughter-yeah] [laughter-right] and that seems to be the opposite of what they they actually have to look for
sw04076-B_024007-024102 so
sw04076-B_024338-024451 uh-huh
sw04076-B_024777-024895 right
sw04076-B_025506-025619 uh-huh
sw04076-B_025619-025731 right
sw04076-B_026185-026302 uh-huh
sw04076-B_026425-027501 right and as far as the i don't think that the uh sentencing should be left up to the judge because that just that w[ould]- that gives too much power to any one person
sw04076-B_027696-027813 right
sw04076-B_027913-029101 yeah that just i mean for for one person i'm s[ure]- sure they have studied the law and ha[ve]- been involved in it for so long but still i think it's this is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind of a joke
sw04076-B_029101-029955 but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones the crime was against society it ought to be society as a whole you know tha[t]- uh as represented by the jury
sw04077-A_000000-000165 [noise] how do you feel about gun control
sw04077-A_000552-000654 um
sw04077-A_001026-001148 uh-huh
sw04077-A_001392-001509 uh-huh
sw04077-A_001988-002398 [noise] well don't you think that you know just having you know some
sw04077-A_002398-002982 you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know
sw04077-A_002982-003403 you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry
sw04077-A_003403-003491 i mean
sw04077-A_003751-003913 it varies from State to State
sw04077-A_003913-004082 there is no national
sw04077-A_004456-004826 uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon
sw04077-A_004935-005143 you know or on probation or [vocalized-noise] you know
sw04077-A_005143-005331 other obvious things like that
sw04077-A_005331-005926 uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before
sw04077-A_005926-006538 [noise] you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun
sw04077-A_007417-007541 uh
sw04077-A_007541-007921 uh yes i'd probably i'd probably say about a five
sw04077-A_007921-008033 [laughter]
sw04077-A_008033-008349 [laughter] seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know
sw04077-A_008881-009030 uh-huh
sw04077-A_009350-009482 uh-huh
sw04077-A_009811-010163 uh-huh [noise] well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like
sw04077-A_010163-011035 you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
sw04077-A_011136-011658 well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing you know p[er]- per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States
sw04077-A_011658-011850 uh
sw04077-A_011850-012830 [noise] you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the United States has you know had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long
sw04077-A_012830-013099 that i think you know if you were introduced
sw04077-A_013099-013309 you know any controls
sw04077-A_013309-013796 it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already
sw04077-A_013796-014098 you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem
sw04077-A_014379-014492 uh
sw04077-A_014648-015419 i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up
sw04077-A_015419-015535 uh
sw04077-A_015535-015699 um-hum
sw04077-A_015699-016427 i mean like i think you know in the [vocalized-noise] i mean i- i think we have been like ranked in like one of the top three for murders in the last few years
sw04077-A_016618-016690 uh-huh
sw04077-A_016794-017222 no i've i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something
sw04077-A_017222-017597 i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun [vocalized-noise] just for protecting myself
sw04077-A_017597-018102 you know from you know burglar type thing like i do kind of live in the downtown area
sw04077-A_018102-018435 you know and shotguns are really good because you know they're
sw04077-A_018435-018896 [noise] i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
sw04077-A_018896-019107 uh and you know you
sw04077-A_019215-020068 yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
sw04077-A_020068-020619 they are probably going to miss the person and they're going sh[oot]- and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit hit someone you know
sw04077-A_020619-021462 i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever
sw04077-A_021462-022328 you pretty you pretty much stop them and you don't have to w[orry]- you know y[ou]- and then and then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
sw04077-A_022808-022927 uh-huh
sw04077-A_023140-023252 uh-huh
sw04077-A_023574-023681 uh-huh
sw04077-A_023857-023967 uh-huh
sw04077-A_024144-024656 yeah that that's they yeah that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know
sw04077-A_024656-025328 if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you
sw04077-A_025328-025829 you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then
sw04077-A_025969-026176 you know and and well i mean
sw04077-A_026176-027150 you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that [laughter-you're] [laughter-a] [laughter-real] danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know
sw04077-A_027150-027331 stop you [laughter]
sw04077-A_027569-027683 uh-huh
sw04077-A_027937-028051 uh-huh
sw04077-A_028164-028266 um
sw04077-A_028940-029218 yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something
sw04077-A_029388-029499 uh-huh
sw04077-B_000000-000115 [noise]
sw04077-B_000115-000327 well uh
sw04077-B_000327-000563 i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed
sw04077-B_000563-001036 but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns
sw04077-B_001036-001481 and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago
sw04077-B_001481-002083 but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them_1 how you can uh i mean prevent that
sw04077-B_003346-003737 yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now
sw04077-B_003854-003964 um
sw04077-B_004074-004527 but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
sw04077-B_004777-004898 yeah
sw04077-B_006525-006880 huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary
sw04077-B_006880-007398 so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
sw04077-B_007843-008033 [laughter-that's] [laughter-where] i would probably be
sw04077-B_008374-008950 well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better
sw04077-B_008950-009870 because i mean i do think that some people need them_1 and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them_1 wanting to have them_1 but then again it's just like all those nutcases out there
sw04077-B_010998-011129 it has
sw04077-B_011129-011261 because [vocalized-noise]
sw04077-B_011654-011780 hum
sw04077-B_013624-013760 yeah
sw04077-B_014060-014343 well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta
sw04077-B_015363-015579 yeah i know Dallas is
sw04077-B_016428-016785 i don't know if Dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun
sw04077-B_017647-017755 uh-huh
sw04077-B_018034-018174 yeah
sw04077-B_018828-018968 that's true
sw04077-B_020355-020686 [laughter]
sw04077-B_021261-021378 yeah
sw04077-B_021495-021608 well
sw04077-B_022312-022843 well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun
sw04077-B_022843-023200 but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
sw04077-B_023200-023626 so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because
sw04077-B_023626-024230 you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it
sw04077-B_025150-025277 [vocalized-noise]
sw04077-B_025277-025554 and they get it from you uh-huh
sw04077-B_025887-026021 set them off
sw04077-B_027276-027402 yeah
sw04077-B_027402-027668 [noise] well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know
sw04077-B_027668-028238 i don't want it if i don't know how to oper[ate]- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility
sw04077-B_028238-028403 so
sw04077-B_028403-028647 well well uh
sw04077-B_028647-028940 did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever
sw04077-B_029102-029262 yeah right
sw04077-B_029262-029401 that kind of
sw04077-B_029401-029751 i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns
sw04077-B_029751-029971 i would be scared selling guns to people
sw04078-A_000000-000325 [noise] what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned
sw04078-A_001109-001238 uh-huh
sw04078-A_001538-001654 um-hum
sw04078-A_002550-002960 oh yeah wha[t]- what would be more efficient about it wha[t]- wha[t]-
sw04078-A_003535-003664 uh-huh
sw04078-A_004010-004141 uh-huh
sw04078-A_004538-004653 uh-huh
sw04078-A_007284-007431 oh
sw04078-A_007431-008451 i see yeah i- i- i- i uh i was gonna say because_1 i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if
sw04078-A_008451-009005 if i have a if i- i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
sw04078-A_009157-009304 that's true
sw04078-A_009304-009414 hm
sw04078-A_009879-010075 certainly that's a good idea
sw04078-A_010338-010460 yeah
sw04078-A_010661-010793 uh-huh
sw04078-A_011095-011551 well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and
sw04078-A_011551-012302 uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano
sw04078-A_012302-012771 um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up
sw04078-A_012771-013410 where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up
sw04078-A_013410-014188 uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper [noise] uh and uh aluminum and um
sw04078-A_014188-015476 the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
sw04078-A_015588-015915 right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items
sw04078-A_017463-017592 um-hum
sw04078-A_018720-018824 um-hum
sw04078-A_018824-020081 well wh[at]- what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i- i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh
sw04078-A_020081-020511 you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible
sw04078-A_022255-022373 hm
sw04078-A_022373-022484 um-hum
sw04078-A_022915-023024 um-hum
sw04078-A_023304-023501 um-hum um-hum
sw04078-A_024102-024218 um-hum
sw04078-A_024335-024488 well that's good
sw04078-A_024703-024820 yeah
sw04078-A_025477-025618 uh-huh
sw04078-A_026313-027087 do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or
sw04078-A_027403-027504 um-hum
sw04078-A_027763-027883 hm
sw04078-A_028030-028133 um-hum
sw04078-A_029400-029556 sure yeah
sw04078-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04078-B_000272-001175 well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
sw04078-B_001175-001999 uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um
sw04078-B_001999-002623 less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i- i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in [laughter]
sw04078-B_002623-002743 um
sw04078-B_002891-004083 [noise] well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or [vocalized-noise] a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
sw04078-B_004083-004592 you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them_1
sw04078-B_004592-005354 and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
sw04078-B_005354-006307 and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
sw04078-B_006307-007343 uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
sw04078-B_007343-007635 kind of type thing so
sw04078-B_008186-008353 right
sw04078-B_008353-008563 but [noise]
sw04078-B_008887-009934 right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
sw04078-B_009934-010369 so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and
sw04078-B_010369-010752 i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible [laughter]
sw04078-B_010752-011160 so um what else do they do in the Dallas area
sw04078-B_012241-012372 uh-huh
sw04078-B_012743-012902 hm
sw04078-B_015495-015700 anything extra
sw04078-B_015869-016577 that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where
sw04078-B_016577-017144 you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh [noise]
sw04078-B_017144-017868 there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um
sw04078-B_017868-018802 [noise] so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most
sw04078-B_018802-018976 uh but
sw04078-B_019461-019601 [noise]
sw04078-B_020047-020267 find a place [noise]
sw04078-B_020473-020700 well um
sw04078-B_020700-020916 [noise] uh
sw04078-B_020916-021404 they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans
sw04078-B_021404-022478 those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town
sw04078-B_022478-023464 um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
sw04078-B_023464-024181 um but i- i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments
sw04078-B_024181-024338 so
sw04078-B_024338-024751 [noise] i do that i think people are becoming more aware
sw04078-B_024751-026054 you know of of the waste and you know i- i like to see you know y[ou]- you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
sw04078-B_026054-026374 you know like maybe it's making an impact [laughter]
sw04078-B_027042-028086 i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
sw04078-B_028086-029280 so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start
sw04078-B_029280-029473 packaging it that way
sw04078-B_029473-029628 so um
sw04078-B_029628-029840 you know they're getting away from the styro[foam]-
sw04079-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04079-A_000049-000355 okay_1 so Frank what uh type of uh
sw04079-A_000355-000599 budget do you or your family have
sw04079-A_003503-003681 right that's
sw04079-A_003681-004428 that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have [laughter] i'm single so i guess
sw04079-A_004428-004897 uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
sw04079-A_004897-005048 right i don't need to [laughter]
sw04079-A_005048-005429 i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
sw04079-A_005429-006093 um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh
sw04079-A_006093-006222 i kind of
sw04079-A_006222-006750 i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month
sw04079-A_006750-007456 and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
sw04079-A_011234-011363 um-hum
sw04079-A_013141-013253 um-hum
sw04079-A_013922-014047 right
sw04079-A_014193-014347 yeah that's
sw04079-A_014347-014839 i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m[edium]- uh medium or longer range i just have a
sw04079-A_014839-015450 maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car
sw04079-A_015450-016045 so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to
sw04079-A_016045-016301 to [vocalized-noise] put a little bit away and
sw04079-A_016301-016610 you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever
sw04079-A_017653-017801 right
sw04079-A_019495-019616 um-hum
sw04079-A_020150-020256 hm
sw04079-A_020651-020783 right
sw04079-A_021278-021385 right
sw04079-A_021385-021601 have you thought about uh leasing
sw04079-A_022054-022175 i see
sw04079-A_022465-022609 right
sw04079-A_022609-023100 but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that
sw04079-A_023278-024563 you know typically you [vocalized-noise] if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
sw04079-A_025921-027060 that's right [laughter] yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had ex[penses]- a number of expenses
sw04079-A_027060-027234 but uh i'm hoping that
sw04079-A_027234-027528 m[ost]- most of them_1 were just kind of uh you know the
sw04079-A_027528-028237 as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year
sw04079-A_028237-028611 and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again [laughter]
sw04079-A_029373-029508 right
sw04079-A_029764-029939 right what line of work are you in
sw04079-B_000000-000040 [noise]
sw04079-B_000040-000607 [vocalized-noise]
sw04079-B_000607-001750 well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh
sw04079-B_001750-001947 my wife uh
sw04079-B_001947-002415 has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and
sw04079-B_002415-003553 uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month
sw04079-B_004015-004164 uh-huh
sw04079-B_004164-004313 uh-huh
sw04079-B_004758-004961 really don't need to [laughter]
sw04079-B_005204-005321 uh
sw04079-B_005321-005467 that's right
sw04079-B_005928-006048 um-hum
sw04079-B_006717-006838 uh-huh
sw04079-B_007387-007514 right
sw04079-B_007649-008694 well i found that uh you know thing[s]- as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to v[ery]- have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh
sw04079-B_008694-009527 you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
sw04079-B_009527-010924 uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -[w]ill come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance
sw04079-B_010924-012159 uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
sw04079-B_012159-013201 what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
sw04079-B_013201-014017 and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
sw04079-B_014017-014250 and i guess that's a way of budgeting
sw04079-B_015382-015502 um-hum
sw04079-B_016542-016689 uh-huh
sw04079-B_016801-017747 yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them_1 but for for keeping them_1 on the road too
sw04079-B_017747-017908 um
sw04079-B_017908-018437 you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so
sw04079-B_018437-019571 we're on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
sw04079-B_019571-020213 so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so
sw04079-B_020213-020366 it's
sw04079-B_020366-021022 y[ou]- you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that
sw04079-B_021022-021449 uh you're on[ly]- you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying
sw04079-B_021600-022696 well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so
sw04079-B_022798-022922 [noise]
sw04079-B_023151-023357 yeah i guess uh
sw04079-B_024000-024140 uh-huh
sw04079-B_024500-024616 right
sw04079-B_024717-025142 yeah you're right um i- i have uh been know to keep
sw04079-B_025142-026027 trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them_1 you know
sw04079-B_026027-026195 [laughter]
sw04079-B_026914-027059 uh-huh
sw04079-B_028170-028315 um-hum
sw04079-B_028564-029468 those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
sw04079-B_029468-029838 so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month
sw04080-A_000000-000058 [noise]
sw04080-A_000058-000301 okay what's your view
sw04080-A_000301-000494 what's your view
sw04080-A_001027-001187 [laughter-yeah] [laughter]
sw04080-A_001187-001373 yeah that's true
sw04080-A_001373-001889 you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
sw04080-A_001889-002186 i don't know coming from Texas you're probably
sw04080-A_002186-002796 i don't know i- i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
sw04080-A_002796-002940 yeah
sw04080-A_003185-003404 oh you're just living down there
sw04080-A_003404-003550 yeah
sw04080-A_003712-003824 oh well
sw04080-A_003824-003938 [laughter]
sw04080-A_004061-004190 yeah well
sw04080-A_004190-004814 i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and
sw04080-A_004814-005484 man there's no [laughter-way] there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know [vocalized-noise]
sw04080-A_005631-005945 yeah it doesn't sit with me very well [laughter]
sw04080-A_005945-006377 i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know
sw04080-A_006377-006758 yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and
sw04080-A_006758-007174 i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year
sw04080-A_007174-007501 and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
sw04080-A_007501-008091 and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then
sw04080-A_008091-008390 of course there's the hunting issue so
sw04080-A_008390-008662 yeah that's good but what do you do Jeff
sw04080-A_009251-009368 oh yeah
sw04080-A_009368-009521 all right
sw04080-A_009647-009751 yeah
sw04080-A_009857-010161 i'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here
sw04080-A_010161-010699 so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or
sw04080-A_011420-011669 yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit
sw04080-A_012234-012337 yeah
sw04080-A_012439-013005 all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while
sw04080-A_013005-013314 and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but
sw04080-A_013314-013728 i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh
sw04080-A_013728-013889 for a complete
sw04080-A_013889-014039 that's right
sw04080-A_014039-014312 i guess i am about eight or [laughter-nine] [laughter]
sw04080-A_014460-014709 yeah no doubt about it but uh
sw04080-A_015178-015315 yeah
sw04080-A_015315-015778 yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it
sw04080-A_015778-016020 t[o]- to people that that i don't know [vocalized-noise]
sw04080-A_016020-016820 they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period
sw04080-A_016820-017183 where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually
sw04080-A_017183-017639 uh i know it's this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week
sw04080-A_017639-018231 and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea
sw04080-A_018231-018382 uh
sw04080-A_018382-018591 and that's i don't know
sw04080-A_018591-019323 that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always will be able to get around
sw04080-A_019423-019601 yeah it's one of those things
sw04080-A_019601-019742 but uh
sw04080-A_019742-019900 i don't know i guess
sw04080-A_019900-020344 i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like
sw04080-A_020344-020631 i'm not real sure why anybody would need
sw04080-A_020631-020820 a fully automatic weapon
sw04080-A_020937-021565 you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
sw04080-A_021565-021670 [vocalized-noise]
sw04080-A_022362-022585 it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
sw04080-A_022585-022681 [laughter]
sw04080-A_022681-022816 you know it's like
sw04080-A_022816-023167 what can you do with that that you can't do
sw04080-A_023167-023743 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot clip
sw04080-A_023743-023963 you know you might do the same thing
sw04080-A_023963-024397 and so it's like i don't know i[t]- it it does it takes the sport out of it
sw04080-A_024397-024634 for me i would much rather have a bow any time
sw04080-A_024634-024715 [laughter]
sw04080-A_024715-025411 yeah i- i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know
sw04080-A_025411-025841 but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
sw04080-A_025841-026114 but uh i don't know
sw04080-A_026114-026342 anyway that's about where i stand
sw04080-A_026342-026484 [laughter]
sw04080-A_026484-026653 you uh
sw04080-A_026653-026931 have you uh you eaten yet or whatever
sw04080-A_027047-027207 is it seven o'clock there

sw04080-A_027844-028218 oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's
sw04080-A_028218-029093 around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are
sw04080-A_029093-029751 people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so
sw04080-A_029751-030007 i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to
sw04080-B_000000-000117 [noise]
sw04080-B_000117-000255 all right
sw04080-B_000255-000406 huh
sw04080-B_000406-000610 [noise] well
sw04080-B_000610-001103 i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns [laughter]
sw04080-B_001103-001287 personally
sw04080-B_001287-001433 i mean
sw04080-B_001764-001971 that's right that's right

sw04080-B_013763-014022 one for a total ban and uh
sw04080-B_014213-014468 yeah i- i'll agree with you there
sw04080-B_014578-014717 i mean
sw04080-B_014717-015198 if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they [laughter-can't]

sw04080-B_021847-022130 i mean a semiautomatic
sw04080-B_022233-022360 i guess that's
sw04080-B_022545-022760 yeah right
sw04080-B_023704-023821 sure
sw04080-B_023922-024031 right
sw04080-B_024696-024838 oh really
sw04080-B_025335-025465 yeah

sw04080-B_027715-027915 how is the weather up there
sw04080-B_028124-028235 is it
sw04080-B_028813-028926 right
sw04080-B_029658-029782 yeah
sw04081-A_000000-000100 [noise]
sw04081-A_000213-000333 okay_1
sw04081-A_001220-001319 um-hum
sw04081-A_001419-001544 um-hum
sw04081-A_002857-002992 um-hum
sw04081-A_003327-003591 um-hum what about glass they have glass
sw04081-A_004604-005264 huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting
sw04081-A_005264-005963 um i mean no[t]- not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um
sw04081-A_005963-006717 they have trash sorting and you know they [vocalized-noise] put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins
sw04081-A_006717-007398 and uh [laughter] i guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like
sw04081-A_007398-007937 they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they [laughter-collect]
sw04081-A_009111-009254 um-hum
sw04081-A_009657-009793 um-hum
sw04081-A_011083-011537 i see so so um do you actually live in Atlanta
sw04081-A_012142-012281 um-hum
sw04081-A_012405-012794 yeah i know the cities are um i think Dekalb
sw04081-A_012897-013191 Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton
sw04081-A_013294-013859 i thought it was i thought it was a K i always thought it was a K but um never mind um
sw04081-A_013859-014299 and uh isn't Fulton what another county that's uh
sw04081-A_014299-014434 um-hum um-hum
sw04081-A_015272-015400 huh
sw04081-A_016011-017044 now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over um more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county
sw04081-A_017544-017686 um-hum
sw04081-A_017913-018048 um-hum
sw04081-A_018937-019064 yeah
sw04081-A_019064-020044 in fact and San Francisco is entirely within the [noise] the the limits of San Francisco County in fact San Francisco County and city have the same city limits
sw04081-A_020044-020463 so that's kind of a weird thing but um
sw04081-A_021204-021345 um-hum
sw04081-A_023085-024126 [laughter] yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it
sw04081-A_024550-024672 huh
sw04081-A_025721-025850 huh
sw04081-A_026537-026670 um-hum
sw04081-A_027299-027421 right
sw04081-A_028296-028408 huh
sw04081-A_028965-029077 huh
sw04081-A_029077-029556 you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um where're you from originally
sw04081-A_029726-029853 no kidding
sw04081-B_000000-000246 [noise] [vocalized-noise] i'll talk about my city a little bit
sw04081-B_000246-001053 [vocalized-noise] i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh
sw04081-B_001053-002096 uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers
sw04081-B_002096-003385 so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim tha[t]- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans
sw04081-B_003544-003993 uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area
sw04081-B_003993-004652 at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass
sw04081-B_005227-005351 uh-huh
sw04081-B_006704-006838 right
sw04081-B_007709-008460 right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is
sw04081-B_008569-009722 it seems like the paper sorting you st[ill]- we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department
sw04081-B_009722-011168 so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual i[t's]- it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything
sw04081-B_011510-012472 uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta
sw04081-B_012731-013600 you well that's Dekalb actually it's [vocalized-noise] you're right it's spelled that way D D E C A L B but that that's Dekalb [laughter]
sw04081-B_014177-015308 right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper
sw04081-B_015308-015650 uh but there's no concentrated concept
sw04081-B_015650-016123 uh on that sense uh we have uh
sw04081-B_016945-017999 yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively
sw04081-B_017999-019196 uh but yeah i mea[n]- i- i uh most cities tend to stay most[ly]- mostly i[n]- [vocalized-noise] in in one county so you know
sw04081-B_019992-020102 [laughter]
sw04081-B_020102-020226 right
sw04081-B_020395-021548 anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we ge[t]- we get some help with the papers uh ou[r]- our our uh
sw04081-B_021548-022799 uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them_1 in a bag they will put them_1 in a separate area into into the uh uh
sw04081-B_022799-023286 uh ga[rbage]- garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that
sw04081-B_023286-023359 [laughter]
sw04081-B_023937-024760 well it pre[tty]- well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh
sw04081-B_024760-025383 the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them_1 off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it
sw04081-B_025383-025755 uh but they but they they do indicate that service
sw04081-B_025755-026603 i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container
sw04081-B_026603-027316 that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores
sw04081-B_027316-027738 uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier
sw04081-B_027738-029103 i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that
sw04081-B_029476-029783 well i'm actually originally from Dayton Ohio
sw04081-B_029783-029853 but that's
sw04082-A_000000-001208 uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the Houston Chronicle and sometimes i'll read uh like the uh
sw04082-A_001208-002239 uh Wall Street Journal or The New York Times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it um how about_1 you do you you mostly get news from TV or newspaper
sw04082-A_003463-004446 oh uh that's interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting
sw04082-A_005675-005872 [noise] oh i[s]-
sw04082-A_005872-006504 [noise] is it is it the AP news wire or is it uh something that's that's a little bit different from that
sw04082-A_006938-008186 uh okay so that that that's interesting okay yeah i've had i had access in the past to uh [noise] uh the AP news wire and i found that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news
sw04082-A_008186-008475 um i've never uh used the Dow Jones news wire
sw04082-A_008475-009736 but uh yeah it uh do you do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
sw04082-A_011537-011661 yeah [noise]
sw04082-A_013125-014099 uh interesting in what way in like in sort of like uh a qua[lity]- a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
sw04082-A_015073-015485 g[o]- you well you won't offend me so go [laughter-ahead] [laughter-and] [laughter-say]
sw04082-A_015485-015781 yeah like li[beral]- a liberal type of bias
sw04082-A_015781-015933 yeah
sw04082-A_016152-016322 yeah yeah
sw04082-A_016703-016869 yeah yeah
sw04082-A_017902-018436 yeah yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but
sw04082-A_019054-019191 [laughter-yeah]
sw04082-A_019408-020129 yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things
sw04082-A_021156-021363 yeah yeah
sw04082-A_021363-021502 yeah
sw04082-A_021502-021588 [noise]
sw04082-A_023511-023650 hm
sw04082-A_023792-024056 hm that's disturbing uh
sw04082-A_024056-024392 i haven't really noticed them doing that but
sw04082-A_024392-025556 whatever again i don't watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more um i don't you know but i don't usually yeah
sw04082-A_025826-026629 [laughter-yeah] did you did you think that CNN well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just won[der]- i guess
sw04082-A_026629-027350 i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say CNN TV news compared to the three networks
sw04082-A_027350-028264 um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i- i guess you wouldn't [noise] you probably if you just watched it during Gulf War that [laughter-probably] wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
sw04082-A_028879-029005 yeah
sw04082-A_029297-029422 yeah [laughter]
sw04082-B_000000-000106 [noise]
sw04082-B_001988-002707 [noise] ye[ah]- i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks
sw04082-B_002707-003638 however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the Wall Street Journal most everyday
sw04082-B_003932-004962 [noise] uh well w[ell]- Dow Jones for example have a has a uh a news wire and it's uh it's picked up and actually available um at my office
sw04082-B_004962-006088 so it's no fee subscription i'm uh very easy to to read at my leisure and um it's sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics
sw04082-B_006426-007012 [noise] well it's similar to that but it's Dow Jones which is um The Wall Street Journal's news wire
sw04082-B_009720-010366 [noise] um well actually not uh i do uh follow um [noise]
sw04082-B_010366-010555 uh
sw04082-B_010555-010937 [noise] uh i don't know how to how to describe it um [vocalized-noise]
sw04082-B_010937-011840 [noise] so it's a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly [noise] but uh but not um
sw04082-B_011840-013181 but not like Business Week or uh or News Week or or or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however um that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
sw04082-B_014032-014549 [noise] um i- i think that it i think it has to do with [noise] uh [noise]
sw04082-B_014549-015303 [noise] i personally think [noise] i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh [noise] that there's a strong bi[as]-
sw04082-B_015303-015689 there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media
sw04082-B_015689-016546 yeah absolutely a[fter]- after all wh[o]- who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal
sw04082-B_016546-017409 [noise] uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm
sw04082-B_017409-017823 an expert in i find their descriptions to be
sw04082-B_017823-017976 wrong
sw04082-B_017976-018127 and
sw04082-B_018127-018269 it
sw04082-B_018269-019472 that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies
sw04082-B_020048-021449 [noise] i- i think both uh by deliberate um [vocalized-noise] i mean mist[akes]- mistakes of omission or uh [noise] or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have
sw04082-B_021449-022690 [noise] so uh uh well give an example uh y[ou]- y[ou]- we'll go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where they'll show clippings from
sw04082-B_022690-023539 one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you
sw04082-B_023539-024277 which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that
sw04082-B_025271-025915 yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and uh it wa[s]- i did during the Gulf War and it was addictive
sw04082-B_028146-029136 [noise] yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get
sw04082-B_029136-029754 the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on CNN and you w[ould]-
sw04083-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04083-A_000011-000345 so what do you think about uh employers screening
sw04083-A_000345-000702 you know job candidates for drug drug usage
sw04083-A_002003-002150 right
sw04083-A_002891-003325 right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening
sw04083-A_004998-005347 but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it
sw04083-A_006411-006916 right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um
sw04083-A_006916-007835 if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh
sw04083-A_009811-010026 right
sw04083-A_010026-010747 yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um
sw04083-A_012987-014244 that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't
sw04083-A_014244-014657 fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people
sw04083-A_015326-015549 right they can go and
sw04083-A_015983-016727 right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance
sw04083-A_017974-018106 um-hum
sw04083-A_018487-018610 [laughter-true]
sw04083-A_019444-019568 right
sw04083-A_020551-020699 right
sw04083-A_021233-021439 right yeah
sw04083-A_021439-021668 that's true yeah
sw04083-A_021668-022678 i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company
sw04083-A_022678-023323 and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine
sw04083-A_023323-024351 no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing
sw04083-A_025475-025692 um-hum
sw04083-A_027495-027643 right
sw04083-A_027759-027884 well uh
sw04083-A_028044-029011 right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very
sw04083-A_029011-029639 well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems
sw04083-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04083-B_000728-001049 well i can kind of see it both ways because um
sw04083-B_001161-002080 you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs
sw04083-B_002080-002948 that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening
sw04083-B_003366-004357 right i think that we ought to be [vocalized-noise] employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that
sw04083-B_004357-005002 and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would li[ke]- rather have somebody that isn't on drugs
sw04083-B_005295-005904 that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job
sw04083-B_006006-006159 that
sw04083-B_006159-006546 if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get [laughter-it]
sw04083-B_007628-008845 right i guess depends on the job some jobs that de[pend]- on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains
sw04083-B_008845-009163 um things like that but i don't think SEPTA
sw04083-B_009163-010137 actually [laughter] does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs
sw04083-B_010541-010663 right
sw04083-B_010824-010979 but other well i don't know
sw04083-B_011085-011287 every job
sw04083-B_011287-011468 right i guess
sw04083-B_011571-011785 i don't know i'd would
sw04083-B_011785-013040 obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them_1 out there on the street mugging people
sw04083-B_014202-014379 that's right
sw04083-B_014604-015416 that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that
sw04083-B_015416-016049 if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed
sw04083-B_016049-016240 so
sw04083-B_016656-016984 well some perhaps a program but
sw04083-B_017179-018044 i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support
sw04083-B_018044-019168 but on the other si[de]- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they
sw04083-B_019168-019517 especially young people here in Philadelphia
sw04083-B_019517-020189 if they had [vocalized-noise] if they were so busy during the day that when they went
sw04083-B_020189-020595 um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep
sw04083-B_020595-020804 so
sw04083-B_020804-021488 but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them_1 into trouble
sw04083-B_022047-022168 [noise]
sw04083-B_022623-022757 um-hum
sw04083-B_023218-023451 right are you in business
sw04083-B_023736-023849 uh-huh
sw04083-B_024279-025538 right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
sw04083-B_025538-026363 so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and
sw04083-B_026363-026785 you know even at fast food restaurants and um
sw04083-B_026785-026972 field work it's
sw04083-B_026972-027572 the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who
sw04083-B_027572-028210 i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia [vocalized-noise]
sw04083-B_028743-028870 right
sw04083-B_029547-029904 um-hum yeah they can [vocalized-noise]
sw04084-A_000000-000239 [noise] so do you have kids in the public school system
sw04084-A_000399-001242 oh yeah [laughter] well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh
sw04084-A_001242-001720 i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um
sw04084-A_001720-002083 home schooling right now is not an option for us so
sw04084-A_002083-002969 and p[rivate]- and private schools um i don't know [laughter-yeah] so you have to deal with it wh[at]- what you have but um
sw04084-A_002969-003117 um
sw04084-A_003117-003556 i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems
sw04084-A_005499-005642 yeah
sw04084-A_006836-006988 [noise]
sw04084-A_007149-007279 [noise]
sw04084-A_007907-008044 yeah
sw04084-A_008768-009194 yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um
sw04084-A_009194-010354 they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching
sw04084-A_010354-011085 and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with
sw04084-A_011085-011218 um
sw04084-A_011218-012247 you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that
sw04084-A_012247-012954 w[ell]- [noise] well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM
sw04084-A_012954-014021 um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um
sw04084-A_014021-015423 as a lot well i[ndustry]- industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period [noise] with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i w[e]- we went and looked at the
sw04084-A_015423-015735 the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into
sw04084-A_015735-017212 and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like
sw04084-A_017212-018627 um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know
sw04084-A_018627-018754 that don't have
sw04084-A_018754-019479 you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout
sw04084-A_019479-020113 you know his school life if he's of uh you know that things are available to him like the computer that he can
sw04084-A_020113-021328 go off and and teach himself yeah because_1 i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um
sw04084-A_021328-021831 [noise] they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time
sw04084-A_021831-021968 and um
sw04084-A_021968-022172 [laughter] i come back and
sw04084-A_022172-023404 i got a degree in in uh i got a business degree in college and that's the most useless [laughter-degree] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-world] it's like why did they do this to people [noise] and um so you have to you know you have to
sw04084-A_023404-024565 uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to
sw04084-A_024565-025387 to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um
sw04084-A_026755-026891 yeah
sw04084-A_029413-029562 um-hum
sw04084-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04084-B_000182-000621 uh no i don't i'm a college student actually no kids yet
sw04084-B_001086-001208 uh-huh
sw04084-B_001598-001739 right
sw04084-B_001969-002106 uh-huh
sw04084-B_002352-002676 pretty expensive [laughter]
sw04084-B_002890-003025 right
sw04084-B_003501-003653 uh
sw04084-B_003653-004094 i think there's a lot that could be done to improve them_1 i uh
sw04084-B_004094-004701 being that i'm in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just see[ms]- it seems like
sw04084-B_004701-005621 that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that a[re]- that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that
sw04084-B_005621-006444 i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age
sw04084-B_006444-007062 and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your
sw04084-B_007062-007960 your math professors or whate[ver]- whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well [laughter] you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it
sw04084-B_007960-008234 it just seems like that they've
sw04084-B_008234-008769 the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something
sw04084-B_010288-010420 right

sw04084-B_025166-025314 right
sw04084-B_025314-026072 well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of
sw04084-B_026072-026843 hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else
sw04084-B_026843-028060 dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i- i see that they're they're trying to uh
sw04084-B_028060-028668 uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not
sw04084-B_028668-029409 on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and
sw04084-B_029409-029837 as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing
sw04085-A_000000-000009 [noise]
sw04085-A_000009-000135 hi Ed
sw04085-A_000258-000525 do you uh work for a large organization
sw04085-A_001077-001244 wow what do you do
sw04085-A_001244-001367 are you
sw04085-A_001367-001492 i see
sw04085-A_001919-002019 yes
sw04085-A_002134-002371 i'm a computer scientist
sw04085-A_002486-002841 and always concerned about benefits [laughter]
sw04085-A_003026-003149 oh you are
sw04085-A_003554-003717 i see uh
sw04085-A_003896-004481 what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care
sw04085-A_008058-008169 oh yeah
sw04085-A_008169-008291 yeah
sw04085-A_008291-009200 well we've our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider
sw04085-A_009200-009522 and the [laughter] you wouldn't believe the complaints
sw04085-A_009631-010142 because [vocalized-noise] you know you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network
sw04085-A_010142-010808 and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you don't go to a network doctor
sw04085-A_011163-011254 that's right
sw04085-A_011254-011611 that's right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors
sw04085-A_012274-012912 no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better
sw04085-A_012912-013073 when uh
sw04085-A_013073-013347 we are with the preferred provider yes
sw04085-A_018693-019125 have you heard about uh ca[feteria]- the cafeteria plan of benefits
sw04085-A_019541-019678 [laughter]
sw04085-A_019803-020364 well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in see[ing]- in learning more about that because
sw04085-A_020364-021217 uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something [laughter]
sw04085-A_023199-023323 yeah
sw04085-A_023323-023933 yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you
sw04085-A_024703-025118 well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much [laughter]
sw04085-A_025118-025456 [laughter-medical] [laughter-insurance] [laughter-or] [laughter-something] i don't know [laughter]
sw04085-A_025456-025637 [laughter]
sw04085-A_025869-026083 yeah i'm sure but
sw04085-A_026083-026689 uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldn't care about dental insurance
sw04085-A_026952-027034 would you
sw04085-A_027034-027143 i don't know
sw04085-A_028663-028763 yeah
sw04085-A_029542-029644 that's right
sw04085-A_029644-029795 but that you know people like
sw04085-B_000000-000012 [noise]
sw04085-B_000137-000253 hello Carolyn
sw04085-B_000491-001114 yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about six or seven thousand employees
sw04085-B_001258-001762 i'm an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science
sw04085-B_001762-001993 and you work for TI
sw04085-B_001993-002227 and you do
sw04085-B_002346-002434 um-hum
sw04085-B_002762-003573 right well i i'm on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so that's why i checked that topic
sw04085-B_004420-005510 i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um
sw04085-B_005510-005555 [noise]
sw04085-B_005555-006533 yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university
sw04085-B_006533-006857 and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um
sw04085-B_006857-006920 [noise]
sw04085-B_006920-007568 uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh[at]- you know the the uh
sw04085-B_007568-007603 [noise]
sw04085-B_007603-008095 uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly
sw04085-B_009148-009243 uh-huh
sw04085-B_009565-009648 huh
sw04085-B_010097-010191 right
sw04085-B_010601-010694 well
sw04085-B_010694-011207 do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not
sw04085-B_011313-011365 huh
sw04085-B_011614-012408 right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right
sw04085-B_013034-013220 with the preferred provider
sw04085-B_013220-013341 huh
sw04085-B_013341-014630 wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs
sw04085-B_014630-015572 and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh
sw04085-B_015572-016780 you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO
sw04085-B_016780-018073 so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh
sw04085-B_018073-018641 you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh
sw04085-B_019085-019788 yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs
sw04085-B_020323-020419 uh-huh
sw04085-B_020566-020672 uh-huh
sw04085-B_020844-020937 right
sw04085-B_021134-021698 well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh
sw04085-B_021698-023192 if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more
sw04085-B_023372-023454 so
sw04085-B_023833-024721 oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um
sw04085-B_025098-025233 medical care
sw04085-B_025233-025558 [laughter] i don't know about that [laughter]
sw04085-B_025558-026006 you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total
sw04085-B_026006-026141 yeah
sw04085-B_026665-027954 uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to
sw04085-B_027954-028658 uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly
sw04085-B_028658-029578 uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation
sw04086-A_000000-000018 [noise]
sw04086-A_000018-000090 okay_1
sw04086-A_000090-000292 um what do you think
sw04086-A_000824-001088 well that makes a big [laughter-difference] doesn't it [laughter]
sw04086-A_001088-001244 it's kind of like well if they're
sw04086-A_001783-002064 right a little more domestic there
sw04086-A_002064-002933 yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non American and while i'd really like to buy American
sw04086-A_002933-003462 i don't know it just it really depends on reliability for me
sw04086-A_003462-004023 uh i have a Ford right now and it's been a pretty good truck
sw04086-A_004023-004919 but some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of cu[stomer]- uh customer service at least for me
sw04086-A_004919-005288 so it's i don't know i[t's]- it's kind of disappointing
sw04086-A_005288-005402 but
sw04086-A_006688-006806 yeah
sw04086-A_007218-007333 [laughter-yeah]
sw04086-A_007333-007549 [laughter]
sw04086-A_007672-007811 right
sw04086-A_007811-008786 well one of the g[ood]- i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father he's a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years
sw04086-A_008786-009286 and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years
sw04086-A_009286-009672 and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van
sw04086-A_009672-010186 um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but
sw04086-A_010186-011251 i don't know i guess i guess for my next car i'd probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that i'm a college student right now i'm a doctoral student
sw04086-A_011251-012359 and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so [laughter] you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but
sw04086-A_012359-012996 well i guess i don't know i'm i- i think i'll probably buy American but i'm just not real sure you know
sw04086-A_013638-013763 um-hum
sw04086-A_014547-014709 sure and i [vocalized-noise]
sw04086-A_014709-014842 yeah
sw04086-A_014842-015852 and that opens up a whole -[a]nother can of worms i guess Ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California
sw04086-A_015852-015967 you know
sw04086-A_015967-016104 yeah
sw04086-A_016453-017372 um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i
sw04086-A_017473-017742 sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation [vocalized-noise]
sw04086-A_017878-018014 [laughter]
sw04086-A_018549-018845 [laughter]
sw04086-A_018845-019142 i bet they'd have something to say about buying cars huh
sw04086-A_020206-020351 yeah
sw04086-A_020555-020701 oh really
sw04086-A_021192-021349 [laughter]
sw04086-A_021463-021615 how old are they
sw04086-A_021716-021848 oh i see
sw04086-A_021949-022050 uh-huh
sw04086-A_022198-022318 right
sw04086-A_022318-022399 [noise]
sw04086-A_022501-022637 [laughter]
sw04086-A_022893-023004 yeah
sw04086-A_023222-023354 oh yeah
sw04086-A_023455-023747 yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually
sw04086-A_023847-023945 yeah
sw04086-A_024158-025082 yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree
sw04086-A_025082-025750 and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but
sw04086-A_026559-026672 um-hum
sw04086-A_027053-027186 yeah
sw04086-A_027186-027906 it's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately you know it seems like everyone that's a big concern now you know [laughter-it's]
sw04086-A_028319-028443 yeah
sw04086-A_028612-028731 uh-huh
sw04086-A_028951-029099 [laughter]
sw04086-A_029304-029415 yeah
sw04086-B_000000-000042 [noise]
sw04086-B_000311-000917 well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house [laughter]
sw04086-B_001039-001976 we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van
sw04086-B_001976-002149 yeah
sw04086-B_003392-003547 yeah
sw04086-B_005278-006755 well well when we [vocalized-noise] i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones
sw04086-B_006755-007712 and the doors didn't close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and you're thinking [laughter-to] [laughter-yourself] if it's not right now [laughter-what] [laughter-is] [laughter-it] [laughter-gonna] be like after i've had it for six [laughter-months]
sw04086-B_007712-007945 [noise] so
sw04086-B_008306-008451 yeah

sw04086-B_012934-013199 well um
sw04086-B_013199-013695 i know i['ve]- i've always looked for mileage
sw04086-B_013695-014770 uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job it's doing burning stuff up
sw04086-B_014770-014905 uh
sw04086-B_015799-016539 yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving
sw04086-B_017138-017499  go away from here 
sw04086-B_017499-017929 just a minute

sw04086-B_027142-027299 yeah it i[t]-
sw04086-B_027799-028648 well it's not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open
sw04086-B_028648-029377 so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean that's a nuisance that's a real pain
sw04086-B_029377-029952 yeah um and one of them_1 only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other
sw04087-A_000000-000160 [noise] well do you have children
sw04087-A_000160-000335 you don't have children
sw04087-A_000335-000702 and my children are in their twenties now so
sw04087-A_000702-001332 child care is something that i- i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard
sw04087-A_001332-001674 at the time just finding finding sitters i
sw04087-A_001674-001991 did not work though so i didn't have to uh
sw04087-A_001991-002254 have to worry about you know
sw04087-A_002254-002602 all day during the day which i think is a real problem
sw04087-A_005503-005652 uh-huh
sw04087-A_006924-007093 oh boy
sw04087-A_007739-008226 no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it
sw04087-A_008226-008566 instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know
sw04087-A_008566-008911 that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money
sw04087-A_008911-009435 and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing
sw04087-A_009435-009991 and you we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and
sw04087-A_009991-010415 people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening
sw04087-A_010415-011083 and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do
sw04087-A_011426-011561 yeah
sw04087-A_012219-012435 do you know how much it is
sw04087-A_012435-012607 yeah
sw04087-A_012607-013190 yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know
sw04087-A_013190-013772 a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help
sw04087-A_014198-014437 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04087-A_014437-015075 yeah [noise] that's right well i- i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if
sw04087-A_015075-015468 what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be
sw04087-A_015468-015840 a good place and uh do they
sw04087-A_015840-016502 do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know
sw04087-A_017405-017547 uh-huh
sw04087-A_017547-017828 y[ou]- you haven't decided yet huh
sw04087-A_017828-018296 no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and
sw04087-A_018296-018891 there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't [vocalized-noise]
sw04087-A_018891-019407 didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh
sw04087-A_019407-019722 it felt good to be there when they got home from school
sw04087-A_019722-019941 um those were the stories that
sw04087-A_019941-020407 that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to
sw04087-A_020407-020766 get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then
sw04087-A_020766-021417 later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing
sw04087-A_021417-021947 oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera
sw04087-A_021947-022454 but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career
sw04087-A_022454-023054 you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a a real question
sw04087-A_023252-023585 and uh do you know uh
sw04087-A_023585-024061 you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both
sw04087-A_024334-024478 uh-huh
sw04087-A_024834-024984 uh-huh
sw04087-A_025378-026013 well what about you and your own background di[d]- did your mother or father stay home or di[d]- did they work or
sw04087-A_026844-027139 and so you so you were in school
sw04087-A_027139-027662 and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened
sw04087-A_027662-028258 i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or
sw04087-A_028258-028396 do you remember
sw04087-A_029292-029721 so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah
sw04087-A_029721-030007 yeah cause i think that's another
sw04087-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04087-B_000050-000253 no
sw04087-B_000253-000403 no
sw04087-B_000602-000743 oh
sw04087-B_002524-002672 yeah
sw04087-B_002672-002775 [noise]
sw04087-B_002775-002990 yeah i agree uh
sw04087-B_002990-003454 cause [noise] i suppose when when i do start having children uh
sw04087-B_003560-003847 i'd like to stay home for a while but uh
sw04087-B_003847-004214 you know eventually i'd i might have to put them in day care to work
sw04087-B_004214-004908 and i think it's hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in Milwaukee um
sw04087-B_004908-005222 they're closing down a day care because um
sw04087-B_005222-005571 th[e]- the lady who owns it um slapped a child
sw04087-B_005571-005859 and um she had a lot of um
sw04087-B_005959-006066 like um
sw04087-B_006169-006384 um what did she have um like
sw04087-B_006384-007056 tickets against her um saying that the she didn't have proper food um prepared for them
sw04087-B_007056-007272 and that it was just dirty and
sw04087-B_007272-007827 and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that
sw04087-B_008517-008649 right
sw04087-B_009393-009515 right
sw04087-B_009886-010052 um-hum
sw04087-B_010338-010551 um-hum yeah
sw04087-B_011039-011270 right or you have to um
sw04087-B_011270-011526 it's pretty expensive [laughter] i
sw04087-B_011526-011830 the college i go to they have uh child care
sw04087-B_011830-012101 um there but you still have to pay
sw04087-B_012101-012372 you know it doesn't come with them
sw04087-B_012372-012573 no i don't
sw04087-B_013173-013267 [laughter]
sw04087-B_013759-014295 right it's like uh uh if you do work [laughter] most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so
sw04087-B_014295-014548 you might as well stay home if you're married [laughter]
sw04087-B_015587-015724 right
sw04087-B_016427-016841 yeah i've i've heard a lot of things about that too um
sw04087-B_016841-017279 with some people say [noise] it's not healthy for your children to be in day care
sw04087-B_017279-017687 and you know other's say it is so i don't know [laughter]
sw04087-B_017687-017947 [laughter-no]
sw04087-B_019655-019820 yeah
sw04087-B_021156-021305 yeah
sw04087-B_021305-021431 [laughter]
sw04087-B_021431-021549 yeah
sw04087-B_021892-022029 um-hum
sw04087-B_022982-023278 yeah that is it's a tough decision
sw04087-B_023830-023981 um-hum
sw04087-B_023981-024217 um [noise] i think it's
sw04087-B_024217-024357 f[or]- for the students
sw04087-B_024462-024900 yeah i don't know if it wou[ld]- it's it makes sense to have it for the teachers too
sw04087-B_024900-025051 but um
sw04087-B_025051-025440 i'm not really sure [laughter-i] [laughter-haven't] looked into [laughter] i don't need it [laughter]
sw04087-B_025943-026331 um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and
sw04087-B_026331-026963 she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after
sw04087-B_027076-027198 right
sw04087-B_028173-028297 um
sw04087-B_028297-028543 [noise] for a while she was there
sw04087-B_028543-029357 um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so
sw04087-B_029493-029823 yeah um-hum yeah there was already somebody home
sw04088-A_000000-001049 [noise] okay well uh i guess since i called i'll start out with my feelings about it uh i think that it's absolutely essential that some so[me]- at least some employees
sw04088-A_001049-002267 of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like
sw04088-A_002267-003220 uh for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it uh i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling
sw04088-A_008232-008408 uh-huh
sw04088-A_008408-008554 yeah
sw04088-A_010192-010651 right [laughter] or Northwest i think Northwest has had a lot of problems with that
sw04088-A_010651-011547 i uh i've been in uh two two situations where i've had to under go [grug/drug] test[ing]- drug testing i was in the military for a number of years
sw04088-A_011547-012078 and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh
sw04088-A_012078-013027 in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs
sw04088-A_013027-014217 and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it
sw04088-A_014217-014911 i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd
sw04088-A_016043-016186 um-hum
sw04088-A_016679-016818 um-hum
sw04088-A_017044-017175 uh-huh
sw04088-A_018147-018281 uh-huh
sw04088-A_018424-018544 right
sw04088-A_019451-019548 um
sw04088-A_019548-019688 um-hum
sw04088-A_020607-020729 uh-huh
sw04088-A_020831-020953 right
sw04088-A_021738-022211 right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time
sw04088-A_022553-022687 uh-huh
sw04088-A_022949-023072 uh-huh
sw04088-A_023174-023288 uh-huh
sw04088-A_023930-024061 uh-huh
sw04088-A_025121-025866 um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's wh[y]-
sw04088-A_025866-026145 that's probably why they justified it
sw04088-A_026517-026871 no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you
sw04088-A_027109-027239 right
sw04088-A_027516-027643 right
sw04088-A_027901-028513 yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else
sw04088-A_028513-029354 uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you
sw04088-A_029354-029863 uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh
sw04088-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04088-B_001547-001685 um-hum
sw04088-B_003181-004366 well uh i[t]- i[t]- it it becomes sort of a a topic where i sit there and and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a a reaction after i think about it a little longer uh
sw04088-B_004366-005389 for me i i guess i feel like uh we have w[e]- w[e]- that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a
sw04088-B_005389-005886 a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated
sw04088-B_005886-006724 uh i think you're right about uh certain jobs and uh certainly something like uh a bus train pilots
sw04088-B_006724-007777 uh it's obviously something that's a necessity it because_1 it because_1 the function of the job is is within all e[veryone]- pretty much everyone in the world
sw04088-B_007777-008312 uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities
sw04088-B_008312-008455 okay
sw04088-B_008455-008858 and like so i guess in some ways i'm agreeing with you
sw04088-B_008858-009819 uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an Eastern pilot to
sw04088-B_009819-010266 uh have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly
sw04088-B_010580-010703 right
sw04088-B_010885-010999 [noise]
sw04088-B_011484-011628 um-hum
sw04088-B_013747-013899 [noise]
sw04088-B_014867-015552 i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry
sw04088-B_015552-016107 uh something wh[ere]- wh[ere]- see you're talking about a plant where okay if you're a nuclear inspector
sw04088-B_016107-017082 or where you're a uh person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense
sw04088-B_017082-018479 but uh we're talking about y[ou]- you know you're saying well uh and i think you uh that you just stated the same thing that if you were a cler[ical]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now where's the justification
sw04088-B_018479-019263 wh[at]- wh[at]- what okay you know [laughter] let's say that we can y[ou]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you had had a uh uh you went to a party and
sw04088-B_019263-020022 uh not not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot uh now how is that going to make any difference
sw04088-B_020022-020678 you know unless you ve[ry]- unless you uh uh PCP does exist apparently in the blood stream
sw04088-B_020678-021268 for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be
sw04088-B_021268-021807 uh very it it's very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you
sw04088-B_021947-022117 right
sw04088-B_022117-022590 [laughter] so bu[t]- i I just went through one recently
sw04088-B_022590-023414 and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the
sw04088-B_023557-024138 there's really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean uh
sw04088-B_024138-024405 it's a company that
sw04088-B_024405-024726 it's basically a oh
sw04088-B_024901-025205 management engineering company
sw04088-B_025205-025383 now
sw04088-B_025698-026334 w[hat]- wait but then but then uh but then if the if you're saying that [laughter]
sw04088-B_026334-026472 uh
sw04088-B_026472-026637 [laughter]
sw04088-B_026637-027977 they should also regu[late]- right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also regu[late]- see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend
sw04088-B_028487-028608 right
sw04088-B_029799-029863 um-hum
sw04089-A_000000-000224 [noise] how's the quality of air in Portland
sw04089-A_000224-000362 really
sw04089-A_001154-001281 um-hum
sw04089-A_001650-001954 um-hum probably a lot of ozone lot of smog
sw04089-A_002056-002189 yeah it
sw04089-A_002305-002712 oh yeah i've heard that Los Angeles is horrible and Denver is [vocalized-noise] i hear is really bad
sw04089-A_002712-003342 Atlanta's Atlanta's moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um
sw04089-A_003342-004252 and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air
sw04089-A_004252-004429 um
sw04089-A_004429-004869 i think a lot i think m[ost]- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions
sw04089-A_004869-005149 because_1 you know it's a very you know mobile city
sw04089-A_005488-005600 um-hum

sw04089-A_006568-006661 um-hum
sw04089-A_006661-007119 of heavy industry yeah i think i think the [vocalized-noise] has been you know relatively good about
sw04089-A_007119-007597 um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about
sw04089-A_007597-009038 in[dustry]- industry pollution but it just seems that i th[ink]- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country
sw04089-A_009038-010098 um it seems it seems like like there's a l[ot]- you know there's a l[ot]- there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know f[or]- through through the c[onstruction]- through the construction of highways for automobiles
sw04089-A_010098-010199 yeah
sw04089-A_010812-010932 hm

sw04089-A_021415-021894 um they they do have automo[bile]- automobile emissions tests but um
sw04089-A_021894-023054 it's there there's some sort of rule i don't have a car so i don't know the actual specifics but it's like if you[r]- your car is if the ma[ke]- if the m[odel]- model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you don't have to have it inspected any more
sw04089-A_023054-023517 you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that you'd expect to
sw04089-A_023517-023789 you know be the hardest be the m[ost]- biggest polluters
sw04089-A_024188-024350 yeah true
sw04089-A_025950-026205 [laughter]
sw04089-A_027254-027478 i basically live downtown
sw04089-A_027478-028139 and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or within a mile from the heart of downtown
sw04089-A_028385-029100 it's i don't think it's really announced you know in the sense that the way i[t]- the way it is in California but um
sw04089-A_029100-029952 i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently there's some federal guidelines for um smog and Atlanta's like it
sw04089-B_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04089-B_000147-000309 very good
sw04089-B_000309-001240 uh well let me put it this way it's it's relatively uh it's very good i[f]- if you are a little bit away from the city and it's and it's wonderful on days that it rains
sw04089-B_001240-001830 but uh downtown they have a few problems but it's
sw04089-B_001930-002398 but it's fairly localized it's not like uh Los Angeles where i used to live
sw04089-B_002652-002821 ye[s]- yes uh
sw04089-B_005154-005801 it i guess that's the the major problem with most cities except except places like uh
sw04089-B_005801-006723 oh Mexico City or some place like that well i guess it's it's a problem there too but but they do have some places where that's caused by power plants and and stuff like that
sw04089-B_009905-010044 yeah
sw04089-B_010044-010603 although [vocalized-noise] there is one thing that i uh i learned in in
sw04089-B_010603-011195 chemistry many years ago and that's uh i don't know are are you a chemist
sw04089-B_011299-011758 okay anyway this is principle called Le Chatelier's principal as i remember and it's
sw04089-B_011758-011962 basically uh
sw04089-B_011962-012121 uh when you have uh
sw04089-B_012121-013486 a reaction and it it uh [noise] the reaction will go until it un[til]- until it kind of comes to a balance but if you take away some of the products of that reaction then the reaction will go farther
sw04089-B_013486-014186 and so uh the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out was he said he said in a in a desirable area
sw04089-B_014186-015022 people will move in until until bad things happen that cause the uh desirabilities to go to
sw04089-B_015022-015546 you know to uh ba[lance]- kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be
sw04089-B_015546-016687 it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what i'm looking at here in the Portland area is is a temporary situation it's a very desirable area as far as i'm concerned and uh
sw04089-B_016687-017553 the wonderful air the lack of of uh congestion the low low cost of of uh property uh
sw04089-B_017553-018387 in a few years something's going to cause i mean there's uh people just going to continue to move in until we either
sw04089-B_018554-018678 and a[nd]-
sw04089-B_018678-018949 and as many people move in as move out
sw04089-B_018949-020224 and it'll come to a balance and then if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion then air pollution will get bad or something else and that's happened in California that's for sure
sw04089-B_020224-021449 uh as far as in Atlanta do they have a uh do they have uh regulations on on uh like inspection
sw04089-B_023006-023201 yeah the grandfather type thing
sw04089-B_023510-023628 yeah
sw04089-B_023789-024328 although i think that's partly because it's harder to get parts and and uh
sw04089-B_024328-024713 so let's see what was my other question uh
sw04089-B_024841-025575 [laughter] my wife thinks this is uh a uh sales call so she's telling me to talk to you about
sw04089-B_025575-026062 one of the problems with uh she thinks it's fr[om]- from uh our cable company
sw04089-B_026199-026516 uh let's see what else we have uh
sw04089-B_026813-027003 let's see do you live
sw04089-B_027003-027399 you don't live too clo[se]- do you live close to the city or far away from it
sw04089-B_027399-027568 okay downtown
sw04089-B_028130-028265 do they have smog days there
sw04089-B_028265-028407 uh
sw04090-A_000000-000231 [noise] okay Eric um
sw04090-A_000231-000518 are you married and do you have a family
sw04090-A_000755-001442 okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
sw04090-A_002319-002469 uh-huh
sw04090-A_003144-003326 [noise]
sw04090-A_004311-004447 uh-huh
sw04090-A_004661-004822 okay
sw04090-A_004822-004949 um
sw04090-A_004949-005107 [noise]
sw04090-A_005107-005795 [noise] well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so
sw04090-A_005795-006597 we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
sw04090-A_006597-006965 and then we divvy them up between
sw04090-A_006965-008211 our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
sw04090-A_008211-008586 and so that does help that helps a lot
sw04090-A_008586-009432 and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra]- extra for extra spending so it's pretty well [laughter] earmarked
sw04090-A_009432-010286 yeah [laughter] ev[ery]- every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
sw04090-A_010286-010832 and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
sw04090-A_010832-011841 found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all
sw04090-A_011841-012640 um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
sw04090-A_012791-012957 [noise]
sw04090-A_013520-013735 that's true
sw04090-A_014847-015018 uh-huh
sw04090-A_015018-015255 [laughter]
sw04090-A_016062-016229 yeah
sw04090-A_016396-016624 well it helps you to focus
sw04090-A_016624-017341 where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s[ame]- the same frustration before you got on a budget but
sw04090-A_017341-018394 you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
sw04090-A_018394-018898 huh and also we have found that if we write down
sw04090-A_018898-019809 a[nd]- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
sw04090-A_019809-019959 every paycheck
sw04090-A_019959-020474 and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
sw04090-A_020474-021105 [noise] just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's
sw04090-A_021105-021366 we should because_1 it does help
sw04090-A_022001-022154 uh-huh
sw04090-A_022154-022259 [laughter]
sw04090-A_023201-023370 uh-huh
sw04090-A_023370-023546 [noise]
sw04090-A_024000-024127 [vocalized-noise]
sw04090-A_024127-024526 just stick to that uh-huh that is
sw04090-A_024526-024751 [laughter-uh-huh]
sw04090-A_024751-024938 yeah
sw04090-A_024938-025036 that
sw04090-A_025036-025300 that sounds like a really good idea
sw04090-A_025300-025518 and it really helpful
sw04090-A_025518-026219 um have you [noise] developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet
sw04090-A_027073-027231 oh uh-huh
sw04090-A_027231-027386 uh-huh
sw04090-A_027917-028314 oh that's good that's a good feeling [noise]
sw04090-A_028314-028840 my husband just graduated from the university uh [noise]
sw04090-A_028840-029671 a year ago so finally [laughter] finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or
sw04090-B_000000-000057 [noise]
sw04090-B_000464-000850 [noise] uh yes i am to uh both questions
sw04090-B_001396-001690 uh yeah we do we um [noise]
sw04090-B_001690-002180 uh basically there's the you know expenses that
sw04090-B_002180-002748 are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and
sw04090-B_002748-003220 we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet
sw04090-B_003220-004076 [noise] and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what
sw04090-B_004076-004370 you know what sort of range we're gonna
sw04090-B_004474-004748 generally gonna shoot for
sw04090-B_004960-005162 [noise] so what do you do
sw04090-B_006540-006675 um-hum
sw04090-B_007211-007413 [laughter-wow]
sw04090-B_008211-008347 yeah
sw04090-B_009053-009682 [laughter-yeah] all allocated out [laughter] yeah
sw04090-B_011786-011913 all the
sw04090-B_011913-012109 checks yeah
sw04090-B_012586-012900 right yeah we found that um
sw04090-B_012900-013368 it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of
sw04090-B_013368-014369 the unnecessary expenses [laughter] we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh
sw04090-B_014369-014620 money for things that
sw04090-B_014620-015678 you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh
sw04090-B_015678-016153 thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
sw04090-B_016153-016463 because of this and and stuff like that so
sw04090-B_016782-016976 yeah [laughter]
sw04090-B_017952-018292 that's a lot of money but [laughter]
sw04090-B_018292-018468 yeah
sw04090-B_018468-018576 [vocalized-noise]
sw04090-B_019903-020033 um-hum
sw04090-B_021082-021200 [noise]
sw04090-B_021302-021782 yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if
sw04090-B_021782-022682 you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to [laughter-uh] uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
sw04090-B_022682-023522 um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a
sw04090-B_023522-024248 in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount
sw04090-B_024357-025145 and then once that was gone well [laughter] if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone [laughter]
sw04090-B_025256-025443 so
sw04090-B_026132-027277 we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
sw04090-B_027277-028046 uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so
sw04090-B_028046-028171 [noise]
sw04090-B_028171-028401 yeah i
sw04090-B_028911-029055 um-hum
sw04090-B_029055-029197 [laughter]
sw04090-B_029197-029398 a study
sw04090-B_029398-029501 yeah
sw04090-B_029601-029847 yeah i'm actually in the in the mas[ter]-
sw04091-A_000000-000234 [noise] i guess that starts it um
sw04091-A_000234-000937 so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program
sw04091-A_000937-001393 uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return
sw04091-A_001393-001727 this time around on my uh investment
sw04091-A_001727-002073 which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house
sw04091-A_002219-002550 yeah what they do i[s]- what they do is it's it's a purchase program
sw04091-A_002550-003324 where you get the stock i[t's]- i[t's]- it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year
sw04091-A_003324-003771 so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share
sw04091-A_003771-004022 stocks trading about fourteen now
sw04091-A_004022-004413 so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty f[our]- four and turn around the same day
sw04091-A_004413-005239 the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do
sw04091-A_005500-005635 yeah
sw04091-A_005635-005826 that's with Interleaf
sw04091-A_005826-006014 Interleaf
sw04091-A_006014-006224 uh desktop publishing
sw04091-A_006328-006416 so
sw04091-A_006523-006700 but um you know
sw04091-A_006928-007172 yeah benefits other than salary
sw04091-A_007451-007606 [noise] um-hum
sw04091-A_007903-008346 yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have [vocalized-noise] especially these days
sw04091-A_009290-009412 right
sw04091-A_009793-010294 what is what is that like a uh like a [noise] uh [vocalized-noise] TIACREF type thing
sw04091-A_010421-010768 okay yeah [vocalized-noise] so it's for retirement
sw04091-A_010768-011083 yeah so you you have to wait until like [vocalized-noise] fifty five or
sw04091-A_011913-012088 right
sw04091-A_012088-012417 yeah we we we've got a 401K here
sw04091-A_012417-013505 but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K
sw04091-A_013505-014198 but you know i'd much [laughter-rather] get the eight[een]- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house
sw04091-A_014309-015040 but yeah you know me[dical]- medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month
sw04091-A_015040-015676 [noise] it's like your yeah it is it's a very good company as far as benefits go they've got 401K's they've got uh
sw04091-A_015676-016863 the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125K selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the d[ental]- you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing
sw04091-A_016863-017494 um and you know you the 125K means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax
sw04091-A_017595-018797 the only problem with 125K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away
sw04091-A_019078-019697 so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears
sw04091-A_019697-020809 but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and misce[llaneous]- miscellaneous medical and deductibles
sw04091-A_020809-021811 so i just have them_1 pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because_1 it's on pre tax
sw04091-A_022192-022328 yeah i'm here
sw04091-A_022479-022637 yeah
sw04091-A_022637-022798 yeah
sw04091-A_023902-025087 yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know [noise] hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um
sw04091-A_025087-025410 i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree
sw04091-A_025410-025872 because_1 then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything
sw04091-A_026393-026532 right
sw04091-A_026913-027025 um-hum
sw04091-A_027153-027289 um-hum
sw04091-A_027289-027425 um-hum
sw04091-A_028775-029795 yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did
sw04091-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04091-B_000139-000266 all right go
sw04091-B_001687-001801 good
sw04091-B_002016-002345 is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for
sw04091-B_003734-003842 right
sw04091-B_003969-004139 wow [noise]
sw04091-B_005291-005543 yeah yeah that sounds good
sw04091-B_005543-005742 what company is that
sw04091-B_005742-005916 excuse me
sw04091-B_005916-006101 Interleaf never heard of it
sw04091-B_006201-006347 oh okay
sw04091-B_006583-007087 yeah what are we supposed to talk a[bout]- sa[laries]- [noise] benefits besides salary is that [vocalized-noise]
sw04091-B_007087-007537 yeah but i- i get a i get a pretty good i work for the City of New York
sw04091-B_007537-007892 and i get a pretty good um health plan
sw04091-B_007892-008041 and
sw04091-B_008294-009437 yeah the health plan's pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it
sw04091-B_009437-009878 and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees
sw04091-B_010268-010691 it's like a 401K plan except they don't they don't contribute
sw04091-B_010691-010825 right
sw04091-B_011078-012292 yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that
sw04091-B_014162-014349 yeah uh
sw04091-B_014991-015200 wow that's that's really good
sw04091-B_016815-016943 right
sw04091-B_018893-019157 if you own oh okay i see
sw04091-B_020056-020179 right
sw04091-B_022107-022230 hello
sw04091-B_022230-023253 yeah it uh it was a width away that's why it's it's every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah there's there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's there's uh
sw04091-B_023253-024099 there's benefits just in working for a big organization i think in in that you have a lot of uh different people doing a lot of different things and
sw04091-B_024499-024661 okay
sw04091-B_025776-026612 right well that's working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and and just that
sw04091-B_026612-027496 um but what i mean is i- i say for instance i'm an attorney uh a collection attorney for the City of New York and and in the environmental control board and
sw04091-B_027496-028848 i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff

sw04093-A_000328-000820 yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry
sw04093-A_000820-001570 and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't
sw04093-A_001570-002182 i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in
sw04093-A_002182-003094 and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices consi[dered]-
sw04093-A_003094-003688 i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um
sw04093-A_003688-004293 nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time
sw04093-A_004753-005337 i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh
sw04093-A_005337-005921 if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that
sw04093-A_005921-006409 but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh
sw04093-A_006409-007041 uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle
sw04093-A_007041-007454 [laughter] you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society
sw04093-A_007454-007523 [vocalized-noise]
sw04093-A_007735-009086 and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually ma[ke]- let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even
sw04093-A_009086-009308 like not even on drugs
sw04093-A_009557-009674 right

sw04093-A_010628-011450 and oh it was on in 60 Minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a B fifty two bomber pilot
sw04093-A_011450-011955 and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he
sw04093-A_011955-013211 he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh
sw04093-A_013211-013457 you know i guess it's called exonerated
sw04093-A_013457-013810 but by then his career is was was ruined because
sw04093-A_013810-013898 yeah
sw04093-A_013898-014333 he's he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident
sw04093-A_014333-014468 and
sw04093-A_014468-014676 [noise]
sw04093-A_014676-014765 uh-huh
sw04093-A_015553-015685 yeah
sw04093-A_015685-016301 oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors
sw04093-A_016301-016583 uh [laughter] which you think of the
sw04093-A_016583-017363 well no i'm talking about like the guy no i'm i'm talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though [vocalized-noise]

sw04093-A_025302-025390 yeah
sw04093-A_025390-025897 by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know
sw04093-A_025897-026355 i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random
sw04093-A_026355-027274 law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on
sw04093-A_027274-028643 [laughter] you know and [laughter] and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about [vocalized-noise] what should we be should we have legalized drugs
sw04093-A_028643-028767 you know
sw04093-A_028767-028913 [noise]
sw04093-A_029763-029968 yeah i i think that uh
sw04093-B_000000-000103 so uh
sw04093-B_000103-000401 does your company do any sort of drug testing
sw04093-B_000757-000871 uh-huh
sw04093-B_002133-002246 uh-huh
sw04093-B_003015-003125 uh-huh
sw04093-B_004072-004231 um-hum

sw04093-B_011861-012002 right
sw04093-B_013372-013518 i guess so right
sw04093-B_013693-013918 oh yes his life is over at that point
sw04093-B_014313-014691 yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives
sw04093-B_014691-015197 to the number of false positives and you know the number of people you're going to hurt
sw04093-B_015197-015622 while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high
sw04093-B_016256-016356 uh-huh
sw04093-B_016473-016655 you [vocalized-noise] like the ticket takers
sw04093-B_016856-016980 [vocalized-noise] engineer
sw04093-B_016980-017080 [laughter]
sw04093-B_017292-017868 it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for
sw04093-B_017969-018652 you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball
sw04093-B_018652-019076 and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing
sw04093-B_019076-019485 not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something
sw04093-B_019485-020153 that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before
sw04093-B_020153-020640 and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's
sw04093-B_020640-020949 you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick
sw04093-B_020949-021124 or uh
sw04093-B_021124-021809 you know uh using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck
sw04093-B_021809-022236 and and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test
sw04093-B_023182-024043 well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test
sw04093-B_024043-024178 uh
sw04093-B_024178-024934 the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job
sw04093-B_024934-025364 uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle
sw04093-B_025364-025487 uh
sw04093-B_025746-025950 um-hum
sw04093-B_027195-027372 [laughter]
sw04093-B_028651-028899 well a lot of people say that that would
sw04093-B_028899-029338 simplify a lot of things uh i tend to
sw04093-B_029338-029824 i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops
sw04094-A_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04094-A_000028-000655 uh uh uh capital punishment i understand means if somebody commits a serious enough crime we kill them
sw04094-A_000655-000899 is that your understanding of it
sw04094-A_000899-001755 well let me put it bluntly [vocalized-noise] there's not too many things that Arabs do right but one of the things they do is have a low crime rates they don't have too many repeat offenders
sw04094-A_001755-002153 and they have uh very serious capital punishment over there

sw04094-A_006286-006827 death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess
sw04094-A_007560-007787 yeah and then get out in what [laughter]
sw04094-A_008064-008152 um

sw04094-A_010705-011427 and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out
sw04094-A_011538-011670 [noise]
sw04094-A_012761-012869 um-hum
sw04094-A_013115-013452 what would you think about public executions

sw04094-A_015519-015647 hm
sw04094-A_015877-015975 uh
sw04094-A_015975-017299 [noise] if if it's death let's get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite qui[ckly]- quite quickly they had this guy on the [vocalized-noise] news that's been around since seventy six and he's cost us over four million dollars so far
sw04094-A_017299-018673 uh let's speed it up be sure it's as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldn't be out you shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days
sw04094-A_018673-018933 uh tha[t]- maybe off the subject but uh
sw04094-A_018933-019216 [vocalized-noise]
sw04094-A_019216-019349 oh yeah
sw04094-A_020058-020201 um-hum

sw04094-A_020961-021499 no yeah start at the bottom start pushing the ones on the street corner they'll run out of supplies
sw04094-A_021499-021826 i'm i'm cruel on that drugs have no place at all
sw04094-A_021826-021939 um
sw04094-A_022267-022421 um-hum
sw04094-A_023665-023856 right
sw04094-A_024067-024245 fairly quickly
sw04094-A_024245-024865 fairly quickly i don't have uh you know [vocalized-noise] we're in so much agreement i guess i'm try to play the devil's advocate
sw04094-A_024865-025008 uh
sw04094-A_025008-025691 as a Christian i can't even be the devil's adv[ocate]- i'm a Christian and i still think there's an appropriate place for it
sw04094-A_025691-025827 uh
sw04094-A_027108-027362 um um-hum
sw04094-A_027362-028253 yeah i can go along with that i just wish we could get [vocalized-noise] get uh debate going here [laughter-to] [laughter-get] [laughter-some] verbal usage for the [laughter-computer] uh
sw04094-A_028253-029034 i have a brother-in-law that is strictly opposed to it and uh he is a uh very liberal uh
sw04094-A_029034-029952 believer in uh probation uh and convicts not being sent to prison but being sent to uh halfway houses
sw04094-B_000000-000053 [noise] yeah
sw04094-B_000614-000789 that's correct
sw04094-B_000789-000971 right uh-huh
sw04094-B_001720-001850 [laughter-right]
sw04094-B_002155-002495 yes i i really think that um
sw04094-B_002495-002707 there is room for that
sw04094-B_002707-004004 i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and they're sentenced to life in prison then it's not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out
sw04094-B_004004-004364 i believe that if they're convicted and it's um
sw04094-B_004467-005167 you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence
sw04094-B_005167-005411 to close the case do you know what i mean
sw04094-B_005661-005785 right
sw04094-B_006750-007617 well i don't think it's too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other
sw04094-B_007719-008424 right and um then they're repeat offenders um i went to school with one of Ted Bundy's attacked girls
sw04094-B_008424-009669 she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point
sw04094-B_009669-010080 and i think he killed her definitely uh-hum
sw04094-B_011367-012057 right um i think that in my belief i bel[ieve]- we uh i believe that if a person has killed
sw04094-B_012057-013200 then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can
sw04094-B_013432-014638 i definitely no i don't think so i don't think that that's something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i don't agree with that and i don't even think that they need to
sw04094-B_014638-015500 have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be
sw04094-B_015500-015870 but i don't believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think
sw04094-B_017184-017309 right
sw04094-B_018885-019492 oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs
sw04094-B_019492-020458 if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives
sw04094-B_020613-021165 because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if i'm caught so what's the big deal
sw04094-B_021498-021600 yep
sw04094-B_021750-021851 no
sw04094-B_021851-021989 and um
sw04094-B_021989-022416 so i- i- i think that it could go even farther than
sw04094-B_022551-023371 i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change
sw04094-B_023371-024213 but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they re[peat]- repeat these offenses
sw04094-B_024213-024350 so
sw04094-B_024749-024986 [laughter]
sw04094-B_024986-025101 yeah
sw04094-B_025407-025541 that's
sw04094-B_025641-026625 yeah i'm i'm a Christian also and that's why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a person's committed murder that's an unpardonable sin
sw04094-B_026625-027438 and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our Lo[rd]- uh God is pardoning do you know what i mean
sw04094-B_027798-028200 [laughter]
sw04095-A_000000-000165 [noise] kids

sw04095-B_029363-029562 i bet
sw04096-A_000000-000149 [noise] hello Ann
sw04096-A_000285-000539 um the other day
sw04096-A_000539-001024 i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling
sw04096-A_001024-001242 and uh
sw04096-A_001242-001897 i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places
sw04096-A_001897-002107 and uh
sw04096-A_002107-002289 they
sw04096-A_002289-003008 had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
sw04096-A_003399-003679 [laughter] well it's not too new
sw04096-A_004197-004330 oh
sw04096-A_004457-004924 they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were
sw04096-A_004924-005415 the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA
sw04096-A_005415-005847 but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and
sw04096-A_005847-006375 things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and
sw04096-A_006375-006553 and uh
sw04096-A_006553-007371 uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um
sw04096-A_007473-007982 the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print
sw04096-A_007982-009081 and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into [noise] recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
sw04096-A_011310-011990 yeah we're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here there's uh
sw04096-A_011990-012350 we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a
sw04096-A_012350-012788 couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper
sw04096-A_012788-013283 and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not
sw04096-A_013283-013683 a fire hazard and make it into insulation
sw04096-A_013683-014541 and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
sw04096-A_014649-015268 so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to
sw04096-A_015368-015831 get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it
sw04096-A_018309-018443 um-hum
sw04096-A_019934-020469 and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama
sw04096-A_020469-021267 and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was
sw04096-A_021267-021798 oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was
sw04096-A_021798-022591 how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill
sw04096-A_022591-023024 and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics
sw04096-A_023024-023522 and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1
sw04096-A_023522-024083 he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's
sw04096-A_024083-024510 it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
sw04096-A_024510-025559 and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity
sw04096-A_025559-025950 so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
sw04096-A_026346-027066 yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever
sw04096-A_027066-028144 well that was [laughter] he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it
sw04096-A_028628-028832 yeah well real interest[ing]-
sw04096-A_028943-029081 [noise] um
sw04096-A_029189-029407 not too much i'm
sw04096-A_029654-029831 uh i got a bit actuall[y]-
sw04096-B_000000-000296 [noise] hello Chuck
sw04096-B_000991-001133 um-hum
sw04096-B_001802-001944 um-hum
sw04096-B_003072-003471 um i didn't think that was a new revelation
sw04096-B_003606-003806 right
sw04096-B_003806-004238 so what what i[s]- is the EPA recommending now
sw04096-B_005345-005494 um-hum
sw04096-B_007923-008052 yeah
sw04096-B_009043-009944 why that's a that's a common problem now that seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York [noise]
sw04096-B_009944-010816 and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore
sw04096-B_010816-011299 which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose
sw04096-B_011809-011950 um-hum
sw04096-B_013399-013536 right
sw04096-B_014509-014704 well that's good
sw04096-B_015749-016304 right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle
sw04096-B_016304-017234 the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that [noise] uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers
sw04096-B_017234-018572 uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh
sw04096-B_018572-019293 i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled
sw04096-B_019293-019957 [noise] like the recycled plastic Coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that
sw04096-B_022535-022679 um-hum
sw04096-B_023452-023600 [noise] oh really
sw04096-B_024417-024587 right
sw04096-B_025560-025700 huh
sw04096-B_025903-026540 well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but [noise] what
sw04096-B_026908-027127 what about emissions
sw04096-B_027334-027483 oh
sw04096-B_027586-027741 [laughter-okay]
sw04096-B_028012-028643 no well that's interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then
sw04096-B_028643-028940 did it change anything for you
sw04097-A_000000-000059 [noise]
sw04097-A_000919-001031 um-hum
sw04097-A_001159-001486 does he he live at home now and
sw04097-A_002191-002377 um-hum yeah
sw04097-A_003450-004860 no i i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady she's uh she's really pretty good but but she really just can't get around any more and she does have signi[ficant]- significant health problems
sw04097-A_004860-005862 and my mom is looking after after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out
sw04097-A_005862-006365 uh and uh it's tough on on my grandmother because she's use to just
sw04097-A_006365-007788 going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing
sw04097-A_007788-008694 fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah
sw04097-A_008694-009500 yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little bit more objective but
sw04097-A_009500-010094 i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy
sw04097-A_010244-010403 yeah
sw04097-A_010403-010549 yeah
sw04097-A_012496-012640 um
sw04097-A_013905-013995 yeah
sw04097-A_014881-016092 you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums
sw04097-A_016092-016672 where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence
sw04097-A_016672-017807 but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile
sw04097-A_017807-018212 the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost
sw04097-A_018332-019537 uh i mean that's that's almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but it's it's
sw04097-A_019537-020037 [vocalized-noise] you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets
sw04097-A_020037-020883 so they want to really make a a a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she'd be happier
sw04097-A_020883-021842 uh and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating
sw04097-A_021842-022896 and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you
sw04097-A_023352-023486 oh
sw04097-A_024038-024261 um-hum yeah
sw04097-A_024898-025541 oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or ha[ve]-
sw04097-A_025862-025995 oh
sw04097-A_025995-026167 oh yeah
sw04097-A_026453-026616 oh
sw04097-A_026616-027536 yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and there's [noise] the[re]- there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of of house mates
sw04097-A_027536-028106 somebody that comes and lives there and for the room and board takes care of people but
sw04097-A_028106-028640 you need you need a contact service in the community i'd i'd even be happy just
sw04097-A_028640-029808 uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting so[me]- right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she
sw04097-B_000000-000663 uh no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father
sw04097-B_000663-000986 and it is a tough decision to make [laughter]
sw04097-B_000986-001149 that uh
sw04097-B_001353-002259 yes and he's living at home [noise] more or less alone my sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden on her
sw04097-B_002259-002966 and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do
sw04097-B_002966-003476 and of course he feels like he is capable of taking care of himself and we know better [laughter]
sw04097-B_003871-003983 uh-huh
sw04097-B_004132-004282 [laughter]
sw04097-B_004771-004884 uh-huh
sw04097-B_005808-005918 yeah
sw04097-B_007234-007386 uh-huh
sw04097-B_008346-008466 [laughter]
sw04097-B_008578-008758 oh yeah Yeah
sw04097-B_010078-010905 well that's that will be a problem because i have looked [laughter] and they all really amount to the same thing uh
sw04097-B_010905-011886 i've looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of State run things to the very private elite type and it really
sw04097-B_011886-012575 boils down i think to one thing you're putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die
sw04097-B_012575-013186 and it's uh it's sad but that's the way we've been brought up to look at it
sw04097-B_013186-013871 and i hate it but there comes a time when when this is what what happens
sw04097-B_013871-014575 especially with the way medicine is today It's keeping us alive longer and
sw04097-B_014575-014846 we're living longer so therefore you know
sw04097-B_015503-015636 right
sw04097-B_016078-016265 yeah it's kind of our
sw04097-B_016915-017003 right
sw04097-B_017751-017858 uh-huh
sw04097-B_018125-018392 the cost is just unreal [laughter]
sw04097-B_019989-020216 right well that's
sw04097-B_020822-020927 uh-huh
sw04097-B_021750-021893 right right
sw04097-B_022815-024093 well it is especially since he lives in Mississippi i live in Texas and my sister lives in Louisiana [laughter] This this you know it makes fact i just got back from having to go stay with him because she needed to get away
sw04097-B_024093-024284 and it's uh
sw04097-B_024284-024937 but uh i don't know what other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place
sw04097-B_025433-026633 well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that really is what bothers us uh he could start a fire just about anything [laughter] could happen
sw04097-B_026633-026751 [vocalized-noise]
sw04097-B_027507-027652 uh-huh
sw04097-B_027652-027797 right
sw04097-B_028921-029032 right
sw04098-A_000000-000176 [noise] oh i guess i started it
sw04098-A_000176-000315 bust away
sw04098-A_000563-000832 oh um New York
sw04098-A_000832-000951 yeah
sw04098-A_000951-001101 uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
sw04098-A_001101-001253 yeah well
sw04098-A_001496-001698 yeah i know i pay too much
sw04098-A_001698-002112 yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um
sw04098-A_002112-003280 the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just propor[tional]- i'm i'm viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage
sw04098-A_003280-003836 and on the bad years i'm not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i don't pay below average
sw04098-A_004035-004214 yeah yeah i'm a consultant
sw04098-A_004214-004941 you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back
sw04098-A_005133-005382 there was that went away a few years ago
sw04098-A_005382-005548 and uh
sw04098-A_005548-005966 you know whatev[er]- you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed
sw04098-A_005966-006248 [laughter] but uh i don't know for sure
sw04098-A_006248-006372 um
sw04098-A_006700-007281 well i didn't say value um i'm just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount
sw04098-A_007386-007750 uh no not at the moment not at [laughter-present]
sw04098-A_007750-007854 um
sw04098-A_007956-008150 yeah yeah yeah
sw04098-A_008150-008249 well that's
sw04098-A_008899-009309 yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't
sw04098-A_009309-009490 make it desirable
sw04098-A_009490-009601 yeah
sw04098-A_009881-010231 yeah yeah well unless you're up in the uh mega bucks range
sw04098-A_010391-010507 [laughter]
sw04098-A_010507-010752 [laughter] but um
sw04098-A_010902-011451 yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar
sw04098-A_011451-012241 i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something
sw04098-A_012241-012405 you know
sw04098-A_012405-012885 so uh you know what's going in -[ha]s got to be a lot more -[th]an going out if it can pay for all that stuff
sw04098-A_013380-013704 well i'm not really talking about um
sw04098-A_013804-014463 who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things
sw04098-A_014463-014599 in the middle
sw04098-A_014599-014721 yeah that's what i meant
sw04098-A_014721-014811 [vocalized-noise]
sw04098-A_014811-014929 what's that
sw04098-A_015031-015394 well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up ano[ther]- billion
sw04098-A_015502-015612 and uh
sw04098-A_015612-015800 business as [laughter-usual]
sw04098-A_016694-017070 i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean
sw04098-A_017070-017179 yeah
sw04098-A_017951-018076 right
sw04098-A_018442-018552 um-hum
sw04098-A_019249-019484 well that's the theory um
sw04098-A_019942-020053 um-hum
sw04098-A_020153-020264 yeah
sw04098-A_021213-022415 yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it worki[ng]- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities
sw04098-A_022415-023570 i'm sorry on[ly]- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can [rec[oncentrated]-/concentrated] uh concentrated then it is taxed
sw04098-A_023672-024003 so um i don't claim to understand that [laughter]
sw04098-A_024003-024201 you know that's um
sw04098-A_024201-024999 and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and
sw04098-A_024999-025161 hope people -[w]ill stop
sw04098-A_025161-025327 yeah but you know we
sw04098-A_025503-026346 liquor yeah thing is you know you got to l[ook]- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people [laughter]
sw04098-A_026724-026855 hm
sw04098-A_027968-028089 hm
sw04098-A_028194-028291 right
sw04098-A_028516-028650 really
sw04098-A_029050-029168 yeah
sw04098-A_029303-029628 you know i um we get a tax here
sw04098-A_029628-029828 that um
sw04098-A_029828-029952 what do you call it uh
sw04098-B_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04098-B_000119-000292 oh okay_1
sw04098-B_000292-000633 so uh where you from just in general
sw04098-B_000633-000763 state
sw04098-B_000763-001043 New York okay i'm in New Jersey
sw04098-B_001043-001622 okay_1 so uh i guess we're talk about taxes uh so what do you
sw04098-B_001622-001809 you pay too much
sw04098-B_003258-003386 um-hum
sw04098-B_003811-004159 oh are you like a small business or something or
sw04098-B_004159-004334 oh okay
sw04098-B_004768-005220 isn't it their like [vocalized-noise] um income averaging or something like that
sw04098-B_005321-005565 oh okay [laughter]
sw04098-B_005926-006048 oh
sw04098-B_006198-006304 huh
sw04098-B_006304-006762 so why why do you think you don't get uh anything enough for your value i mean
sw04098-B_007223-007419 oh you a single
sw04098-B_007550-007681 um-hum
sw04098-B_007681-008148 uh i know singles pay more than married people
sw04098-B_008148-008661 and i'm single i know that and i pay quite a bit higher than a married person
sw04098-B_008661-009010 where if you don't happen to buy a house or something like that
sw04098-B_009290-009465 and you don't uh
sw04098-B_009465-009929 yeah that's about_1 the only uh tax uh write off you can get these days
sw04098-B_010208-010486 well yeah buy a yacht or some[thing]-
sw04098-B_010635-010992 but i guess they took away that and they're yelling and screaming about that
sw04098-B_012197-012467 um-hum yeah
sw04098-B_012809-013443 well it depends if it's you know a a regressive tax or a progressive tax
sw04098-B_014442-014684 well no yeah
sw04098-B_014684-015146 borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time it's like
sw04098-B_015402-015504 yeah
sw04098-B_015504-015753 i don't know i- i
sw04098-B_015753-016855 uh i don['t]- know uh here in New Jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think it's uh regressive tax it's just as worse
sw04098-B_017006-018479 progressive um i[t's]- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive
sw04098-B_018479-019373 you know and so the i[dea]- idea behind that is to to you know that's why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least suppose[dly]-
sw04098-B_019373-020203 you know that's what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat f[lat]- percentage tax um across the board
sw04098-B_020203-021387 and e[ven]- and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and a[nd]-
sw04098-B_023591-023678 uh-huh
sw04098-B_023678-023749 [laughter]
sw04098-B_023980-024109 um-hum
sw04098-B_024794-024898 yeah
sw04098-B_024998-025195 yeah sin taxes
sw04098-B_025195-025751 you don't need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live
sw04098-B_026351-026830 well it's to a degree if uh you know if you're addicted it's not going to matter but
sw04098-B_026830-027987 um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities
sw04098-B_027987-029325 so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water [laughter] it's crazy um you know you you see what you it's got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utility's thir[teen]- thirteen percent
sw04099-A_000000-000279 -[ok]ay i guess we're talking about exercise huh

sw04099-A_021488-022028 and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things

sw04099-A_027347-027949 oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after
sw04099-A_028111-028233 yeah
sw04099-A_028233-028507 my legs really really ache
sw04099-A_028507-028879 but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before
sw04099-A_029594-029952 [laughter]
sw04099-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04099-B_000039-000123 okay
sw04099-B_000224-000589 yeah yeah well first of all i i ha[ve]- have to ask you how how old you are
sw04099-B_000692-001714 twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are [laughter] but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis
sw04099-B_001818-002287 well i do um {jazzercise} which is an aerobic um
sw04099-B_002287-002644 program that are you familiar with it
sw04099-B_002644-003497 it's uh you know a national company and we have a {jazzercise} center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can
sw04099-B_003605-005006 no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
sw04099-B_005115-005469 no i only do it [noise] probably two or three times a week
sw04099-B_005469-005795 the minimum they want you to do is three times a week
sw04099-B_006211-006445 well it's really a
sw04099-B_006445-007154 i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can
sw04099-B_007154-007888 so like i usually choose to go like at nine thirty in the morning or or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
sw04099-B_007989-008650 no i go by myself an[d]- and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
sw04099-B_008650-009229 and most of my friends that are my age don't [laughter-exercise] [vocalized-noise] or they might play tennis
sw04099-B_009229-010697 and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
sw04099-B_010697-010953 you know with with children between the ages
sw04099-B_011057-011743 young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do
sw04099-B_012175-012348 oh great
sw04099-B_012449-012640 yeah so you play everyday
sw04099-B_012741-013047 well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just
sw04099-B_013047-013161 you know
sw04099-B_013269-013384 yeah
sw04099-B_014432-015054 well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
sw04099-B_015054-016146 i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat
sw04099-B_016146-016877 you know but you'll come b[eing]- being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will
sw04099-B_017260-017900 well it might not [laughter] it might n[ot]- because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i
sw04099-B_017900-018355 i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
sw04099-B_018355-019044 and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
sw04099-B_019316-019679 yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball
sw04099-B_020349-020689 but do you ski being in Utah i was wondering if you skied
sw04099-B_020795-020972 oh did it really
sw04099-B_020972-021313 because_1 i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great
sw04099-B_021418-021551 yeah
sw04099-B_021979-023121 yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it Tahoe where you ski from
sw04099-B_023121-023715 no that's Nevada to California i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
sw04099-B_023715-024119 but there's a funn[y]- there is a place in Utah called a funny name
sw04099-B_024249-024612 but it's like oh Heavenly is that it
sw04099-B_024612-024813 yeah i think it's called Heavenly
sw04099-B_024914-025084 you've never heard of that
sw04099-B_025084-025333 well maybe it isn't in Utah i don't know
sw04099-B_025333-026252 but they said they've skied Heavenly and [laughter] [laughter-it] [laughter-sounded] [laughter-like] [laughter-you] know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny
sw04099-B_026720-027428 oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i c[an]- mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
sw04099-B_027428-027527 and
sw04099-B_027817-028299 and then is it you[r]- your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and
sw04099-B_028400-028522 yeah
sw04099-B_028522-028631 yeah
sw04099-B_028850-029526 well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding
sw04099-B_029526-029952 and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over
sw04100-A_000000-000018 [noise]
sw04100-A_000018-000622 uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here
sw04100-A_000622-001396 and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will
sw04100-A_001396-002546 have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for
sw04100-A_004070-004205 [noise]
sw04100-A_005224-005326 [noise]
sw04100-A_005669-005946 that's amusing [laughter] yeah
sw04100-A_006231-007481 yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and
sw04100-A_007481-007967 and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge
sw04100-A_007967-008358 [noise]
sw04100-A_008358-008500 yeah
sw04100-A_010593-010725 yeah
sw04100-A_011386-012569 the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but
sw04100-A_012569-013435 it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way
sw04100-A_013435-013908 we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place
sw04100-A_013908-014883 because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them_1 will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical
sw04100-A_014883-015320 instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance
sw04100-A_015320-015712 i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are
sw04100-A_017311-017394 [laughter]
sw04100-A_017394-017494 yeah
sw04100-A_018906-019082 well that's pretty good
sw04100-A_019274-019400 [laughter]
sw04100-A_022688-023534 that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives
sw04100-A_023534-024374 i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research
sw04100-A_024374-025086 so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh
sw04100-A_025086-026013 physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits
sw04100-A_026013-026957 and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that
sw04100-A_027058-028223 um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort
sw04100-A_028223-028317 hm
sw04100-A_029101-029226 yeah
sw04100-B_002514-003654 that's true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits
sw04100-B_003654-004637 uh even though you could you might never have any need for them_1 uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy
sw04100-B_004637-005617 must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesn't matter that you're single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears
sw04100-B_005617-006304 and uh [laughter] it's that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me
sw04100-B_007211-007798 uh drug treat[ment]- yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're
sw04100-B_007798-008443 even if you're a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you [laughter-know]
sw04100-B_008443-009152 uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh
sw04100-B_009152-009622 uh if y[ou]- if you have a a full gamut of
sw04100-B_009622-010889 of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company [vocalized-noise] is wi[lling]- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra[ther]- prefer to do is say
sw04100-B_010889-011473 don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something
sw04100-B_012414-012543 right
sw04100-B_014813-014965 um-hum
sw04100-B_015666-016192 yeah i think that uh a a lot of them_1 are that way they uh th[ey]-
sw04100-B_016192-017110 they dea[l]- they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary [carrer/carrier] and who's the secondary carrier but um
sw04100-B_017110-017958 uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh
sw04100-B_017958-018968 the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month
sw04100-B_018968-020195 it is i'm very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um
sw04100-B_020195-021516 there's a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that
sw04100-B_021516-022809 um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know g[o]- work further on a degree or or get a master's degree of something uh uh course
sw04100-B_023484-023636 um-hum
sw04100-B_026635-026776 um-hum
sw04100-B_028053-028321 yeah we don't have that either
sw04100-B_028321-029134 uh in in some ways i think it's it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and
sw04100-B_029134-029885 and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody ex[tra]-
sw04101-A_000000-000081 [noise]
sw04101-A_000630-000703 um-hum
sw04101-A_002195-002989 [noise] well here in Saskatoon um [noise] much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh
sw04101-A_002989-004161 [noise] any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people [noise] uh [noise] there are areas where we could uh [noise] actually we have a couple of the uh
sw04101-A_004161-004727 handicapped societies type of places where they uh [noise]
sw04101-A_004727-005666 one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we're able to uh [noise]
sw04101-A_005666-006286 have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are
sw04101-A_006286-007574 there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so we're able to uh [noise] take it to one of the uh [noise]
sw04101-A_007574-008690 rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers [vocalized-noise] they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then
sw04101-A_008791-009303 right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing
sw04101-A_009303-010375 [noise] and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have
sw04101-A_010375-011016 o[ne]- one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum [noise] cans as well
sw04101-A_011016-012156 [noise] and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so [noise]
sw04101-A_012156-013241 uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
sw04101-A_014216-014459 well actually there's
sw04101-A_014459-014693 there's the opportunity for both
sw04101-A_014693-014927 [noise] generally the uh
sw04101-A_014927-016082 the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to re[cycle]- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
sw04101-A_016082-016911 [noise] and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
sw04101-A_016911-017913 and then i have a then then they in turn will get [noise] some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well [noise]
sw04101-A_021252-022136 um yeah [noise] um i guess partly because of our climate here in Saskatoon at least the majority of
sw04101-A_022136-022927 Central C[anada]- uh well i want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to be referred more to Ontario and Quebec
sw04101-A_022927-023020 [noise]
sw04101-A_023020-023150 but um
sw04101-A_023150-024364 we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on [welfor/welfare] welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing [noise] um
sw04101-A_024364-024708 there's psychological pressure against
sw04101-A_024708-025203 employing people to do that kind of thing although um
sw04101-A_025203-025384 scouts and
sw04101-A_025384-026605 hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
sw04101-A_026806-027055 [noise] they have done it some
sw04101-A_027055-027925 um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers they're actually at
sw04101-A_027925-028937 virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries
sw04101-A_028937-029628 collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
sw04101-A_029628-029818 um some of the
sw04101-B_000000-001193 [noise] hey Steve um they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think actually this is my first experience with recycling program but um instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about
sw04101-B_001193-002319 um i'm starting to split stu[ff]- sp[lit]- split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there
sw04101-B_008557-008857 but the deposits only on like drink stuff
sw04101-B_008857-008996 okay
sw04101-B_009261-009385 okay
sw04101-B_010965-011139 oh okay
sw04101-B_013204-013955 so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money
sw04101-B_013955-014348 or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you
sw04101-B_014668-014822 oh okay
sw04101-B_017807-019094 that's very cool you know there's a i i heard about a a similar program in New York City where uh i think it's called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people
sw04101-B_019094-020239 to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them_1 up to a one
sw04101-B_020239-021370 lo[cation]- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and and get more money to these people that desperately need it
sw04101-B_022859-023051 [laughter] yeah
sw04101-B_026518-026756 do they do it with newspapers as well
sw04101-B_029612-029697 hm
sw04102-A_000000-000008 [noise]
sw04102-A_000008-000353 so what do you think about caring for older folks Dale
sw04102-A_000869-000990 uh-huh
sw04102-A_001974-002146 right very definitely
sw04102-A_002397-002544 uh-huh
sw04102-A_002544-003791 well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old They aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out My mamma is a dialysis patient
sw04102-A_003791-004646 and she is only about sixty four but she's had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
sw04102-A_004646-005349 and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person
sw04102-A_005349-005755 and doesn't like having having people
sw04102-A_005755-006153 uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
sw04102-A_006153-006310 uh
sw04102-A_006310-007200 i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home
sw04102-A_007200-007933 and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety
sw04102-A_007933-008191 i think right on ninety right now
sw04102-A_008191-008659 and he's living by himself My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
sw04102-A_008659-009561 so but he's you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people i'd like to see them stay at home
sw04102-A_009990-010077 uh-huh
sw04102-A_010690-010784 uh-huh
sw04102-A_011019-011115 right
sw04102-A_011566-011708 right
sw04102-A_012645-012896 right especially for your uncle i bet
sw04102-A_013091-014251 now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer Do they have anything like that in Dallas
sw04102-A_016088-016274 right So they are pretty limited
sw04102-A_016274-016935 oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology
sw04102-A_017056-017515 well had a job for a while where she went around to
sw04102-A_017515-018163 to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives
sw04102-A_018163-018662 to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities
sw04102-A_018662-019579 i don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients but just patients in [vocalized-noise] people in general who were not as independent as they use to be
sw04102-A_021748-021836 uh-huh
sw04102-A_021961-022070 right
sw04102-A_022871-022945 uh-huh
sw04102-A_023236-023342 right
sw04102-A_023475-023816 to need uh get there and to participate in the activities
sw04102-A_024644-024807 right
sw04102-A_024807-024977 right
sw04102-A_025340-025552 that's true You can't play those things
sw04102-A_025670-025928 but you can sing songs and uh
sw04102-A_025928-026501 tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about you're was it your grand mother
sw04102-A_026501-026690 that was having Alzheimer
sw04102-A_026690-027789 uh being able to tell old stories You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way
sw04102-A_028390-028700 do they like to listen to other people recollect though
sw04102-A_028700-028996 [noise]
sw04102-A_029353-029463 right
sw04102-A_029704-029885 well that is good because we
sw04102-B_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04102-B_000362-000923 well i think um the elderly is a really neat population to care for
sw04102-B_000923-001131 they've got a lot of special needs
sw04102-B_001131-001407 and at the same time
sw04102-B_001407-001513 um
sw04102-B_001513-001769 majority of them don't want to give up
sw04102-B_001769-001990 the independence that they have
sw04102-B_001990-002114 [noise]
sw04102-B_002114-002446 and so you've got a real balance to make there
sw04102-B_002446-002592 what about you
sw04102-B_003745-003889 um-hum
sw04102-B_006111-006221 uh-huh
sw04102-B_006942-007085 [noise]
sw04102-B_007085-007307 [laughter]
sw04102-B_008129-008256 oh really
sw04102-B_008620-008787 oh okay
sw04102-B_009560-010011 yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties
sw04102-B_010011-010709 and she's uh suffering from a low uh well uh progressive Alzheimer's disease
sw04102-B_010709-011034 so she doesn't remember anybody
sw04102-B_011034-011156 and
sw04102-B_011156-011640 uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young
sw04102-B_011640-012385 and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
sw04102-B_012385-012695 and it's creating a lot of problems
sw04102-B_012822-013023 oh yes yes
sw04102-B_014235-015027 in Dallas um yeah i've he[ard]- i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them
sw04102-B_015027-016066 but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there [vocalized-noise] for the day program and pick them up
sw04102-B_016216-016344 right
sw04102-B_018120-018261 oh really
sw04102-B_018606-018706 um-hum
sw04102-B_019521-019629 um-hum
sw04102-B_019629-019737 um-hum
sw04102-B_019737-020614 well it's it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the peop[le]- if the people are able
sw04102-B_020614-021732 and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active
sw04102-B_021732-021966 and their body just hasn't kept up with them
sw04102-B_022082-022844 and i think that's in a way somewhere some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off
sw04102-B_022844-023237 because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
sw04102-B_023757-023889 right
sw04102-B_023889-024720 cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work
sw04102-B_024720-024883 and sports
sw04102-B_024883-025122 but if your vision is gone
sw04102-B_025122-025355 and you have arthritis real badly
sw04102-B_025495-025667 yeah you can't do it
sw04102-B_025863-026007 well that's true
sw04102-B_026439-026567 uh-huh
sw04102-B_026567-026698 uh-huh
sw04102-B_027802-028421 and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory
sw04102-B_028690-029424 my grandmother doesn't [laughter] she wou[ld]- she wants to te[ll]- to tell you about her story over again so
sw04102-B_029424-029697 which is fine you know so
sw04103-A_000000-000038 [noise]
sw04103-A_000038-001000 um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is
sw04103-A_001000-001399 uh put the data into Quicken i don't know if you're familiar with that
sw04103-A_002806-002932 um-hum
sw04103-A_003180-003305 hm
sw04103-A_003305-004178 i i've found that it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because_1 what -[w]ill happen is my wife or i'll write a few checks and then we'll uh
sw04103-A_004283-004373 uh
sw04103-A_004373-004541 not bother to total it
sw04103-A_004541-004987 and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it [vocalized-noise] helps with that
sw04103-A_007259-007364 um
sw04103-A_007994-008579 uh actually we haven't had to y[et]- y[et]- uh uh until just recently i guess we've got a
sw04103-A_008579-008951 a daughter who's eighteen months and another one on the way so
sw04103-A_008951-009263 we need to start doing more of that just for uh
sw04103-A_009263-009521 you know saving for college and things like that
sw04103-A_009521-009928 we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for
sw04103-A_010028-010112 um
sw04103-A_011719-011839 um-hum
sw04103-A_012264-012369 hm
sw04103-A_013061-013183 hm
sw04103-A_013183-013365 sounds good
sw04103-A_013365-013737 yeah i guess we're we're just at the point m[y]- uh
sw04103-A_013737-014451 my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's lot more interesting trying to
sw04103-A_014451-014858 find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to
sw04103-A_014858-014950 um
sw04103-A_014950-015197 do it just you know kind of enforce the savings
sw04103-A_015314-015596 but uh it'll be interesting to see
sw04103-A_015596-015770 [vocalized-noise]
sw04103-A_017010-017119 hm
sw04103-A_017950-018066 um
sw04103-A_018332-018474 that sounds good
sw04103-A_018574-018677 but uh
sw04103-A_018677-019047 uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
sw04103-A_019047-019160 oh
sw04103-A_019160-019290 okay
sw04103-A_019290-019519 um Cincinnati actually
sw04103-A_019519-020100 i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people
sw04103-A_020200-020457 are uh going to be involved in this but
sw04103-A_020457-020584 uh
sw04103-A_020584-020837 well that's interesting i'm uh
sw04103-A_020947-021038 [vocalized-noise]
sw04103-A_021038-021891 uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another
sw04103-A_022909-023297 oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh
sw04103-A_024061-024199 um-hum
sw04103-A_024199-024501 yeah it'll be interesting to see what they [vocalized-noise]
sw04103-A_024602-025119 it'd be interesting to see how the data base [vocalized-noise] well i guess we're talking about the experiment and
sw04103-A_025119-025332 probably try to get back on the
sw04103-A_025332-025855 topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without
sw04103-A_025855-026177 getting to uh dollar figures i guess
sw04103-A_026177-026456 you know we could talk about some of the long range goals
sw04103-A_026562-026676 yeah
sw04103-A_026899-027025 um
sw04103-A_027025-027546 well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
sw04103-A_027546-027676 uh
sw04103-A_027676-027831 i guess we'll have to
sw04103-A_027831-028796 factor that in if we['re]- if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement
sw04103-A_028796-029169 i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh
sw04103-A_029169-029939 now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's it's a real shift from what we had before uh because_1 we're
sw04103-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04103-B_001347-001808 yeah i've uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh
sw04103-B_001808-003237 i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now
sw04103-B_004519-004643 um-hum
sw04103-B_004986-005220 yeah well i
sw04103-B_005220-005745 have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we
sw04103-B_005745-006353 try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we'll get behind like you say but uh
sw04103-B_006484-007295 it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we r[emember]- just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
sw04103-B_007412-007996 well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances
sw04103-B_008883-009004 um-hum
sw04103-B_009951-010246 yeah well that's pretty good if you can do that i know
sw04103-B_010246-010998 i have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but um
sw04103-B_010998-011966 we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so
sw04103-B_011966-012835 we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be
sw04103-B_012835-013133 putting away for her college fund
sw04103-B_014193-014309 um-hum
sw04103-B_015188-015297 um-hum
sw04103-B_015601-016549 well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently
sw04103-B_016549-016711 uh
sw04103-B_016711-017080 took on a full time job well almost full time
sw04103-B_017080-018045 so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and
sw04103-B_018045-018348 significant travel and that kind of thing
sw04103-B_019050-019214 ah Wisconsin
sw04103-B_019214-019353 how about_1 you
sw04103-B_020425-020540 um-hum
sw04103-B_021987-022554 uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over
sw04103-B_022554-022685 um
sw04103-B_022685-022990 the computer network called internet
sw04103-B_023332-023619 and he just forwarded that on to me and
sw04103-B_023619-023761 um
sw04103-B_023761-024199 it sounded like it'd be an interesting project to participate in so i
sw04103-B_024199-024347 sent
sw04103-B_024347-024556 sent back some E-mail
sw04103-B_025065-025186 um-hum
sw04103-B_026116-026240 um-hum
sw04103-B_026532-026896 what other long range goals do you have besides college
sw04103-B_027487-027617 um-hum
sw04103-B_028747-028849 um-hum
sw04104-A_000000-000221 [noise] anyway uh [noise]
sw04104-A_000367-001135 what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos [laughter] um
sw04104-A_001135-001666 right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh
sw04104-A_001666-002108 it's called living within your means [laughter]
sw04104-A_002108-002777 you know which means at the moment um paying off the Visa bill and keeping everything else under control
sw04104-A_002777-003146 and hoping the car doesn't collapse [laughter]
sw04104-A_003319-003840 um but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment um
sw04104-A_003840-005187 but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i don't [noise] usually don't exceed that unless i unless the Visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that
sw04104-A_005187-005584 that then it goes through the moon so
sw04104-A_005802-006029 yeah so um
sw04104-A_006029-006190 what'd you
sw04104-A_007850-008082 so you can afford to get a house
sw04104-A_008257-008430 [laughter]
sw04104-A_008430-008580 [noise] yes
sw04104-A_010094-010217 yeah
sw04104-A_010977-011199 so what do you and your husband do
sw04104-A_011336-011500 are you really

sw04104-A_013583-013722 really
sw04104-A_013722-013934 really how long would you be there
sw04104-A_014614-014797 with with what church
sw04104-A_015012-015972 oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as i recall
sw04104-A_016073-017079 th[ere]- there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was [vocalized-noise] so um are you uh are you uh active in translation
sw04104-A_018013-018121 um-hum
sw04104-A_020437-021100 true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course
sw04104-A_022083-022218 um-hum
sw04104-A_022539-022720 [noise]
sw04104-A_024090-024281 in France
sw04104-A_026785-027161 [laughter]
sw04104-A_027161-027272 um
sw04104-A_027451-027634 must have been terrible
sw04104-A_027634-027852 the um
sw04104-A_027852-028167 was it Henry Macon said that the
sw04104-A_028167-029302 the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die
sw04104-A_029302-029857 and i it it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that free style English is just
sw04104-A_029857-029952 takes on n[ew]-
sw04104-B_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04104-B_000146-000396 how about you what do you do with your budget
sw04104-B_000744-000852 [noise]
sw04104-B_001901-002050 uh-huh
sw04104-B_002704-002811 [noise]
sw04104-B_003115-003301 yeah that's true
sw04104-B_005551-005751 yeah that sort of a problem
sw04104-B_006040-006299 we're trying we're trying
sw04104-B_006299-006457 to um
sw04104-B_006457-006936 so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is
sw04104-B_006936-007056 so
sw04104-B_007056-007716 not much on that side of it [laughter] to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings
sw04104-B_007716-007938 and stuff like that but
sw04104-B_008093-008464 yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
sw04104-B_008464-008879 but we don't know how long it will be a dream
sw04104-B_008879-009335 we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
sw04104-B_009335-009851 but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um
sw04104-B_009954-011001 economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
sw04104-B_011191-011539 we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh
sw04104-B_011539-012369 and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
sw04104-B_012369-012701 and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
sw04104-B_012701-013150 and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
sw04104-B_013150-013300 so
sw04104-B_013406-013600 Africa Nigeria
sw04104-B_013700-013800 yeah
sw04104-B_013909-014650 about four years we're career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year
sw04104-B_014753-015120 um we're with Wycliffe Bible Translators
sw04104-B_015120-015257 so
sw04104-B_015919-016199 yeah they could very well and
sw04104-B_017001-018152 um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh
sw04104-B_018152-018923 came home and got married and we will go ba[ck]- back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family
sw04104-B_018923-019306 as translators well i always wanted to do translation
sw04104-B_019306-020049 but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
sw04104-B_020049-020465 you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
sw04104-B_021055-022104 well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
sw04104-B_022104-022605 you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
sw04104-B_022605-022963 and how to do market stuff but in about
sw04104-B_022963-024157 um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but it's uh Senegalese French so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um
sw04104-B_024157-024802 in France yeah because they're real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and
sw04104-B_024802-025764 i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
sw04104-B_025764-026492 said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
sw04104-B_026492-027165 since then i have refrained from speaking any French [laughter] except in Senegal [laughter]
sw04104-B_027165-027558 i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
sw04105-A_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04105-A_003096-004353 that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
sw04105-A_004353-004990 was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here
sw04105-A_004990-005881 at one point i'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise Idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me
sw04105-A_007153-007296 um-hum
sw04105-A_011642-011802 um-hum
sw04105-A_013396-013789 i agree with that uh i found though that
sw04105-A_013789-014766 that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule
sw04105-A_014766-015317 and i can't remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week
sw04105-A_015317-016138 so the uh it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason
sw04105-A_016138-017110 no one raises an eyebrow but because of that i'm not a clock watcher [noise] if i if i knew they were expecting me there
sw04105-A_017110-017751 at eight thirty every day and i couldn't leave until five i- i think i'd be uh
sw04105-A_017751-018388 uh have a greater tendency to wait until the clock hit five and then say i['m]- out of here
sw04105-A_018609-018756 right
sw04105-A_020439-020803 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-that's] [laughter-correct] that's correct
sw04105-A_021770-021946 [laughter]
sw04105-A_022150-022288 right
sw04105-A_022288-022484 [laughter]
sw04105-A_022728-022886 another [vocalized-noise]
sw04105-A_022986-023126 um-hum
sw04105-A_024115-024303 wow [laughter]
sw04105-A_025308-025437 um-hum
sw04105-A_025705-025840 right
sw04105-A_025840-025976 [vocalized-noise]
sw04105-A_025976-026592 uh the company i'm working for now starts everyone out at three weeks vacation
sw04105-A_026715-027732 and i- i thought that was great except during the first year i ended up only being able to take about a week and a half of it [laughter]
sw04105-A_027986-028309 right i was i was so busy uh
sw04105-A_028309-029275 and it we've got a very small department and i was just uh wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take time off and when i
sw04105-A_029275-029689 did take the time off i'd uh get calls from work anyway
sw04105-A_029689-029895 so it's only been uh in th[e]-
sw04105-B_000000-000085 [noise] okay_1 well
sw04105-B_000085-001511 lets see i i guess i'll i'll mention it i always one of the things i always considered was real important about job benefits i always uh [vocalized-noise] i know they can't do anything about it but i always thought location and quality of life in the region was important towards
sw04105-B_001511-001941 a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is
sw04105-B_001941-002802 i[n]- in my job an[d]- an[d]- an[d]- besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work
sw04105-B_002802-003248 but see those are the things that they can't really do much about [laughter]
sw04105-B_005502-005628 um-hum
sw04105-B_005835-006159 yeah the uh [vocalized-noise] i was uh
sw04105-B_006159-007311 i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer [client/climate] climate uh so
sw04105-B_007311-007768 uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt uh
sw04105-B_007768-008240 i've worked in uh San Diego and i've worked in Atlanta so you can see that i've moved
sw04105-B_008240-008944 moved father south since then [laughter] uh i used to live in Ohio when i when i was going to school
sw04105-B_008944-010047 and uh it's still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh Baltimore and uh Boston
sw04105-B_010047-010763 and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity
sw04105-B_010763-011178 always used to bother me because_1 i really never got into the winter sports
sw04105-B_011178-011743 but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me
sw04105-B_011743-012691 uh other job benefited jo[b]- job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible
sw04105-B_012691-013489 uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you can't do too much and i understand that
sw04105-B_018180-019246 you're out of there yeah [laughter] you then you then you punch in a clock and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say well you know why should i give them_1 anymore
sw04105-B_019246-020248 but what they [vocalized-noise] uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i- i- i take it then that you are also a professional
sw04105-B_020248-020555 [laughter] a salaried employee [laughter]
sw04105-B_020555-020954 [laughter] uh it
sw04105-B_020954-021841 usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i- i- i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up the hours and
sw04105-B_021841-022213 i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour
sw04105-B_022213-023246 oops [laughter] bu[t]- uh well let's see what other i i've always liked i've always liked some vacation i i've i've been fortunate i actually had a
sw04105-B_023246-023659 uh the com[pany]- i just just transferred jobs about a week ago [laughter]
sw04105-B_023659-024162 [laughter] so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation
sw04105-B_024284-024721 now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility
sw04105-B_024721-025491 uh but of course now i've gone to zero amount of years in the company so now i'm back to the
sw04105-B_025491-026066 to the uh original two weeks [laughter] that was a tough benefit to give up
sw04105-B_026539-026802 yeah that is a good benefit
sw04105-B_027586-028067 right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done
sw04106-A_000000-000630 [noise] so it says how do you keep up on news um i suppose i had longer to think about it so i'll just uh answer the question i
sw04106-A_000630-002000 i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost effect[ive]- or time effective way to do it because on TV you have to t[o]- put up with all the happy talk and the commercials
sw04106-A_002000-003372 and um then on uh like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record Na[tional]- All Things Considered from National Public Radio
sw04106-A_003372-004784 and i- i when i ride the bike m[y]- ride my bike to campus i i [laughter-have] it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
sw04106-A_004784-004948 and how about_1 you
sw04106-A_005448-005550 um-hum
sw04106-A_005550-005648 um-hum
sw04106-A_006449-006556 hm
sw04106-A_006556-006969 all the all the AIDS cases in Miami for example
sw04106-A_006969-007498 yeah that's right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh
sw04106-A_007498-008624 most of the time s[lanted]- tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not not not them alone but
sw04106-A_008624-009230 most of the news media but probably they [laughter-more] more uh strongly than a lot of the others
sw04106-A_009230-010303 have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know ju[st]- just don't report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news
sw04106-A_010900-011372 hm i don't know but i think that for example after the uh
sw04106-A_011372-012475 after the uh Iran Iraq War when uh oil oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i'm sure they did you just didn't hear about it
sw04106-A_012475-013691 so um i- i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there's no other game in town except for monitor which is y[ou]- you know about um about the Christian Science monitor program
sw04106-A_013691-013819 uh
sw04106-A_013819-014156 no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program
sw04106-A_014156-014277 but that's
sw04106-A_014378-014495 i'm sorry
sw04106-A_015262-016276 right yeah that it i- i don't think they well i mean i know they don't broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i'm in another part of the country so
sw04106-A_016276-017047 uh you know i mean they're they're really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that's
sw04106-A_017047-017874 that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the McNeil Leh[rer]- Lehrer news hour but that's on TV and then you've got to be sitting there
sw04106-A_019322-019449 yeah
sw04106-A_019962-020088 um-hum
sw04106-A_020380-020837 yeah well at least it's not the same slant is is All Things Considered huh
sw04106-A_020837-022006 so that's that's true yeah bu[t]- now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or USA Today but um
sw04106-A_022006-023348 they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one
sw04106-A_024071-024200 um-hum
sw04106-A_024315-024435 right
sw04106-A_024435-025767 i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don't know how i acquired a Wall Street Journal it just happened uh last month there was a story on recycling uh i think actually that was a column one story though
sw04106-A_025767-027048 but uh that talked about the way that uh some communities are trying to recycle so much that [laughter-they] [laughter-don't] have anybody to buy the stuff from them_1 to reprocess and in one locality i think it was Portland ended up burning
sw04106-A_027048-027499 the stuff some of [laughter-it] some of it because there's [laughter-nothing] else they could do with it
sw04106-A_027609-027789 yeah
sw04106-A_027789-028644 so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just
sw04106-A_028644-029256 that was the only thing but it was it was good uh discussion of the markets for various recycled products
sw04106-B_000000-000046 [noise]
sw04106-B_000153-000245 right
sw04106-B_000367-000465 [laughter]
sw04106-B_000569-000691 okay
sw04106-B_001860-001980 yeah
sw04106-B_003298-003412 right
sw04106-B_004164-004287 uh-huh
sw04106-B_004771-004900 oh okay
sw04106-B_004900-005635 uh that's interesting i['ve]- i've never heard of the news letters angle i'm also an All Things Considered person Weekend Edition whatever
sw04106-B_005635-006604 uh i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things i'd just had soon not hear for about two minutes
sw04106-B_006752-006871 yeah
sw04106-B_006871-007042 yeah exactly
sw04106-B_010288-011030 yeah although i think that's probably uh true of most news coverage in general good news isn't news right
sw04106-B_012379-012507 right
sw04106-B_013681-013943 uh yeah on television or radio
sw04106-B_014156-015297 yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they they broadcast that i think between five AM and six AM which is a a little before i get up so i usually miss it
sw04106-B_016199-016328 right
sw04106-B_017896-018515 yeah like like you i of[ten]- i rarely spend time watching news on TV the uh
sw04106-B_018515-019376 i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn't usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like McNeil Lehrer so
sw04106-B_019376-019660 for me it's pretty much a diet of uh
sw04106-B_019660-020497 All Things Considered and i like to look at the Wall Street Journal at work which uh i think does a fine job it too has a slant but uh
sw04106-B_020752-020992 yeah exactly and
sw04106-B_023313-024438 yeah i think uh what is it the fourth column of page one is uh kind of famous in it's own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i me[an]-
sw04106-B_024438-024548 [vocalized-noise]
sw04106-B_025350-025483 um-hum
sw04106-B_027012-027132 [laughter]
sw04106-B_027460-027713 right back to square one
sw04106-B_029184-029914 yeah and that's that's the kind of thing the Journal does best i find i don't have time to read through the whole thing certainly but i find if you ju[st]-
sw04107-A_000000-000014 [noise]
sw04107-A_000115-000195 uh
sw04107-A_000195-000861 well i mean in DC there's a law uh that was recently passed that like um
sw04107-A_000861-001175 you have to [noise] it's a law i think that organizations
sw04107-A_001175-001844 have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle it's a law to do it
sw04107-A_002713-002814 right
sw04107-A_004387-004511 [laughter]
sw04107-A_004658-005965 it's like um mean personally i've never been a recycling nut terms of like i don't i don't go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me
sw04107-A_005965-006516 um [noise] more apt to do it because it's there it's more convenient
sw04107-A_006516-006664 right
sw04107-A_007875-008054 right
sw04107-A_009300-009961 yeah i mean i'm looking right here there's a waste bin [vocalized-noise] for waste i don't know i guess they recyc[le]- i guess they can recycle
sw04107-A_009961-011289 normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin i'll put something in there if it fits [noise] they've got cans and bottles um and bins for paper
sw04107-A_011553-011712 no
sw04107-A_011844-012054 no not really i mean
sw04107-A_012290-013513 yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um
sw04107-A_013513-014069 as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably
sw04107-A_014069-014741 i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm pro[bably]- i'm if it was there i'd use it
sw04107-A_015348-015444 yeah
sw04107-A_015444-016923 exactly i mean even in my in my dorm it's in the basement but i pile it i let i let them_1 pile up in the tr[ash]- in my uh in the gar[bage]- in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can
sw04107-A_016923-017796 um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it
sw04107-A_017796-018334 i mean if it's there they're going to do it still i mean some people won't even go that far out of their way
sw04107-A_018334-018741 [noise] there are people who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways
sw04107-A_019218-019352 yeah
sw04107-A_020282-020400 yeah
sw04107-A_020876-021469 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-i'm] sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green
sw04107-A_021469-021635 type of thing
sw04107-A_021635-021921 green thinking should call it
sw04107-A_021921-022108 [noise] people more aware
sw04107-A_022108-022302 more aware they need to save the environment and all that
sw04107-A_022659-022748 right
sw04107-A_022943-023950 oh definitely i mean there's been plenty of uh up roar about the uh Marriott using um styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing
sw04107-A_024668-024768 yeah
sw04107-A_024951-025462 cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have a plastic coated and they're probably even worse i don't really know
sw04107-A_025462-025616 harder to recycle
sw04107-A_026071-026178 yeah
sw04107-A_026378-026740 well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive
sw04107-A_026740-026866 [noise] um
sw04107-A_026866-027874 they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious
sw04107-A_027874-028497 and they i believe they give discounts o[n]- on drinks if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive
sw04107-A_028497-028903 you have a discount on your on your on your drink instead of the regular price or whatever
sw04107-A_029004-029088 yeah
sw04107-A_029411-029545 [laughter] [laughter-right]
sw04107-A_029798-029955 [laughter]
sw04107-B_000000-000037 [noise]
sw04107-B_000037-000349 so well what what are you guys doing with recycling
sw04107-B_001896-003050 yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh incinerator actually only two thirds of the county built it
sw04107-B_003050-004450 and they also of course they had to the New York State EEC the environmental people mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued
sw04107-B_004450-004726 [laughter] has to uh recycle
sw04107-B_006531-007009 yeah a lot of people up here the exact same way you know they won't lift a finger
sw04107-B_007009-007969 and uh it hasn't gotten around here that you know you go to any store or something and there is a trash can there isn't a bin for glass a bin for
sw04107-B_007969-008917 it's it's really just on the ver[ge]- i[t]- it hasn't quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh
sw04107-B_008917-009194 uh Utah had some bins
sw04107-B_011021-011210 [vocalized-noise]
sw04107-B_011210-011899 so you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it
sw04107-B_011899-012001 [noise]
sw04107-B_012001-012349 toss it in the first place that it [vocalized-noise] that you could find
sw04107-B_014748-015434 right well i think well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available
sw04107-B_015434-015564 yeah
sw04107-B_018798-019267 yeah i guess you know my mom she always recycled everything
sw04107-B_019267-019632 so i'm use to it but
sw04107-B_019632-020233 if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn
sw04107-B_020334-020907 so maybe you know the next generation -[w]ill be a little bit more uh conscientious [laughter-than] [laughter-we] [laughter-are]
sw04107-B_022381-022999 course you are on a college campus where people are more aware than the general public
sw04107-B_022999-023150 [laughter]
sw04107-B_023877-025033 n[ow]- now that's really tough because_1 you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic
sw04107-B_025398-025607 y[eah]- who knows what's not
sw04107-B_025607-026152 and uh you know if you put them_1 in a landfill they take up the same amount of space
sw04107-B_026152-026452 because_1 the paper doesn't break down either
sw04107-B_028298-028446 [laughter]
sw04107-B_028872-029565 well that that's good i mean God forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it
sw04107-B_029565-029690 yeah like [laughter]
sw04107-B_029690-029881 [laughter-imagine] that [laughter]
sw04107-B_029881-029955 [laughter]
sw04108-A_000000-000110 [noise] -[ok]ay
sw04108-A_000110-000252 um
sw04108-A_000252-000708 so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home
sw04108-A_001123-001202 hm
sw04108-A_001620-001734 um-hum
sw04108-A_002885-003089 that's true yeah
sw04108-A_003290-003389 hm
sw04108-A_004183-004317 um-hum
sw04108-A_005008-005301 that's true i never thought of that yeah
sw04108-A_005844-006315 that's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with
sw04108-A_006723-007208 yes they really are they don't like to keep them longer than a week
sw04108-A_007208-007372 yeah
sw04108-A_007646-007803 what do you mean
sw04108-A_008555-008751 yeah that's true
sw04108-A_009044-009983 yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own [noise]
sw04108-A_009983-010453 yeah um [noise] i would personally like it if my parents
sw04108-A_010453-011228 were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible
sw04108-A_011228-011409 but um
sw04108-A_011409-011985 to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible [noise]
sw04108-A_012411-012546 right
sw04108-A_012678-012968 um-hum [noise] yeah
sw04108-A_013424-013636 that's true yeah [noise]
sw04108-A_013636-014212 but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them_1 out
sw04108-A_014212-014349 ahead of time
sw04108-A_014689-014813 um-hum
sw04108-A_015569-015712 um-hum
sw04108-A_016162-016322 [noise] yeah that they're
sw04108-A_016862-017010 yeah
sw04108-A_017010-017168 right
sw04108-A_017168-017382 an[d]- know what they're doing with that
sw04108-A_017624-018589 yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it [noise]
sw04108-A_018589-019154 and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet
sw04108-A_019154-019699 but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
sw04108-A_019699-020558 and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her
sw04108-A_020558-020799 and being a burden she's very independent
sw04108-A_020799-021112 so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country
sw04108-A_021112-021553 and um she really enjoys it right now
sw04108-A_021553-021974 [noise] because she doesn't have to wash dishes or [laughter-cook]
sw04108-A_021974-022174 uh-huh
sw04108-A_022347-022999 right some support and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
sw04108-A_022999-023138 and
sw04108-A_023138-023705 what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
sw04108-A_023705-024020 and then so if she ever does become ill
sw04108-A_024020-024323 um it'll be like family around her
sw04108-A_024323-024453 yeah
sw04108-A_024847-024955 um-hum
sw04108-A_024955-025152 yeah sh[e]-
sw04108-A_025253-025373 um-hum
sw04108-A_025373-025867 no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels
sw04108-A_025867-026813 and um it's in in Missouri in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh [noise] i- i hope that i have something like that
sw04108-A_026813-026966 when i get older
sw04108-A_028048-028184 um-hum
sw04108-A_028706-028895 oh definitely it's
sw04108-A_029151-029240 um-hum
sw04108-A_029420-029553 right
sw04108-B_000000-000124 [noise] okay
sw04108-B_000703-001143 well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
sw04108-B_001143-001934 uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh
sw04108-B_001934-002692 uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh [noise]
sw04108-B_002692-002969 in and who around
sw04108-B_002969-004254 so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home
sw04108-B_004254-005105 um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness
sw04108-B_005105-005883 sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
sw04108-B_006014-006948 um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them_1 out much faster than what they're really able to
sw04108-B_006948-008035 but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam[ilies]- well the families do not necessarily
sw04108-B_008035-008648 uh know what to do with them_1 and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them_1 in a nursing home
sw04108-B_008648-009194 so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think
sw04108-B_009930-010043 yeah
sw04108-B_011138-011298 that's true
sw04108-B_011901-012839 well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because_1 there it's not economically feasible even to put them_1 in a nursing home
sw04108-B_012839-013514 [noise] so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it
sw04108-B_013514-013668 so
sw04108-B_014322-014781 yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh
sw04108-B_014781-015369 [noise] i know some el[derly]- unfortunately some elderly have to go to or [noise] have
sw04108-B_015369-015854 i guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wander or or um
sw04108-B_015963-016242 confused or have some mental problems
sw04108-B_016242-017250 and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
sw04108-B_017250-017716 yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
sw04108-B_019094-019217 um-hum
sw04108-B_021878-022451 gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
sw04108-B_024260-025053 that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active
sw04108-B_025053-025463 so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place [noise]
sw04108-B_026814-027215 yeah i think i think of the um
sw04108-B_027215-028320 i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in
sw04108-B_028320-028827 and the family that's going to be uh effec[ted]- effected by it [noise]
sw04108-B_028827-029831 [noise] and uh you know sometimes it can those choi[ces]- those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're
sw04109-A_000000-000395 [noise] uh guy uh some of my things i i'd like to have a short work week
sw04109-A_000395-000883 you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau[se]-
sw04109-A_000883-000987 ye[ah]-
sw04109-A_000987-001115 okay
sw04109-A_001242-001737 [noise] okay [noise] so i just press one then right okay ready
sw04109-A_001737-001808 okay
sw04109-A_001808-001899 [noise]
sw04109-A_002729-003662 well right now i'm i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force before and
sw04109-A_003662-004345 forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it it seems like S[aturday]-
sw04109-A_004345-004786 Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday
sw04109-A_004786-005620 and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job
sw04109-A_005620-006663 and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh
sw04109-A_006663-007800 more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have le[ss]- we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd nee[d]- you know less police force
sw04109-A_008595-009524 it it that's that's that's a that's a possibility one o[f]- one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance
sw04109-A_009524-010103 is that the small businesses can't a[fford]- can't offer us health insurance
sw04109-A_010103-010952 and it it it's too costly and then what i[s]- what is happening is that they're on um
sw04109-A_010952-012311 a policy where they have s[o]- X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and
sw04109-A_012311-012504 and and things like that
sw04109-A_012504-013431 what happen[s]- and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group well what'll what happens then is that
sw04109-A_013431-013861 they cancel because they just can't cancel the [indivigal/individual]
sw04109-A_013861-014336 so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
sw04109-A_014336-014953 so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
sw04109-A_015330-016114 but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job i'm i'm an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i'm
sw04109-A_016114-016883 i'm not a typical student i'm i'm older i'm i'm in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and
sw04109-A_016883-018116 my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
sw04109-A_018116-018777 it's a really really enjoyable for me because_1 i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
sw04109-A_018777-019429 one of the things that i- i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know wanna
sw04109-A_019557-020265 yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i- i just really can't deal with that so
sw04109-A_020265-020600 what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
sw04109-A_021017-021179 uh-huh
sw04109-A_024390-025098 yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know whe[n]- when you work at a company
sw04109-A_025098-026487 whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist
sw04109-A_026487-027823 but if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so
sw04109-A_027823-028636 that's where i'm tha[t]- i'm i like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in in any o[ne]- one of these jobs and anything i've done
sw04109-A_028636-029500 is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway
sw04109-A_029699-029816 but what i
sw04109-A_029816-029863 [vocalized-noise]
sw04109-B_000378-000528 oh okay
sw04109-B_000746-001495 okay we can start off there let's just get started i don't wanna we[ll]- you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it [laughter]
sw04109-B_001495-001646 right
sw04109-B_001646-001797 yep
sw04109-B_001962-002764 so so you think uh i- i think [vocalized-noise] a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about_1 you
sw04109-B_003384-003524 uh-huh
sw04109-B_004839-004958 [vocalized-noise] uh-huh
sw04109-B_005607-005747 right
sw04109-B_007794-008711 yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that
sw04109-B_008937-009073 yeah
sw04109-B_010085-010245 uh-huh
sw04109-B_012849-012976 right
sw04109-B_014302-014440 um-hum
sw04109-B_014928-015052 right
sw04109-B_015236-015362 so
sw04109-B_015844-015972 right
sw04109-B_016543-016665 yeah
sw04109-B_017847-017968 right
sw04109-B_018740-018870 [laughter]
sw04109-B_020217-020416 yeah uh
sw04109-B_020541-021124 well i do wor[k]- uh research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so
sw04109-B_021124-021257 uh
sw04109-B_021257-021733 i my job has most of the benefits i want um
sw04109-B_021733-022608 what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like but uh
sw04109-B_022608-023245 you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
sw04109-B_023245-023655 uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh
sw04109-B_023655-024448 they pay for continuing education like i- i get night courses that they're they'll cover right now and that's really good
sw04109-B_024448-024568 yeah
sw04109-B_024799-024925 right
sw04109-B_027553-027714 yeah

sw04110-A_000150-000680 [laughter] lately they haven't been much but as a child i used to
sw04110-A_000680-001737 go camping a lot with my my parents we would uh we lived in Mississippi then and we'd go out and camp for the weekend and fish an[d]-
sw04110-A_001737-002428 but we camped like in tents not in uh [laughter] the mobile home or the
sw04110-A_002428-003008 right [laughter] that's what i consider really camping [laughter]
sw04110-A_003456-003593 uh-huh
sw04110-A_004617-004928 got familiar with that lake [laughter]
sw04110-A_005316-005449 uh-huh
sw04110-A_007412-007653 they are uh-huh
sw04110-A_009100-009344 oh that's neat [noise]
sw04110-A_010634-011302 yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh
sw04110-A_011302-011521 my husband races cars
sw04110-A_011521-012793 and in fact we come to Atlanta for about ten days every year and [laughter-and] that's part of my camping experience is we camp out there a little bit sleep in our van or [laughter] what have you for a few nights and um
sw04110-A_012793-013182 kind of cook out of it and what have you but
sw04110-A_014716-014898 oh sounds nice
sw04110-A_015716-015888 um-hum
sw04110-A_018841-020150 yeah well well whenever i mention camping anymore to my husband he says i'm too old for [laughter-this] [laughter] he says i- i like my luxuries anymore but i think i'd still like to you know do a little camping that
sw04110-A_020150-020775 like i say i it brings back memories of my real young years and uh
sw04110-A_020775-021502 he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping [laughter-anyway] true camping
sw04110-A_021944-022087 i bet
sw04110-A_022980-023992 uh-huh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you can't really depend on your weather [laughter]
sw04110-A_024630-024756 um-hum
sw04110-A_024966-026139 and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then we've been coming about a week or so too early [laughter] but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping
sw04110-A_026139-026489 [laughter]
sw04110-A_026489-026798 have they oh well that is really nice
sw04110-A_026903-027650 well i'm sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get take time to
sw04110-A_027650-027887 go out and enjoy them_1 um
sw04110-A_027887-028216 in the spring when the bluebonnets
sw04110-A_028216-028910 are pretty here i think that's our biggest deal there's just fields of bluebonnets and
sw04110-A_028910-029398 what we call Indian paint brushes it's it's really nice
sw04110-A_029700-029885 mostly [laughter-nothing]
sw04110-B_000000-000261 [noise] so uh what are your camping experiences like
sw04110-B_000936-001057 uh-huh
sw04110-B_002246-002558 oh yeah you roughed it [laughter]
sw04110-B_002558-002666 ba[sically]-
sw04110-B_002769-004051 yeah i the only really camping experiences uh i've had i guess was probably with the Cub Scouts or the Boy Scouts when uh i was younger uh we use[d]- i remember one time we went to uh
sw04110-B_004051-004674 uh there's a lake called Lake Lanier here in Georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of
sw04110-B_004776-005904 yeah we s[etup]- we set up all our you know we we canoed out to some island and uh that was a lot of fun set up because_1 we were all we were isolated from everyone else but um
sw04110-B_005904-006124 that's pretty much
sw04110-B_006124-007179 i haven't been [vocalized-noise] lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh
sw04110-B_007179-007637 uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones
sw04110-B_007637-008821 so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a
sw04110-B_008821-009767 northern Alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some r[opes]- ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and
sw04110-B_009767-010708 climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day affair it's not a [overnighter/overnight] type thing but i'd like to i'd like to really get into that kind of thing
sw04110-B_011453-011586 uh-huh
sw04110-B_011845-011988 oh yeah
sw04110-B_012114-012251 [laughter]
sw04110-B_012437-012596 yeah
sw04110-B_012810-012937 [vocalized-noise]
sw04110-B_013143-013544 the last the last true camping experience i had is when uh
sw04110-B_013544-014564 i drove across country with a friend of mine he li[ves]- he goes to school out in California and we drove his car out there and uh we drove you know we took kind of a scenic route we went through uh
sw04110-B_014564-014846 uh the Grand Canyon and
sw04110-B_014846-016085 and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it go[t]- it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
sw04110-B_016085-016839 was just small enough so that it didn't act[ually]- cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the [laughter] for uh
sw04110-B_016839-017521 you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and
sw04110-B_017521-018681 got in the car and uh drove on we were on a kind of a sch[edule]- tight schedule anyway so we couldn't stay too long but we drove on that morning to uh Las Vegas so [laughter] i think that was probably my last uh
sw04110-B_018681-018941 true camping experience
sw04110-B_019416-019585 [laughter]
sw04110-B_020161-020297 yeah
sw04110-B_021091-021239 [laughter]
sw04110-B_021410-022005 well this time of year [vocalized-noise] it's gets really beautiful down the springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and
sw04110-B_022005-022195 there's all kinds of
sw04110-B_022195-022978 it's rea[l]- north there's really some real beautiful spots to to hike and stuff in north Georgia you know up in the kind of getting up the mountainous
sw04110-B_022978-023184 you know the the
sw04110-B_023410-023628 yeah it sure is
sw04110-B_023771-024979 that's true like today it's it's pouring it it takes the leaves around here i mean it's beautiful when they uh when they change it it seems like it happens so fast that if you don't get there at the right time you're gonna miss everything
sw04110-B_025494-025659 yeah
sw04110-B_025876-026030 they're getting
sw04110-B_026030-026605 they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom
sw04110-B_028537-028683 um-hum
sw04110-B_028823-028982 that'd be nice
sw04110-B_029236-029745 i haven't been through that part of the country so i don't really know what i don't really know what it's like over there
sw04111-A_000000-000650 live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state and uh
sw04111-A_000650-001615 it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment uh and
sw04111-A_001615-002307 i feel that it's barbaric actually it seems out of date with civilization as
sw04111-A_002519-003449 i think so because i think what we're talking about is is uh life making and life taking decisions and i i don't think any
sw04111-A_003449-004207 one human being has the right to take away the life of any other human being not that it's a a religious feeling or anything like that
sw04111-A_004207-004673 but it seems hypocritical to me that we'd say in the case of murder for instance that
sw04111-A_004673-005624 uh because you took away somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong we are going to take away your life i don't see that that makes any sense really
sw04111-A_007288-007997 i don't think it's a matter of the of the murderer's rights i think it's a matter of our uh
sw04111-A_007997-009346 penal people's rights and i don't think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment uh to deter other people from
sw04111-A_009346-010235 doing such heinous crimes uh for instance i think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody who commits any murder of any sort
sw04111-A_010235-011379 and i also think that uh other things that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as putting prisoners to work and making them earn their their pay
sw04111-A_011379-011813 but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative
sw04111-A_011813-012947 to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're
sw04111-A_012947-014241 uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldn't change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i don't see it as much of a deterrent either
sw04111-A_016123-016744 yeah and i think that's unfortunate that is probably the way it is today and i think that ought to be changed uh
sw04111-A_016744-017929 i think like i said i think people ought to be made to pay for their stay and not make it pleasant for them i think hard labor should be required even among people that a[re]- a[re]- are not able
sw04111-A_017929-019029 to perform hard labor you know if th[ey]- if they died naturally from working then i guess that would be okay because that wouldn't be uh putting anybody to death forcibly
sw04111-A_019029-019989 but uh i i can't see i can't see executing people it just seems so barbar[ous]- barbaric in these times
sw04111-A_020708-021099 in California i i thought there was but i could be wrong
sw04111-A_021099-021687 what amazes me is how many people speak out in favor of capital punishment even here in New York
sw04111-A_021687-022830 people really want to see it uh be put into effect it seems more so than those of us who feel the way i feel uh uh at least are vocal
sw04111-A_022830-023524 saying that no they want things to stay the way they are lot of people want to see capital punishment made legal
sw04111-A_023723-023992 okay um
sw04111-A_023992-024994 i guess uh i guess we did what we have to do and i don't see any instructions as far as doing anything else so i uh it's nice talking with you
sw04111-A_024994-025247 okay take care bye
sw04111-A_025247-025539 [noise]
sw04111-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04111-B_002176-002554 really even if the the crime is extremely extremely serious
sw04111-B_005557-006204 well it's not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals
sw04111-B_006204-006797 so if some person just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people
sw04111-B_006797-007299 does he really have the right to [vocalized-noise] continue living and be a burden on society
sw04111-B_011109-011483 yeah i agree with that part yeah def[initely]-
sw04111-B_014204-015204 well some criminals would see it a[s]- a life in jail doesn't particularly sound too harsh to someone who's been living on the street you know for all his life and then
sw04111-B_015204-015872 uh jail jail time would seem like uh you know a break or a a paid
sw04111-B_015872-016152 paid sustenance for the rest of his life
sw04111-B_017113-017277 yeah
sw04111-B_017277-017630 make it make it harsh as possible
sw04111-B_018870-018990 yeah
sw04111-B_019998-020333 uh well i live in California i'm not really up on it i
sw04111-B_020333-020608 i think we don't have capital punishment either
sw04111-B_020608-020767 huh-uh
sw04111-B_020767-020923 yeah
sw04111-B_022149-022275 well

sw04112-A_009769-009866 uh-huh
sw04112-A_010467-010840 well that's a good idea i had never thought about it that way
sw04112-A_012952-013073 um-hum
sw04112-A_013451-013570 yeah
sw04112-A_013570-013690 right
sw04112-A_013690-013855 right that's
sw04112-A_013855-014186 that would be a wonderful idea

sw04112-A_015318-015428 um
sw04112-A_015895-015995 righ[t]-

sw04112-A_023600-023685 {yipes}
sw04112-A_023971-024090 um-hum
sw04112-A_024090-024227 right
sw04112-A_024585-025843 oh i'm i'm just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh i'm not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and uh
sw04112-A_025843-026093 i haven't gotten them_1 yet i'm going in a few
sw04112-A_026093-026248 um
sw04112-A_026248-026404 and i- i
sw04112-A_026404-026958 i'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh
sw04112-A_026958-027355 if research for a school would be something i would consider
sw04112-A_027647-028167 oh oh it's the Georgia Tech Research Institute it's affiliated with the university um
sw04112-A_028167-028831 and uh we do research uh the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas
sw04112-A_028831-029242 and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government
sw04112-A_029242-029768 so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government
sw04112-A_029768-029891 so
sw04112-B_000000-000147 [noise] right now i'm at um
sw04112-B_000147-000453 University of Pennsylvania i'm a graduate student
sw04112-B_000453-000907 and the benefits that i get are very minimal
sw04112-B_000907-001661 but i do get my health insurance paid for but i don't have any kind of disability insurance or um
sw04112-B_001661-002341 let's see no disability insurance no va[cation]- well i ge[t]- in a way i get vacation pay because i get to se[t]- totally set my own schedule
sw04112-B_002341-002504 but
sw04112-B_002504-002999 not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal
sw04112-B_003381-003510 uh-huh
sw04112-B_004150-004463 you're undergraduate student or graduate student
sw04112-B_004463-004629 undergrad yeah
sw04112-B_004629-004950 yeah here they for the grad students at least
sw04112-B_004950-005998 in physiology department which my de[gree]- degree granting department is bio[logical]- engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesn't even do that
sw04112-B_005998-006985 but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now
sw04112-B_006985-008010 so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had
sw04112-B_008010-008375 everybody responsible for their own health insurance
sw04112-B_008375-008689 and either that or wh[at]-
sw04112-B_008689-009331 they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income
sw04112-B_009331-010525 so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else
sw04112-B_010857-011056 so
sw04112-B_011056-011171 i guess
sw04112-B_011171-011494 i would like to see something like that and then
sw04112-B_011494-012059 i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having
sw04112-B_012059-012509 instead of um a national health insurance system having
sw04112-B_012509-013626 a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick
sw04112-B_014156-014757 but on the other hand i[n]- in the curr[ent]- state of the current system i'll
sw04112-B_014757-015119 whenever i get out of here i'll look for
sw04112-B_015119-015427 a job probably an academic job that would
sw04112-B_015640-016429 you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan
sw04112-B_016429-017226 which is a it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to
sw04112-B_017226-017440 and
sw04112-B_017605-018617 a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking [noise] good care of you
sw04112-B_018617-018923 i know my daddy worked for the federal government
sw04112-B_018923-020006 and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he w[ent]- taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the
sw04112-B_020006-021154 federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isn't particularly well
sw04112-B_021154-021706 she has um she's a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that
sw04112-B_021706-022639 now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs Lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture
sw04112-B_022639-023151 and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month [laughter]
sw04112-B_023151-024145 so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get
sw04112-B_024250-024596 what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out
sw04112-B_026119-026198 um-hum
sw04112-B_026912-027038 uh-huh
sw04112-B_027038-027424 [noise] hum
sw04112-B_027424-027681 what kind of company are you working with {co-oping}
sw04112-B_028096-028220 i see
sw04112-B_029227-029328 uh-huh
sw04112-B_029749-029848 right
sw04113-A_000000-000087 um
sw04113-A_000087-000450 so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
sw04113-A_001374-001495 uh-huh
sw04113-A_001659-001751 uh-huh
sw04113-A_001871-002661 i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
sw04113-A_003191-003291 um-hum
sw04113-A_004252-004378 um-hum
sw04113-A_004844-004947 um
sw04113-A_005143-005255 yeah
sw04113-A_005480-005550 um-hum
sw04113-A_006317-006445 uh-huh
sw04113-A_006595-006686 uh-huh
sw04113-A_006686-007171 uh the the only prob[lem]- the only problem i see with term limitations um
sw04113-A_007171-007382 is that i think that
sw04113-A_007382-008341 the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar[ge]- you know there there is a learning curve
sw04113-A_008341-008989 and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective
sw04113-A_008989-009189 uh Congress person
sw04113-A_009289-009774 uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
sw04113-A_010419-010550 uh-huh
sw04113-A_011050-011178 yeah but
sw04113-A_011467-011585 uh
sw04113-A_011932-012055 um-hum
sw04113-A_013766-013869 um-hum
sw04113-A_014496-014627 yeah
sw04113-A_014627-014904 uh the other the other thing that that
sw04113-A_014904-015502 uh bothers me about our system is just that um
sw04113-A_015502-015729 in for for
sw04113-A_015729-016256 in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has
sw04113-A_016256-017570 is based on their seniority and how long they've been there so it's you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well
sw04113-A_017570-018599 we're going to just we're [vocalized-noise] i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
sw04113-A_019260-019385 uh-huh
sw04113-A_020936-021070 uh-huh [laughter]
sw04113-A_021346-021474 uh-huh
sw04113-A_021833-021951 uh-huh
sw04113-A_022988-023073 uh
sw04113-A_023782-023895 yeah
sw04113-A_024333-024384 uh-huh
sw04113-A_024566-025484 well i mean [vocalized-noise] i don't see why it makes a big difference the CIA because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative
sw04113-A_025637-025757 uh-huh
sw04113-A_027897-028022 uh-huh
sw04113-A_029239-029350 uh
sw04113-A_029350-029500 um-hum
sw04113-B_000000-000044 [noise]
sw04113-B_000442-001879 generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean
sw04113-B_002677-003790 i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too
sw04113-B_003790-004450 i know some senators and i don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and
sw04113-B_004450-005553 i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year
sw04113-B_005553-006510 which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less
sw04113-B_006510-006705 you know less than i do [laughter]
sw04113-B_009800-010466 i think i think that's true however i think that's always been true
sw04113-B_010466-011088 i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover every eight years or four years
sw04113-B_011088-011981 and uh they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short
sw04113-B_011981-013223 i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman
sw04113-B_013223-014696 uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't you we aren't having a massive ballot every four years
sw04113-B_018569-020021 uh-huh i think i think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the C i A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for
sw04113-B_020021-021032 a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isn't in West Virginia i hate to tell the s[enator]- the senator from West Virginia this information but
sw04113-B_021032-022404 it really doesn't [vocalized-noise] uh the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and
sw04113-B_022404-023777 the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive
sw04113-B_023777-024754 and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I i don't remember but i think there's
sw04113-B_025520-025716 yeah that's officially
sw04113-B_025716-026860 i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh
sw04113-B_026860-027964 turn[over]- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
sw04113-B_027964-028811 but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago
sw04113-B_028811-029962 uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
sw04114-A_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04114-A_000033-000239 so how you like New Jersey
sw04114-A_001371-001933 right i guess uh i don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
sw04114-A_002282-002449 right uh-huh
sw04114-A_002864-003001 yeah
sw04114-A_003001-003094 yeah
sw04114-A_003194-003290 right
sw04114-A_003290-003463 [laughter]
sw04114-A_003950-004080 right
sw04114-A_004080-005369 well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
sw04114-A_005369-005512 yeah
sw04114-A_006263-007563 that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that
sw04114-A_007836-008055 yeah and it's like
sw04114-A_008158-008289 sure
sw04114-A_008561-009548 right i guess from what i hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California
sw04114-A_009969-010095 yeah
sw04114-A_010357-010692 right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick
sw04114-A_010692-010742 [laughter]
sw04114-A_010742-011957 uh i was reading a an article in Time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh
sw04114-A_011957-012591 it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the CFC's but
sw04114-A_012706-012955 uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely
sw04114-A_013136-013252 right
sw04114-A_013611-013703 right
sw04114-A_013991-014487 yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries
sw04114-A_014487-015217 because i guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating CFC production but
sw04114-A_015217-015315 it
sw04114-A_015315-015414 go ahead
sw04114-A_016095-016228 um-hum
sw04114-A_017203-017992 right and that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
sw04114-A_017992-018075 [laughter]
sw04114-A_018075-018428 if if that makes any sense uh in terms of
sw04114-A_018714-019349 exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh
sw04114-A_019349-019878 i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize
sw04114-A_019878-020677 those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles
sw04114-A_020677-021393 and it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places
sw04114-A_021393-021644 so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not
sw04114-A_021644-021670 [laughter]
sw04114-A_021670-021903 not a real good one actually but
sw04114-A_022291-022363 yeah
sw04114-A_022601-022725 uh-huh
sw04114-A_022725-022849 yeah
sw04114-A_022849-023498 yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time
sw04114-A_024034-024599 okay so you've got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think
sw04114-A_025252-025550 yeah Denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst
sw04114-A_025801-025933 sure
sw04114-A_025933-026449 yeah Denver's that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley
sw04114-A_026449-027089 kind of like Mexico City does i guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in in the world for that
sw04114-A_027089-028083 but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and
sw04114-A_028083-029004 there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can
sw04114-A_029147-029304 exactly
sw04114-A_029304-029952 yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but it's kind of it's
sw04114-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04114-B_000275-000524 uh it's pretty good you know you get uh
sw04114-B_000524-001448 closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
sw04114-B_001891-002365 [noise] yeah it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial
sw04114-B_002365-003388 but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists actually very
sw04114-B_003388-004020 yeah you you go even a few wi[de]- miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
sw04114-B_004020-004165 but uh
sw04114-B_005290-005901 oh de[finitely]- definitely it's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road they're all
sw04114-B_005901-006354 yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
sw04114-B_007489-007900 oh e[ven]- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year
sw04114-B_007900-008599 you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
sw04114-B_009487-010030 yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets
sw04114-B_010030-010448 so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline
sw04114-B_012497-012726 it it is coming from cars though
sw04114-B_012943-014044 i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluor[ocarbons]- [chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons] -[chloro]fluorocarbons
sw04114-B_015124-015348 well it it
sw04114-B_015348-016170 no it's the type of thing there that uh you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial
sw04114-B_016170-016820 so they're on the different part of the cycle of the US the US used you know all the air pollution stuff
sw04114-B_016820-017301 and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
sw04114-B_018304-018875 or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to
sw04114-B_021353-021448 yeah
sw04114-B_021748-022301 no well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction
sw04114-B_022301-022712 which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and
sw04114-B_022712-022918 replacing some of the pollutants
sw04114-B_023499-024099 mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta Washington DC area
sw04114-B_024099-024196 [vocalized-noise]
sw04114-B_024551-025908 well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the with the inversion and Los Angeles and a[ll]- rest of California which is just terrible it sounds
sw04114-B_026598-026703 uh-huh
sw04114-B_026961-027095 yeah
sw04114-B_028880-029457 yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of uh heavy industry you know that would be causing it
sw04114-B_029754-029852 um-hum
sw04115-A_000000-000314 it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high
sw04115-A_000771-001703 it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn't seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar
sw04115-A_003753-003854 uh-huh
sw04115-A_003854-004339 yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high
sw04115-A_005261-005378 uh-huh
sw04115-A_006253-006400 oh boy
sw04115-A_008668-008905 yeah that does make it difficult
sw04115-A_009384-009794 uh well i used to work in finance but i i don't any longer
sw04115-A_009927-011071 i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours
sw04115-A_011071-011522 but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question
sw04115-A_012057-012170 uh-huh
sw04115-A_013002-013110 right
sw04115-A_013314-013492 right that's what's irritating
sw04115-A_013603-013941 [noise] it's also irritating that
sw04115-A_013941-014868 you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how [noise] how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem to hear that that it changes or improves

sw04115-A_027235-027341 [laughter] yeah
sw04115-A_027527-027893 course in Texas at least you still don't have income tax

sw04115-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04115-B_000368-000754 well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar
sw04115-B_001655-002070 we don't uh we it there's there's too much um
sw04115-B_002070-002200 uh
sw04115-B_002200-003023 pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
sw04115-B_003023-003798 do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the TV
sw04115-B_003798-003883 you know
sw04115-B_003883-004011 but i
sw04115-B_004308-005287 right that uh i just i just pay you you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property

sw04115-B_005758-006341 and if i could get what they're charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute
sw04115-B_006341-006658 you know so that that's why i just don't uh
sw04115-B_006658-006985 there's a lot of you know a lot of expense
sw04115-B_006985-007712 as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldn't be spending our money on

sw04115-B_011437-012113 right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax m[oney]- the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that
sw04115-B_012113-012220 but it
sw04115-B_012220-012673 you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh
sw04115-B_012673-013126 and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that
sw04115-B_013126-013307 that's a that's a bigger
sw04115-B_013424-013719 problem to me than than having to pay them
sw04115-B_014840-014956 right
sw04115-B_014956-016124 well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our
sw04115-B_016124-016707 Federal Government is our uh why in the world they don't get rid of
sw04115-B_016707-018201 one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the Congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because that's costing that's costing the taxpayer m[ultimillions]- multimillions
sw04115-B_018201-019265 and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um
sw04115-B_019265-020727 i don't i've never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the United States that only has one housing i meant one governing body
sw04115-B_020876-021504 okay there is there's one state i've i in fac[t]- i don't know whether it's New Hampshire it's a northern state
sw04115-B_021504-021649 um
sw04115-B_021649-022390 or New England state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um
sw04115-B_022390-022733 you know they their taxes are are
sw04115-B_022733-022973 more well spent
sw04115-B_022973-023695 but uh no i've you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i can't change
sw04115-B_023695-023883 but uh
sw04115-B_023883-024220 what s[tate]- what part of the country are you from
sw04115-B_024494-024614 okay
sw04115-B_024614-024761 i'm course i'm
sw04115-B_024761-025835 i'm from Texas too but um i think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here
sw04115-B_025835-025956 so
sw04115-B_025956-026644 i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh Benedict County and i live in Smith County
sw04115-B_026810-026926 Texas
sw04115-B_026926-027198 still in Texas you hear this Texas accent
sw04115-B_027198-027330 [laughter]
sw04115-B_027330-027607 i can't get rid of it [laughter]
sw04115-B_027875-028145 well i think we pay it in other ways
sw04115-B_028295-029607 i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways it's funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tigh[ter]- higher tax rate for a single person
sw04115-B_029607-029872 than they do for a married couple
sw04116-A_000481-001868 this is for everybo[dy]- for for private and commercial sector uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that you if you gonna take a job
sw04116-A_001868-002150 you know and then they say well we're we're gonna
sw04116-A_002150-003413 we're gonna test you you know periodically or something like this because the job is of the security nature or for the you know and the public safety or something that's might be one thing but i really believe that the employee
sw04116-A_003413-004057 [noise] should have the right of of before he takes a job of making that decision there's just uh
sw04116-A_004057-005019 there's too many false positives and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have
sw04116-A_005019-005219 a
sw04116-A_005219-006116 a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here
sw04116-A_006116-007476 you have to go an[d]- and here you go pee in the bottle an[d]- and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if i[f]- if if i[f]- if it what happens this time and they they just [noise] that the testing p[art]- part of it is just really bad
sw04116-A_008084-008704 [noise] yeah they are they are th[ey]- it's [noise] one of the reason is because of the cost
sw04116-A_008704-010086 and when you have such a magnitude of people and you have a company and you're trying to [noise] you're trying to stay afloat and you're you're you're you're having to get these tests and these tests are very expensive so what happens is that
sw04116-A_010086-010907 sometimes you get so you're getting through a a testing company th[at's]- that's we would might say just for
sw04116-A_010907-011229 terms is f[ly]- a fly by night company something like
sw04116-B_000000-000591 hi [laughter] [vocalized-noise] this is drug testing for government employees only or was it for everybody
sw04116-B_007400-008149 is i didn't i didn't really i don't really know much about this are i didn't realize that false positives were such a risk
sw04116-B_008708-008865 uh-huh
sw04117-A_000000-001003 [noise] oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because
sw04117-A_001003-001909 i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the
sw04117-A_001909-002880 belief that uh any particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some
sw04117-A_002880-003638 very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway
sw04117-A_003638-004042 so uh i just i i'm just basically against it
sw04117-A_004042-004868 uh [laughter] i also i also don't have enough faith in our [noise] our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while
sw04117-A_005511-005649 [laughter]
sw04117-A_012851-013249 uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that
sw04117-A_014446-014649 yeah do you i
sw04117-A_014817-014941 yeah
sw04117-A_015856-017133 yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh there are there are some other things i'm a[gainst]- i'm against also i thi[nk]- i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against
sw04117-A_017133-017804 so and so so i'm sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have [laughter] ei[ther]- either you execute them_1
sw04117-A_017804-018464 and uh you're done with it or you know you throw them_1 you throw them_1 in jail for some incredibly long period of time
sw04117-A_018464-019465 and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them_1 in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh o[ther]- other cell mates you know
sw04117-A_019465-019821 so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you
sw04117-A_019821-020167 got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but
sw04117-A_020167-021203 you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh [laughter] it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment
sw04117-A_021203-022510 um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably haven't really signed up to the idea of you know our co[ncept]- i mean most western people's concept of civilization you know
sw04117-A_022510-023084 and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um
sw04117-A_023084-023857 but [noise] you know i i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to
sw04117-A_023857-024664 to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because_1 i think there are probably a lot of instances where um
sw04117-A_024664-025468 you get into a situation where somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something
sw04117-A_025468-026233 and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh
sw04117-A_026233-026982 some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know [laughter] and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society
sw04117-A_026982-028211 and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or
sw04117-A_028211-028844 you know killing a cop who's trying to get him to you know come in to pay his [vocalized-noise] there's a million there's a million things
sw04117-A_028844-029895 you know that i can ima[gine]- million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know
sw04117-B_000000-000057 [noise]
sw04117-B_003558-003699 um-hum
sw04117-B_003950-004299 [laughter]
sw04117-B_004764-005828 [laughter-well] that's probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually i'm i'm in favor of it um [laughter-well] this ought to be an interesting discussion uh [laughter] um
sw04117-B_005828-007147 i my basic reason is that uh if someone uh willfully takes a life of another individual um i think that they have in most cases forfeited um their
sw04117-B_007147-008197 convention by which they agree to abide to when when they enter into society um you know they have there's a a convention that you know you shall not kill other individuals
sw04117-B_008197-009203 um and if you can kill with impunity um then that kind of makes you king of the hill in a society that that can't control you
sw04117-B_009203-010052 uh and if you've shown that that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals that that you kill uh cold-bloodedly or whatever
sw04117-B_010052-010688 then uh it's probably uh a good thing to remove remove you from that society
sw04117-B_010688-011572 um and one probably one of the more effective ways of of doing that is through the death penalty uh because_1 it's a highly visible sort of action um
sw04117-B_011572-012475 and it also sends a message that you know this this sort of behavior is not tolerable within the society and you will forfeit all your rights
sw04117-B_012475-012899 uh if you engage in such activity
sw04117-B_012899-013033 so
sw04117-B_013272-014480 well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden
sw04117-B_014480-015979 uh because_1 they'd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible uh because_1 they're rotting away in a jail uh and the taxpayers are paying you know for them to sit there and twiddle away and and make license plates or something [laughter]
sw04117-B_017041-017310 [laughter-well] yeah
sw04117-B_017543-017739 [laughter]
sw04117-B_019405-019533 um-hum
sw04117-B_019752-019906 [laughter]
sw04117-B_020794-021097 right right [laughter]
sw04117-B_021097-021337 exactly exactly
sw04117-B_022410-022550 um-hum
sw04117-B_022910-023050 okay_1
sw04117-B_025504-025674 how so uh
sw04117-B_026598-026726 [laughter]
sw04117-B_026922-027060 um-hum
sw04117-B_028794-028952 [laughter]
sw04118-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04118-A_000027-000497 um i don't know um does your do you have recycling in Atlanta
sw04118-A_002292-002747 uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you
sw04118-A_004248-004444 um-hum into the different box
sw04118-A_004444-005485 yeah [vocalized-noise] up here like New Hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's
sw04118-A_005485-005611 that's not real
sw04118-A_005611-006011 that's not real popular with the states around us because
sw04118-A_006011-007127 the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles ev[erybody]- everybody comes across the border [laughter] to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
sw04118-A_007127-007228 but
sw04118-A_007228-008492 i- i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more
sw04118-A_008492-008648 and i
sw04118-A_008648-008954 there's a big problem here with like landfills
sw04118-A_008954-009111 uh like
sw04118-A_009111-009568 they the the landfills are j[ust]- are just like filling up with stuff
sw04118-A_009568-010683 and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it becau[se]- just so that we could save the space in those things
sw04118-A_013895-014133 yeah [laughter]
sw04118-A_014446-014584 i i was
sw04118-A_014584-015548 i- i don't know when i was in when i- i was [vocalized-noise] last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made
sw04118-A_015548-016850 let's see he made he made a lot of money working be[cause]- because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
sw04118-A_016955-017620 that's where it's like every ev[ery]- every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it
sw04118-A_017620-018378 and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it
sw04118-A_018378-019289 but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
sw04118-A_019289-019582 the law says that if they sell they have to collect
sw04118-A_019582-020384 but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh
sw04118-A_020384-020503 he
sw04118-A_020503-021076 he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor
sw04118-A_021076-021633 collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
sw04118-A_021633-022267 they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot
sw04118-A_022267-022899 and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you s[aid]- like you were saying
sw04118-A_022899-024164 they they lost like big money on because they can't rec[ycle]- they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be [remelded/remolded] remolded or mel[ted]- melted into into other things
sw04118-A_024164-024544 and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
sw04118-A_024544-024887 but i don't know i i wonder you know shou[ld]-
sw04118-A_024887-025281 should they be making things that like just can't be reused
sw04118-A_025281-025425 uh
sw04118-A_025425-025741 it kind of i- i don't i don't and well
sw04118-A_025741-026057 should i be buying things that can't be reused
sw04118-A_027527-027611 i
sw04118-A_028143-028207 yeah well you know [noise] i- i can't something i can't figure out is it
sw04118-A_028207-028907 do you ev[ery]- d[o]- you ev[ery]- did you ever see those big old Coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
sw04118-A_028907-029249 at at what point in time did it get to be
sw04118-A_029249-029856 at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
sw04118-B_000000-000042 [noise]
sw04118-B_000500-001677 uh yeah i see [noise] seen some uh there's some trucks that come around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big containers on them and they'll go and uh
sw04118-B_001677-002259 and collect collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do
sw04118-B_002704-003668 well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh
sw04118-B_003668-004299 in your home and then put it out on the curb and the[y]- and they just throw the matching color uh
sw04118-B_004299-004496 container yeah yeah
sw04118-B_005436-005550 uh-huh
sw04118-B_005868-005982 yeah
sw04118-B_006960-007052 yeah
sw04118-B_007052-007151 yeah
sw04118-B_008422-008535 yeah
sw04118-B_008893-008992 yeah
sw04118-B_009535-009641 uh-huh
sw04118-B_010599-010731 yeah
sw04118-B_010731-011932 well uh it's kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting station down here and uh they were talking about recycling and
sw04118-B_011932-012356 they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but
sw04118-B_012356-013304 they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that uh was at a recycling center but it was costing them uh
sw04118-B_013304-013939 about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it
sw04118-B_013939-014487 so [laughter] so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them
sw04118-B_014487-014590 and uh
sw04118-B_016829-017009 i'm not sure i
sw04118-B_017571-017675 oh
sw04118-B_018129-018232 um-hum
sw04118-B_018951-019049 yeah
sw04118-B_019208-019286 yeah
sw04118-B_019524-019630 yeah
sw04118-B_020356-020432 um-hum
sw04118-B_021054-021133 uh
sw04118-B_021590-021678 uh-huh
sw04118-B_022216-022332 right
sw04118-B_024115-024229 uh-huh
sw04118-B_024496-024582 yeah
sw04118-B_025240-025349 yeah
sw04118-B_026012-026141 yeah
sw04118-B_026141-026339 yeah it's uh
sw04118-B_026339-026464 uh
sw04118-B_026579-026964 something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying
sw04118-B_026964-027505 everything is you know if it's not convenient people don't want it
sw04118-B_027505-027818 and usually convenience means waste [laughter]
sw04118-B_028709-028837 yeah
sw04118-B_028837-028957 yeah
sw04118-B_029534-029625 yeah
sw04119-A_000000-001312 [noise] so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost
sw04119-A_001312-001701 you know there there's a there's a there's a trade off of our civil rights
sw04119-A_001701-002277 against i guess our employer's right to to having a good job or something
sw04119-A_003104-003288 um-hum
sw04119-A_008601-009599 yeah uh well tha[t's]- that's a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isn't this isn't exactly disagreement wi[th]-
sw04119-A_009599-010117 i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people
sw04119-A_010117-011347 but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on
sw04119-A_012089-013184 well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they['re]- they're going to get caught um having drugs that
sw04119-A_013184-014517 that tha[t]- that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because_1 he might be coming in any minute you know
sw04119-A_016767-016952 um-hum
sw04119-A_019906-020785 well the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was
sw04119-A_020785-022083 taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um
sw04119-A_022083-023269 in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone
sw04119-A_023269-024355 um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park
sw04119-A_024355-025380 and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the Swiss have they decided to close it down
sw04119-A_025492-026231 so uh i don't know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there aren't going to that there isn't a perfect solution
sw04119-A_027696-028524 that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down
sw04119-A_029313-029637 yes we do we do
sw04119-B_000000-000059 [noise]
sw04119-B_002238-003436 uh i don't don't really see the employers as having a whole lot to do with it i've already it the um privilege of being a victim of random drug testing i spent four years in the Marine Corps and had to pee in a bottle on command
sw04119-B_003436-004642 and it was really a really aggravating and time wasting thing to do um the thing that i really hated most about it was the total waste behind it all they would get maybe
sw04119-B_004642-004982 between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would
sw04119-B_004982-006229 you know we'd lose the whole morning what is that that's a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me
sw04119-B_006229-007526 i wasn't happy with it at all in fact after i got out i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesn't seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate
sw04119-B_007526-008587 um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well
sw04119-B_011210-012188 now that's implying that um as a punitive kind of a thing as well you definitely want to discourage that is that kind of what you're saying
sw04119-B_014369-015677 yeah well i guess that's a good policy then if uh you're definitely for eradicating drugs from society i'm not so certain that that's a a worthwhile goal right now
sw04119-B_015677-017029 it looks like there's a lot of problems with um you know keeping drugs illegal things that are really scary a lot of people are dying and there's a lot of bloodshed and that that disturbs me i live downtown and uh man
sw04119-B_017029-018130 right diagonal across from campus is uh Teakwood Homes it's the oldest housing project in the country Roosevelt opened it and man there's shootings in there nightly and if it wasn't for the uh
sw04119-B_018130-019356 you know the the high profit margin i don't think it would be going on i don't think that uh we'd have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well there's at least one nasty bloody
sw04119-B_019356-019893 violent crime per year um over here where one of the students is a victim
sw04119-B_021905-022037 uh-huh
sw04119-B_024209-024409 is that the park yeah
sw04119-B_025300-025587 [noise] yeah i just saw that in the news here recently
sw04119-B_026206-026734 yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions
sw04119-B_026734-027670 i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment
sw04119-B_028467-028588 yeah
sw04119-B_028588-029321 and it's funny how today in movies and all we really glorify those gangsters and that lifestyle it's kind of spooky
sw04119-B_029479-029863 i gue[ss]- i guess even today in today's movies a lot
sw04120-A_000000-000190 ever um
sw04120-A_000190-000356 hello
sw04120-A_000356-000816 yeah okay so we're started i guess i'll p[ress]- press one again [noise]
sw04120-A_000816-000953 there
sw04120-A_000953-001412 uh i'm surprised it's not telling us that that uh
sw04120-A_001412-002258 we're going but at any rate um had do you have such a program uh where you work
sw04120-A_003542-004304 well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was
sw04120-A_004304-005030 benign i uh really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that uh
sw04120-A_005030-005545 uh you know we we want to stamp out um drug use
sw04120-A_005545-006094 uh and uh the it's certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs
sw04120-A_006094-006262 um
sw04120-A_006262-007260 and i don't really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the se[nse]- because uh drug use is
sw04120-A_007260-007999 uh a dangerous influence on other people in society
sw04120-A_007999-008769 um there wa[s]- i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who um
sw04120-A_008769-009379 were rabidly opposed to it and i i gradually became
sw04120-A_009379-010505 proselytized uh by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there there're couple things one is the is the insult of it
sw04120-A_010505-010768 perhaps as a um
sw04120-A_010768-011381 preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to
sw04120-A_011381-012226 uh employees who are tried and proven uh that they've been asked to do they're gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face
sw04120-A_015195-015566 and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because
sw04120-A_015566-016672 uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled i[n]- in a sense
sw04120-A_016672-017600 to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say [noise] you've got to take a drug test
sw04120-A_017777-018149 uh as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone
sw04120-A_020912-021037 um-hum
sw04120-A_021159-021287 right
sw04120-A_022435-022800 was that on a nee[d]- on a need basis or [laughter]
sw04120-A_023009-023199 oh i see all right
sw04120-A_024967-025927 uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at Texas Instruments was the um
sw04120-A_026066-026494 u[nproductive]- unproductive nature of it that basically uh
sw04120-A_026494-027556 drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government
sw04120-A_027556-028594 uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the the likelihood of finding drug users in the TI population is very very low
sw04120-A_028700-029035 and um and so
sw04120-A_029035-029907 uh people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the the testing uh requirement from the government
sw04120-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04120-B_000296-000417 hello
sw04120-B_000518-000641 um-hum
sw04120-B_001556-001679 okay
sw04120-B_002183-002480 no i don't and uh
sw04120-B_002480-003450 i can't say that i'm unhappy that we don't uh or happy you know either way i guess not being not being involved in it
sw04120-B_003450-003642 uh
sw04120-B_005469-005605 um-hum
sw04120-B_006012-006146 um-hum
sw04120-B_007889-008009 um-hum
sw04120-B_008949-009079 um-hum
sw04120-B_012003-012127 um-hum
sw04120-B_012127-012740 oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in um
sw04120-B_012740-013665 someone who obviously had a problem with it um someone who had um well i won't say behavioral problems but uh
sw04120-B_013665-014690 you know noticeable signs or you know got caught on the job you know uh in that case if they really wanted to help the employee it's sort of an enforced uh
sw04120-B_014690-015337 enforced clean period um but you know
sw04120-B_017566-017744 yeah
sw04120-B_017744-017924 i'd
sw04120-B_018163-019269 that's true that that sort of sing[ling]- singling a person out i guess i could see that side it of it as well well you can see i really haven't given it a whole lot of thought i'm i work for a privately held uh
sw04120-B_019269-019649 uh systems integrator and uh
sw04120-B_019649-020339 we are family oriented as a company and uh we we don't have uh
sw04120-B_020339-021681 any any problems that uh anyone knows about if you know what i mean there may be problems but no one is aware of them so it it's sort of a an invisible thing for us um [noise]
sw04120-B_021681-022594 there's no real requirement for it um [vocalized-noise] i did work for a company where i had to take a psyche profile once but uh that's another story
sw04120-B_022594-023069 no all uh uh um everybody had to take one
sw04120-B_023069-024277 but uh [laughter] thank you very much that's uh that's another that's another matter entirely but yeah i guess uh i guess i would say now now tha[t]- now that uh you've presented that case i would have to say that
sw04120-B_024277-024976 uh random i[f]- if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out
sw04120-B_027518-027651 um-hum
sw04120-B_028537-028738 oh sure you have to be sharp
sw04121-A_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04121-A_000054-000484 well what kind of uh programs do y'all have up there for recycling
sw04121-A_001344-001466 um-hum
sw04121-A_002004-002549 is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or a collection center
sw04121-A_003259-003442 oh okay
sw04121-A_003893-005014 right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics
sw04121-A_005014-005665 um but it's not real convenient like you said for lots of other things um and
sw04121-A_005665-006388 it it is kind of nice though because you can put everything in together and you don't have to sort it out which is nice
sw04121-A_006509-006684 no
sw04121-A_006684-008051 uh you just they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it there's a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is convenient but if you want to recycle anything other than their list you know good luck [laughter]
sw04121-A_008051-009416 um we have a couple of collection places around but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins
sw04121-A_009416-009697 for all the different sorting things you have to do
sw04121-A_011302-011431 right
sw04121-A_011800-012311 well what's kind of interesting is here when the program started they
sw04121-A_012311-013636 made a big deal about it but they only gave it to like five thousand houses which in Atlanta is nothing you know and it was interesting because_1 it was the only reason we got it is because_1 we're sort of on the outskirts of this
sw04121-A_013636-014859 rather plush area so [laughter] you can tell where they put the recycling uh program in place so Atlanta really hasn't spread it out very much at all yet i don't think um i guess
sw04121-A_014859-015088 budgetary restraints
sw04121-A_015304-015585 um no i live off campus
sw04121-A_015585-015787 yeah pretty far off
sw04121-A_015893-016882 right no it's it's the city the s[chool]- Georgia Tech has it's own well has been trying to get it's own recycling program uh uh operated through the student government
sw04121-A_016882-018270 but there they've tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans
sw04121-A_018270-019092 for a living and they're afraid that that's going to attract crime onto campus having a ready supply of cans
sw04121-A_019312-019986 [laughter] no well i don't know wh[at]- wh[at]- you know what their their philosophy was on that
sw04121-A_019986-020916 but uh th[at]- so they it's kind of a crime that we have all these students wanting to do this and n[o]- no cooperation to to get that program going
sw04121-A_020916-021050 but
sw04121-A_021050-022068 a a friend of mine and i had also thought a while back about doing some recycling on our own to make some money and i think it was interesting i found out that glass
sw04121-A_022068-022416 is only worth like a penny a pound
sw04121-A_022416-023468 and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds well that's great but that's a dollar [laughter]
sw04121-A_023468-023941 so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do
sw04121-A_024555-024683 uh-huh
sw04121-A_025322-025448 right
sw04121-A_025763-025894 wow
sw04121-A_026196-026839 yeah well now i know that i know that the same thing applies for aluminum it's much more profitable than glass
sw04121-A_026839-027946 um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because there's ev[ery]- we'd been going out to the bars around here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles
sw04121-A_027946-028340 so we thought well you got this ready market you know the
sw04121-A_028340-029003 these bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet there's there's almost no way you could make money at it
sw04121-A_029003-029856 because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit you'd make because glass is you know but i'm sure that as far as aluminum
sw04121-B_000000-000016 [noise]
sw04121-B_000016-000190 okay so
sw04121-B_000441-001391 um around here we can recycle almost anything um we have paper and cans and uh newspaper i guess
sw04121-B_001391-002092 um and then i guess plastic and glass it's a little harder to do but you we can recycle those as well
sw04121-B_002467-003322 there's curbside but um for items like glass and and plastic it's only like once every three weeks or something crazy like that
sw04121-B_003322-003982 so you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to put anything out any other night so [laughter]
sw04121-B_006154-006288 right
sw04121-B_006288-006589 oh yeah so you don't have to split anything up
sw04121-B_006589-006740 oh okay
sw04121-B_006740-006858 well
sw04121-B_007900-008113 [laughter] uh-huh
sw04121-B_009632-009784 right
sw04121-B_009784-010500 well i uh the last place i lived was really it was in New Jersey as well but it was um
sw04121-B_010500-011893 it was really a lot hard harder to do it because_1 um it's different depending on what town you're in basically every town is different which i think that that's crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but
sw04121-B_011893-012049 yeah
sw04121-B_012740-012860 uh-huh
sw04121-B_012963-013085 right
sw04121-B_014736-014857 are you
sw04121-B_014857-015000 are you
sw04121-B_015000-015326 oh yeah are you living at school or are you outside of school
sw04121-B_015495-015936 oh okay so it's not just the school that's doing it or
sw04121-B_015936-016095 okay
sw04121-B_017426-017550 right
sw04121-B_018229-018360 right
sw04121-B_018797-018920 oh
sw04121-B_019023-019441 okay i thought they were afraid of putting them out of work or something
sw04121-B_019952-020091 okay
sw04121-B_020836-020963 right
sw04121-B_022360-022490 um-hum
sw04121-B_023398-023504 [laughter]
sw04121-B_023504-023603 yeah
sw04121-B_023868-025137 well not for individuals but like my company uh started doing recycling because it became mandatory in the state i i think it was mandatory in the state but they did it and they started a recycling program
sw04121-B_025137-025350 just of paper i guess
sw04121-B_025350-025826 and in two years they saved like four million dollars
sw04121-B_025826-026258 um they that's how much money they got paid for their paper
sw04121-B_026258-026357 and
sw04121-B_026772-026899 uh-huh
sw04121-B_027603-027735 [laughter]
sw04121-B_027899-028032 uh-huh
sw04121-B_028176-028302 right
sw04121-B_028959-029090 right
sw04121-B_029465-029589 uh-huh
sw04122-A_000000-000224 [noise] so do you work for an employer who uh
sw04122-A_000224-000397 gives you health benefits
sw04122-A_000738-000861 oh yeah
sw04122-A_001562-001692 uh-huh
sw04122-A_001692-001915 uh um
sw04122-A_001915-002399 do you have any any interesting benefits aside from basic health coverage
sw04122-A_003646-003783 um
sw04122-A_003883-004331 do uh do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage
sw04122-A_004818-004950 uh-huh
sw04122-A_005186-005314 uh-huh
sw04122-A_005542-005881 and uh is your whole family covered or do
sw04122-A_006206-006342 uh-huh
sw04122-A_006483-006841 i see so through your husband or
sw04122-A_006841-007013 uh-huh
sw04122-A_007013-007198 oh i see
sw04122-A_007604-007857 okay d[o]- but do you have children
sw04122-A_007857-008246 oh okay so that's real simple yeah here uh
sw04122-A_008246-008902 it's just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much
sw04122-A_008902-009035 uh
sw04122-A_009163-009629 yeah i think it's pretty significant benefit uh really uh
sw04122-A_009629-009979 makes you wanna stick around [laughter]
sw04122-A_010195-011001 [laughter-yeah] that's just what you want to hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out
sw04122-A_011001-011230 uh which seems kind of unfair
sw04122-A_011230-011372 uh
sw04122-A_011549-011950 yeah yeah we have we can choose uh
sw04122-A_011950-012590 a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you don't use much you actually get cash back
sw04122-A_012590-013576 um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO
sw04122-A_013576-014807 uh well i used to have that when i was single and i wa[s]- i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage that's i guess it's optional bu[t]- i think we can get one pair of glasses a year
sw04122-A_014807-015537 that's so yeah it's pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year
sw04122-A_015537-015803 but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference
sw04122-A_016208-016344 uh-huh
sw04122-A_016872-017057 yeah it's nice
sw04122-A_017286-018136 yeah it can uh at least it's not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um
sw04122-A_018136-018392 let's s[ee]- you have any kind of uh
sw04122-A_018392-018660 child care benefits or
sw04122-A_018660-018785 anything in
sw04122-A_019316-019445 uh-huh
sw04122-A_019945-020090 uh-huh
sw04122-A_020090-020844 that's a problem sometimes i understand when the baby's not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and
sw04122-A_020844-021452 yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh
sw04122-A_021452-021695 the appointment even though there's not really one
sw04122-A_021695-021938 yeah some seems more honest
sw04122-A_022642-023591 uh-huh well that's good that's good and d[o]- is there any kind of interesting uh wh[at]- i mean what happens after the baby's born is there some uh some maternity leave policy
sw04122-A_024107-024248 uh-huh
sw04122-A_024611-024751 uh
sw04122-A_025997-026130 uh-huh
sw04122-A_026724-027133 i see so they they're preferred providers or is that a
sw04122-A_027246-027719 right and you pay a little more or certain things aren't as well covered but at least you have that option
sw04122-A_027719-028144 that's nice because_1 once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with
sw04122-A_028144-028615 you know what you have or or so[mebody]- just somebody you've dealt with already a
sw04122-A_028615-028738 an[d]-
sw04122-A_029275-029420 uh-huh
sw04122-A_029786-029907 uh-huh
sw04122-B_000000-000055 [noise]

sw04122-B_005030-005237 excep[t]- unless it's major
sw04122-B_005237-005598 but anything minor or just checkups that's all covered
sw04122-B_005800-006250 no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money
sw04122-B_006250-006531 but they're not they have their own
sw04122-B_006720-007104 oh no me i'm single it's just through me
sw04122-B_007104-007626 it's it's uh so it's and i[t]- that makes it cheaper too since i'm single
sw04122-B_007803-007965 no no
sw04122-B_007965-008163 yeah [laughter]
sw04122-B_008163-008286 [noise]
sw04122-B_008650-008788 yeah
sw04122-B_008788-009252 not much not for the good but it's really good the benefits are good
sw04122-B_009361-009498 um-hum
sw04122-B_009795-010288 yeah yeah they have they uh it does [laughter]
sw04122-B_010393-010531 yeah
sw04122-B_010695-010821 um-hum
sw04122-B_010923-011049 yeah
sw04122-B_011237-011640 do do you work where you have benefits like that
sw04122-B_012540-012707 oh really
sw04122-B_013595-013729 yeah th[e]-
sw04122-B_013934-014054 um-hum
sw04122-B_014474-014598 yeah
sw04122-B_014758-014949 really well that's good
sw04122-B_015715-016797 uh-huh see that's see i wear glasses not all the time but when i read and stuff and um i wish we had some kind of optical
sw04122-B_016797-017029 coverage but there's
sw04122-B_017029-017355 there's none whatsoever and it can get expensive
sw04122-B_017725-017874 yeah
sw04122-B_018605-019383 um yeah for the um actually if you're i believe i i read up on some of it if you're pregnant
sw04122-B_019383-020211 they have really really good coverage they have um like well baby care it's it's pretty much covered
sw04122-B_020211-020374 um-hum
sw04122-B_020742-020970 especially when they're younger
sw04122-B_021230-021351 yeah
sw04122-B_021650-021772 um-hum
sw04122-B_021878-022075 and though and the
sw04122-B_022075-022247 pregnant mother has
sw04122-B_022380-022636 uh full coverage for well mother care
sw04122-B_023589-024137 um that's what i was trying to i think there is i don't really remember how long it is
sw04122-B_024137-024698 but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess
sw04122-B_024698-024834 and um
sw04122-B_025009-026056 most of the benefits are pretty good the hospital benefits and and they let you pick your own doctor you have your choice actually if um it's better they give you a list
sw04122-B_026056-026821 and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company
sw04122-B_026948-027280 yeah but you can have your own doctor
sw04122-B_027413-027537 yeah
sw04122-B_027537-027781 yeah um-hum
sw04122-B_028251-028390 um-hum
sw04122-B_028554-029638 yeah and and a lot of times because_1 we just switched my comp[any]- my uh company just switched insurance companies and before [noise]
sw04122-B_029638-029823 we did not have that choice
sw04123-A_000000-000098 [noise] any
sw04123-A_000098-000369 so how do you get most of your news
sw04123-A_001789-002398 oh wow so [noise] when you say the morning news or evening news or [vocalized-noise] national news is when
sw04123-A_002686-003457 oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or s[omething]- watch CNN a lot but i don't uh
sw04123-A_003457-004151 [noise] i don't uh subscribe to cable be[cause]- because of the poor service and also uh
sw04123-A_004151-004936 because well i uh i give to the United Way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
sw04123-A_005083-005644 [noise] yeah i take away a uh a addiction [laughter] or something
sw04123-A_005644-005803 well i
sw04123-A_008273-008438 oh
sw04123-A_008438-008820 what what uh newspapers do you read
sw04123-A_009707-010278 uh for a while there i- i- i uh subscribed to New York Times
sw04123-A_010278-011198 a[ctually]- actually a couple of newspapers because_1 uh you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the
sw04123-A_011198-012182 the want help wanted ads and so often they they tr[y]- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspap[er]- of news
sw04123-A_012182-013443 and i do[n't]- know New York Times is okay but um i do[n't]- know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but
sw04123-A_013443-014241 uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level but i swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes
sw04123-A_014241-014923 [noise] but i don't know um i think i[f]- if you listen to like NPR or something like
sw04123-A_014923-015919 that's pretty good um and i like listening to that on on uh when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because_1 i
sw04123-A_017250-017372 uh
sw04123-A_018198-018661 well Mc[Neil]- Lehrer McNeil and Lehrer i guess he's leaving one of them is leaving [vocalized-noise]
sw04123-A_018661-019018 uh they're they're pretty good too um
sw04123-A_019018-019622 i guess a year ago you're probably watching CNN a lot right had that invasion or whatever it is
sw04123-A_019622-020214 uh but i- i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the [noise]
sw04123-A_020214-020625 the Smith trial i mean that was a joke uh
sw04123-A_021479-021941 oh yeah the NPR doing that yeah i know the i had uh
sw04123-A_021941-022745 some visitor and he was just in just i don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly [noise]
sw04123-A_022745-023943 um and i guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that but that's not really providing you news it's it's more like a media event rather than reporting
sw04123-A_024690-025097 oh really that's kind of boring to me i think [laughter]
sw04123-A_026549-026679 yeah
sw04123-A_027449-028794 yeah i guess that's true but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company and
sw04123-A_028794-029473 it's called Intellect and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are r[eally]- really literally
sw04123-A_029473-029754 i've i've actually read the actual articles they're pretty g[ood]-
sw04123-B_000000-000106 [noise]
sw04123-B_000283-000548 well [noise] i kind of uh [noise]
sw04123-B_000548-001372 i watch the um national news everyday for one i also read one or two papers a day
sw04123-B_001372-001870 and i'm a i'm pretty much a news junkie and i tune in to CNN a lot
sw04123-B_002334-002770 uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news
sw04123-B_003686-003824 uh-huh
sw04123-B_004850-005146 uh-huh as opposed to paying for cable
sw04123-B_005420-005535 [laughter]
sw04123-B_005535-005669 yeah
sw04123-B_005669-006285 uh overall i- i the quality of the news you get o[ff]- off of most uh
sw04123-B_006285-007131 sources i would say is pretty low it's usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get
sw04123-B_007131-008528 as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it's still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
sw04123-B_008800-009799 well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times or something like that
sw04123-B_011320-011456 uh-huh
sw04123-B_012110-012244 right
sw04123-B_013352-013486 uh-huh
sw04123-B_013828-014014 right
sw04123-B_014014-014337 [laughter] pretty low
sw04123-B_014768-015056 right i- i really like NPR a lot
sw04123-B_015798-016565 right yeah i miss NPR a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your
sw04123-B_016565-017485 TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a [vocalized-noise] ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good and they also
sw04123-B_017485-018225 their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
sw04123-B_018557-018690 uh-huh
sw04123-B_019300-019504 [laughter-right] yeah
sw04123-B_019504-019684 sure was
sw04123-B_020350-020516 uh-huh
sw04123-B_020516-020720 yeah that was
sw04123-B_020720-021556 but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was r[eally]- really good
sw04123-B_022579-022713 uh-huh
sw04123-B_023411-023551 right
sw04123-B_023736-023989 well but the but the new[s]- news
sw04123-B_023989-024854 news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C-SPAN which i- i tune into every once in a while
sw04123-B_024970-025350 yeah it it is really kind of boring but you know that's
sw04123-B_025350-026112 if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to
sw04123-B_026112-027480 if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own -[o]pinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
sw04124-A_000000-000247 [noise] okay supposedly we're recording right now
sw04124-A_000247-001602 uh it's kind of interesting because_1 nearly thirty minutes ago i was reading an advertisement for the new Infinity i forget what model number it was but one of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system
sw04124-A_003672-004245 yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too um actually i was kind of i'm su[rprised]- kind of surprised that that
sw04124-A_004245-005240 has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um
sw04124-A_005240-006205 yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does
sw04124-A_006205-006623 so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has
sw04124-A_008750-008844 um
sw04124-A_009377-009518 um-hum
sw04124-A_009518-009701 yeah
sw04124-A_009701-010406 so what what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing
sw04124-A_012098-012992 yeah yeah i um traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen miles per gallon
sw04124-A_012992-013527 of worth of o[n]- on premium and didn't really wasn't happy with premium wasn't high enough
sw04124-A_013527-014049 to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on uh the cheapest garbage you can put in it
sw04124-A_014049-014941 so i probably contributed my share there and um kind of interesting course um there is talk about legislation that would ban
sw04124-A_014941-015686 the manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and um
sw04124-A_015686-016479 this i believe has i read has put the general aviation uh world going nuts because
sw04124-A_016479-017389 a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul and if it flies a hundred hours a year
sw04124-A_017389-018217 that's moderately high so the amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved
sw04124-A_018217-018944 um are very very tiny as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's running for a lot longer per year
sw04124-A_018944-019586 um so it's a question of um now apparently uh the EPA thought about this again and decided that
sw04124-A_019586-019911 these that that general aviation engines won't count
sw04124-A_019911-020659 and they'll allow them to continue to burn leaded fuels but there's some concern over if this is the only market is anybody gonna wanna bother making leaded fuels
sw04124-A_023803-024177 it's an old joke about the uh finest Congressman money can buy
sw04124-A_024450-024755 sounds like another issue um
sw04124-A_024755-025605 you know i've always viewed it as um the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn
sw04124-A_025605-025831 um regularly
sw04124-A_025831-026352 you'd have legal recourse but if he dumps it into the air surrounding your house you really don't have any
sw04124-A_026352-027024 and um i think therein lies a big part of the problem is that it's it's viewed a little differently from physical pollution
sw04124-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04124-B_000201-000341 [laughter]
sw04124-B_001658-002397 that's interesting i hadn't seen that i know there was a lot of talk about freon contributing to the
sw04124-B_002397-003016 the uh hole in the ozone layer and other various pollution but uh other than
sw04124-B_003016-003738 uh making the air conditioning systems tighter i didn't know that there was any work on uh alternate coolants
sw04124-B_004682-004805 um-hum
sw04124-B_006647-007311 the uh the the times that i've seen any sort of of loss is uh
sw04124-B_007311-008075 at a time when maybe i'd have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off
sw04124-B_008075-009270 and it seemed to me that they'd practically waste almost as much as uh they'd put in the car but i've noticed in the past few years that uh the controls on that are
sw04124-B_009270-009790 tighter uh people are a lot more concerned about that
sw04124-B_010168-010817 well obviously cars uh and trucks contribute quite a bit
sw04124-B_010817-011819 and personally i'll uh i carpool uh most of the time with someone i work with but my schedule doesn't uh
sw04124-B_011819-012243 doesn't make for a consistent carpool
sw04124-B_013450-013573 [laughter]
sw04124-B_013967-014138 [laughter]
sw04124-B_017000-017128 um-hum
sw04124-B_020803-022029 that's a that's a good question uh the leaded fuels have obviously been out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk about uh
sw04124-B_022029-023038 [noise] about regulating the emissions that a a car engine can produce and tightening down on that and of course the uh
sw04124-B_023038-023855 the large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep business just the same as usual
sw04124-B_024113-024303 [laughter]
sw04124-B_027085-028450 there's a big issue in Rhode Island right now uh there's a company that wants to build a coal fired uh energy plant very close to to downtown Providence
sw04124-B_028450-029715 and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various controls and inspections and regulations apparently the
sw04124-B_029715-029856 the regula[tions]-
sw04125-A_000000-000365 well Toby have you ever served on a jury in a criminal trial
sw04125-A_000886-001602 well i'm not sure whether you're the lucky one or i am [laughter] because i have done it and uh
sw04125-A_001602-001776 uh
sw04125-A_001776-002793 well we had a hung jury so i i came away really disappointed in the process or the least the people involved i was very frustrated about that
sw04125-A_002941-003662 i i think it was something like oh ten to three ten to two or nine to three or something like that
sw04125-A_003662-004182 which really means that if if we hadn't of had to have unanimous decision
sw04125-A_004182-004374 we would uh
sw04125-A_004374-004701 would have completed our mission if you will
sw04125-A_007024-007220 i think it was ten [laughter-people]
sw04125-A_007220-007309 [laughter]
sw04125-A_007309-007501 no it's the funny
sw04125-A_009921-010032 yeah
sw04125-A_010332-011241 well the the crazy thing about this trial was that the guy said yes i did this i did this armed robbery but he wanted a jury to decide his sentence
sw04125-A_011241-011545 and we couldn't even agree on a sentence
sw04125-A_011545-011777 [laughter]
sw04125-A_011777-012684 i i mean i was ready to put the guy guy away forever but i was dealing with people who said well if it were my son i'd want him to have another chance
sw04125-A_012684-012905 [laughter] i [laughter-know]
sw04125-A_013620-013908 oh is that right otherwise the judge does it
sw04125-A_014288-014594 do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed
sw04125-A_018365-018446 yeah
sw04125-A_018446-019506 well and i do not know if it is this way it all states or not but in Texas there are severe limitations on what the jury can kn[ow]- know about the the prior history of the alleged criminal
sw04125-A_019506-020436 and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing Like if you give somebody fifteen years they'll be out in three weeks or something like that
sw04125-A_020436-021104 i maybe it's not quite that radical but but those things are not those are things are kept from the jury
sw04125-A_022393-022613 yeah why [laughter]
sw04125-A_024552-024647 uh-huh
sw04125-A_029256-029377 huh
sw04125-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04125-B_000374-000866 no i've always wanted to and uh but they never uh my name never seems to come up
sw04125-B_001204-001372 [laughter]
sw04125-B_001650-001836 what did you think of the process
sw04125-B_002737-002996 how hung was it i mean what was the vote
sw04125-B_003416-003534 uh-huh
sw04125-B_004590-005033 yeah yeah but it's [noise]
sw04125-B_005033-005946 i don't know i i've always thought that the f[act]- th[e]- the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't any doubt in people's minds
sw04125-B_005946-006893 and if it uh if in like in your case if there's two people who who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty
sw04125-B_006893-007268 then or innocent i you didn't say which way it went
sw04125-B_007268-007405 [laughter]
sw04125-B_007405-007902 it can go either way if there's two people that aren't convinced one way or the other then that's
sw04125-B_007902-008977 um you know i don't i think one one change that might be worthwhile would be to say that you need unanimous verdict to find somebody guilty
sw04125-B_008977-009502 but but if you don't get a unanimous guilty verdict then they're innocent
sw04125-B_009502-009952 because the prosecution didn't prove their case to all twelve people
sw04125-B_010076-010180 um
sw04125-B_011511-011652 huh
sw04125-B_011652-011796 huh
sw04125-B_012695-012828 that's ridiculous
sw04125-B_012828-013668 [vocalized-noise] um here in Georgia the only time that the jury gets involved in sentencing at all is in capital punishment cases
sw04125-B_013825-014324 the judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here
sw04125-B_014565-014905 i think it is appropriate i think that the judge
sw04125-B_014905-016305 probably has a much better uh feel for uh what sentences other people who have committed comparable p[unishment]- crimes have received and what the guidelines are and uh
sw04125-B_016305-017201 i- i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be
sw04125-B_017201-018412 well a fairly objective uh thing uh i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of
sw04125-B_019452-019557 um-hum
sw04125-B_021039-022457 yeah here in Georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing like in a capital case the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you if you give them life he'll be out in seven years that's against the rules
sw04125-B_022457-022989 uh but in with the judge making all the other sentences
sw04125-B_022989-023720 uh course the judge has open to him all of the previous criminal history uh
sw04125-B_023720-024642 uh and uh obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines uh or what all the effects can be of parole and things like that
sw04125-B_024642-024968 um well i think the
sw04125-B_024968-025528 th[e]- the reform of the jury process that i would like most to see
sw04125-B_025528-026616 is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to judge not only the facts of the case but also the law itself
sw04125-B_026616-027021 uh juries and lot of people are not aware of this but it is
sw04125-B_027021-028131 it's part of the common law and it th[ey]- really is in Georgia it is part of the state Constitution and it is in the Constitution of a lot of states that if the jury
sw04125-B_028131-029241 uh believes that the law that someone is being tried on is unjust the law itself is unjust the jury can refuse to convict the person
sw04125-B_029241-029917 uh and this is sort of the people's uh last line of defense against govern[ments]-
sw04126-A_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04126-A_000340-000887 yeah i just started about uh two months ago consistently doing it um
sw04126-A_000887-001377 yeah i uh i walk jog three times a week for about an hour
sw04126-A_001377-002055 yeah so i've just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then
sw04126-A_002055-002400 um about mile and a half of walking
sw04126-A_002400-002563 so
sw04126-A_002697-002851 oh
sw04126-A_002851-003150 oh okay what kind of work do you do
sw04126-A_003150-003334 oh okay
sw04126-A_003334-003461 yeah
sw04126-A_003826-004076 okay_1 so you consider that your exercise
sw04126-A_004178-004275 yeah
sw04126-A_004930-005396 hum what kind of exercise program would you think you might want to get into
sw04126-A_006245-006372 um-hum
sw04126-A_006474-006651 maintain it
sw04126-A_006761-007508 oh well what kind of things do you like to do like um do you like to run or play a sport or
sw04126-A_007508-007718 bicycle ride
sw04126-A_007943-008076 um-hum
sw04126-A_008623-008963 yeah [laughter] well it's kind of hard on the joints
sw04126-A_008963-009231 there's a lot of other things to do
sw04126-A_009231-009491 bicycle riding is pretty good for you
sw04126-A_009491-010267 you don't have to put any um shock no it doesn't shock your joints or there's no pounding or anything
sw04126-A_010267-010637 yeah so you think you might get an exercise bicycle
sw04126-A_011005-011131 oh
sw04126-A_011570-011707 yeah
sw04126-A_011847-012831 yeah that's the problem with with that is like if you wanna be consistent and then the weather's bad you can't really or get out when it's cold or whatever
sw04126-A_012831-012959 yeah
sw04126-A_012959-013577 so i have an exercise bike at home but i don't use it [laughter] it just kind of sits there in the corner
sw04126-A_013684-013791 but
sw04126-A_013996-014649 yeah and the reason that i'm doing it is because i have a friend doing it with me otherwise i wouldn't have the motivation
sw04126-A_014915-015064 yeah [noise]
sw04126-A_015064-015828 well it's you know i'm a student and i'm in school all day and i'm really tired the end of the day and a lot of times i just wanna go home

sw04126-A_015932-016168 and eat [laughter]
sw04126-A_016168-016838 but knowing that my friend's waiting for me you know i meet her at the stadium where we work out um
sw04126-A_016838-017555 it makes me go and then after i do it i i'm glad i went and i enjoy it and i have more energy yeah after you do it
sw04126-A_017555-017858 so and we encourage each other
sw04126-A_017858-018006 so
sw04126-A_018544-018672 oh
sw04126-A_018774-018931 that's great
sw04126-A_019388-019508 yeah
sw04126-A_019609-020152 it's hard you let other things get in the way and and the you're busy
sw04126-A_020152-020467 yeah and if you have a family and
sw04126-A_020729-021417 yeah it's kind of hard to it's like you have to schedule a time and stick to it but it's hard when
sw04126-A_021417-022275 you don't have somebody to do it with you it's easy to just say well i'm not gonna do it today but i'll do it tomorrow and then you never do it [laughter]
sw04126-A_022417-022545 um-hum
sw04126-A_022721-022902 oh
sw04126-A_022902-023100 yeah that would be tough
sw04126-A_023100-023235 yeah
sw04126-A_023235-023391 well
sw04126-A_023609-023760 um-hum
sw04126-A_023760-023981 yeah well maybe you can
sw04126-A_023981-024119 you can um
sw04126-A_024225-024566 i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and

sw04126-A_027905-028049 yeah
sw04126-A_028049-028207 um-hum
sw04126-A_028349-029670 you see if you just keep that up you know that's not too much time and then i bet it'll really improve your you know your cardiovascular system and and all of that because_1 they say even if you just do that it increases
sw04126-A_029670-029885 your life span i don't know how much but

sw04126-B_013650-014074 yeah but you got a good exercise program going on it looks like
sw04126-B_014622-015129 yeah so your motivation is having somebody do it with you
sw04126-B_015443-015597 yeah
sw04126-B_016035-016194 [laughter]
sw04126-B_016712-016845 yeah

sw04127-A_001592-002469 i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are
sw04127-A_002469-002821 outstanding and and every two or three months
sw04127-A_002821-003169 update that and every once in a while
sw04127-A_003169-003693 make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year
sw04127-A_003693-003831 and
sw04127-A_003831-004949 no i work with them_1 all day yeah i'm in computer science yet i- i do everything on paper [laughter] uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because_1 it's all pretty round numbers

sw04127-A_007168-007305 yeah i
sw04127-A_008286-008407 um-hum

sw04127-A_009304-009464 straightforward
sw04127-A_009464-009920 it's almo[st]- i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
sw04127-A_009920-010570 you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level y[ou're]- you're not in real good control
sw04127-A_011252-011381 uh-huh
sw04127-A_011635-011759 yeah
sw04127-A_011759-012264 actually i'm i me[an]- i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills
sw04127-A_012264-013029 because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping [laughter-records] of anything else because they come in at the end of the month
sw04127-A_013346-013467 uh
sw04127-A_014036-014140 hum
sw04127-A_014997-015198 yeah i guess if that's
sw04127-A_015198-015488 if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
sw04127-A_016101-016231 um-hum
sw04127-A_016420-016544 sure

sw04127-A_020127-020248 yeah
sw04127-A_020248-020657 i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it
sw04127-A_020657-021151 it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it
sw04127-A_021251-021397 i
sw04127-A_021397-021704 yeah just the form yeah

sw04127-A_023930-023979 [laughter]
sw04127-A_024291-025058 i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i
sw04127-A_025058-025190 i keep
sw04127-A_025190-026125 on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention

sw04127-A_026369-026503 [vocalized-noise]

sw04127-B_006582-007374 you know so they come in i pay them_1 and that's it [laughter-you] [laughter-know] that's about the extent of it you know
sw04127-B_007374-008741 i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know
sw04127-B_008741-009188 what little we have [laughter] so that's what i do
sw04127-B_009903-010047 no
sw04127-B_010525-010651 huh-uh
sw04127-B_010651-011657 you know i mean i- i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
sw04127-B_011657-011866 you know so
sw04127-B_012207-012354 uh-huh
sw04127-B_012796-012964 i don't have too many wea[knesses]-
sw04127-B_012964-013394 i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them_1
sw04127-B_013394-014558 you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person it's like oh well that's on sale let's go grab it you know [laughter] so um
sw04127-B_014558-015066 and if you don't have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards
sw04127-B_015167-015300 you know
sw04127-B_015408-016455 yeah that was my weakness it wasn't bad i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know
sw04127-B_016455-016603 so
sw04127-B_016603-016930 but i self employed
sw04127-B_016930-017648 you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep
sw04127-B_017849-019054 no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and um you know what it's gonna have to go for that month and
sw04127-B_019054-019373 you know it's not that not that hard
sw04127-B_019373-019549 not at all
sw04127-B_019743-019864 so
sw04127-B_019864-020120 i always do my own income tax
sw04127-B_020120-020352 you know do you
sw04127-B_020600-020735 huh
sw04127-B_021016-021242 rea[d]- all you got to do is read a book
sw04127-B_021242-022433 i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
sw04127-B_022433-022948 it's dumb [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i guess if you had some really complicated
sw04127-B_022948-023407 stuff but i don't so i don't mess with it
sw04127-B_023513-024394 but i don't use a calculator either [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i don't i don't have that mu[ch]- that many you know things to add up so
sw04127-B_026066-026247 oh yeah
sw04127-B_026349-027152 and we have a i- i bank at NCNB here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like
sw04127-B_027152-027750 once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and
sw04127-B_027750-027934 do you do that
sw04127-B_027934-028935 you do too and i always check them_1 off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because_1 i always want to know exactly what i have
sw04127-B_028935-029325 you know i do that real often
sw04127-B_029325-029534 i do that so
sw04127-B_029657-029778 anyway
sw04128-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04128-A_004431-004578 uh-huh
sw04128-A_006900-007533 yeah uh you know the it comes down to a hard call because um
sw04128-A_007533-007867 i now i'm personally have never served on a jury
sw04128-A_007867-009031 uh i've been in school and so that's waived my jury duty and so exactly some of the procedures that they go through for the jury uh as far as sentencing goes i'm not real clear on
sw04128-A_009031-009898 but from i understand there's sometimes whenever the juries make the verdict i mean the uh the sentencing and sometimes they don't
sw04128-A_012596-012793 oh really
sw04128-A_013798-013946 uh-huh
sw04128-A_015199-015447 oh yeah yeah
sw04128-A_016978-017119 you'll
sw04128-A_017119-017448 you'll probably be weeded out huh [laughter]
sw04128-A_018348-018495 uh-huh
sw04128-A_022496-022900 on on on what they do and and
sw04128-A_024647-024800 persuaded
sw04128-A_024800-024950 yeah
sw04128-A_025249-025449 yeah yeah
sw04128-A_025549-025871 well i think in a way it also depends on what kind of trial it is
sw04128-A_025871-027348 um because sometimes you know if if it's dealing w[ith]- with a more technical thing such as like a malpractice not not like a criminal suit you're going to have to have somebody that that can understand the uh like the medical or the legal implications
sw04128-A_027348-027529 you know
sw04128-A_028280-028427 uh-huh
sw04128-A_029154-029299 uh-huh
sw04128-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04128-B_000049-001095 okay uh let's see when it comes to to uh sentencing i i'm a little confused because the the only things that i read about sentencing
sw04128-B_001095-001878 and juries well the only things i know are the things that i read and the things that i read are are either how should i say it they're
sw04128-B_001878-003019 they're written by people that that have an axe to grind so if somebody thinks that the judge is judges are too lenient why i read all kinds of let's throw them all in jail and then if i i've
sw04128-B_003019-003647 you know i've i've read other things that i i wish i could see a uh an informed
sw04128-B_003647-004050 uh discussion as opposed to just
sw04128-B_004050-004422 what i see these days as one side you know some one side's mad
sw04128-B_004530-004695 and uh
sw04128-B_004695-004899 so i uh
sw04128-B_004899-005600 i i guess what i'm trying to say is uh i have mixed feelings because sometimes i think that the judges um
sw04128-B_005600-007000 are overstepping their bounds and they shouldn't be the the juries should be the only ones that uh have a say in it and other times i think well no the juries are out of hand the judges need to step in
sw04128-B_007000-009850 [noise]
sw04128-B_009850-010997 on the case i've remember reading a a discussion about a jury that that uh heard a case and they and they awarded
sw04128-B_010997-011150 uh
sw04128-B_011150-012250 uh how should i say it they agreed that the one person was guilty and they and they agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement which
sw04128-B_012250-012700 [vocalized-noise] the way the article was written was a terrible injustice
sw04128-B_012700-013103 uh but like i say i uh
sw04128-B_013103-014384 there's i rarely see uh both sides of that i just hear about it from one side i don't hear the other side the the one thing that i am kind of upset about is the fact that juries are selected
sw04128-B_014384-015373 uh to be the lowest uh how should i say this they have any opinions at all they're weeded out been one or the other of the uh of the lawyers
sw04128-B_015373-015548 and so
sw04128-B_015652-015948 to be honest with you i've i've uh
sw04128-B_016049-016566 i don't think that's right and if i ever am called to be a a juror
sw04128-B_016566-016931 and they ask me if i have strong opinions i'm i'm just
sw04128-B_016931-017099 i'm not
sw04128-B_017099-017250 [laughter]
sw04128-B_017250-018422 well i- i i if i answer honestly if i answer honestly i'll be weeded out if i if i just like looked at him and say uh no i don't have strong opinions because i feel like you know i want to be part of the process
sw04128-B_018422-018875 and uh like i say it bothers me that that th[e]-
sw04128-B_018875-019120 that the
sw04128-B_019120-019275 lawyers
sw04128-B_019275-019450 can
sw04128-B_019450-019928 weed anybody with a college education or anybody uh
sw04128-B_019928-021026 [noise] oh let's say with a with any college educa[tions]- you know much schooling or certain [vocalized-noise] uh uh backgrounds like for instance if you're a
sw04128-B_021026-022225 if you've go to church once a a a month or something like that why they don't want you on the jury or you know things like that it it bothers me that that that we're judging people on the basis of
sw04128-B_022225-022598 of uh what do you call it uh
sw04128-B_022850-024299 no well what i'm trying to say is the jury jurors are selected to basically be from what i've been told milk toasts if they have any opinions if they could understand anything an engineer could never be uh a juror for instance because he's
sw04128-B_024299-024449 he's uh
sw04128-B_024449-025399 he's not easily uh persuaded or or or how shall i say this th[is]- it's easy to hoodwink or it's it's hard to hoodwink him that kind of thing
sw04128-B_025399-025601 so that's what i'm kind of worried about
sw04128-B_027297-028103 right uh that's what you want but on the other hand if the lawyer thinks no i don't want a bunch of people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through
sw04128-B_028103-029198 uh you know to weed the good from the bad they will absolutely go for people who uh how should i say it the s[crub]- the scrub women and the the janitors i'm i'm
sw04128-B_029198-029840 trying not to be prejudiced against them but you know any any education will disqualify you in in many cases i've been
sw04129-A_000000-000339 [noise] okay_1 so what are what are your views o[n]- on capital punishment
sw04129-A_001811-001939 yes
sw04129-A_002357-002730 so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state
sw04129-A_003789-004154 yes that's similar to Georgia uh
sw04129-A_005087-005330 that's probably true considering
sw04129-A_005330-006202 yes yes um i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if
sw04129-A_006703-006824 yes
sw04129-A_006924-007188 right that would be the intent of it
sw04129-A_007500-007897 well i think it would be more successful if it was applied
sw04129-A_007897-008948 in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment
sw04129-A_009050-009492 uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f[or]- with Georgia Tech
sw04129-A_009658-009771 um
sw04129-A_009874-009997 yes
sw04129-A_011136-011258 hum
sw04129-A_012501-012630 um-hum
sw04129-A_013401-013649 um that's probably true but i guess
sw04129-A_013649-014302 there's other factors that but pu[mping]- pu[mping]- pumping more money into the school system is a good thing but it's not gonna
sw04129-A_014302-014486 oh i see
sw04129-A_016361-016490 um-hum
sw04129-A_016921-017041 um
sw04129-A_017564-017800 so that's a difficult situation
sw04129-A_018565-018692 um
sw04129-A_019988-020115 um-hum
sw04129-A_020944-021072 um-hum
sw04129-A_021250-021499 well that's probably true wh[at]-
sw04129-A_021987-022092 hum
sw04129-A_022192-022629 yeah i guess that's not an easy solution there's there's no easy solution for that
sw04129-A_023285-023411 um-hum
sw04129-A_024166-024352 [laughter]
sw04129-A_024352-024551 i'm sure it is yeah
sw04129-A_024706-025238 hum yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't gonna solve a lot of problems but
sw04129-A_025238-025429 uh
sw04129-A_025429-025830 i guess i am for certain cri[mes]- yeah in certain crimes
sw04129-A_025993-026293 um premeditated murder
sw04129-A_026293-026945 crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual
sw04129-A_027680-027803 hum
sw04129-A_028006-028140 um-hum
sw04129-A_028358-028583 well you always have [laughter-castration]
sw04129-A_028751-028962 yes i read about that
sw04129-A_028962-029069 [laughter]
sw04129-A_029367-029498 um-hum
sw04129-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04129-B_000286-001061 i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is
sw04129-B_001061-001868 but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
sw04129-B_001868-002170 and it's eating us alive budget wise
sw04129-B_002170-002375 and um
sw04129-B_002539-003819 yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
sw04129-B_003996-005123 yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because_1 i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody tha[n]- than it does to keep them_1
sw04129-B_005123-005498 because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know
sw04129-B_006099-006390 well i think capital punishment is supposed to be
sw04129-B_006390-006733 primarily a deterrent to other people
sw04129-B_006834-006981 you know who would see it
sw04129-B_007100-007385 yeah but i'm not sure
sw04129-B_007385-007578 how successful that is
sw04129-B_008111-008311 quicker maybe yeah
sw04129-B_008493-008632 um-hum
sw04129-B_008866-009059 what what kind of work do you do
sw04129-B_009420-009723 hum well see i'm a school principal
sw04129-B_009723-009912 elementary school
sw04129-B_009912-010577 and in a very poor section of town with pr[edominantly]- predominantly Anglo kids
sw04129-B_010577-011146 and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals
sw04129-B_011146-011426 in spite of everything we can do
sw04129-B_011426-012045 and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people
sw04129-B_012148-012574 that i mean course you couldn't do that because_1 you got to do something with the ones that are already there
sw04129-B_012574-012997 but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids
sw04129-B_012997-013393 we'd have fewer decisions to make
sw04129-B_013551-013739 down the road you know
sw04129-B_013739-013900 oh yeah
sw04129-B_014028-014361 well i'm not talking about_1 just in the school system
sw04129-B_014361-014624 see i'm talking about_1 like in in uh
sw04129-B_014624-015056 i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes
sw04129-B_015056-015193 and
sw04129-B_015193-015333 reared
sw04129-B_015333-016424 uh i know institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day [laughter-because_1] [laughter-because_1] i have all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty seven kids
sw04129-B_016424-016987 five hundred of them_1 are good solid kids and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day
sw04129-B_016987-017284 and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
sw04129-B_017407-017600 some of them_1 in the penal system
sw04129-B_017742-018591 and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them_1 will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them_1 have already been in youth centers
sw04129-B_018695-019291 and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals
sw04129-B_019396-020038 and i'm not talking about_1 necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
sw04129-B_020038-020366 i think that's one reason we have problems in school sys[tems]-
sw04129-B_020366-020954 uh and some of them_1 are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we're supposed to do
sw04129-B_021138-021364 but that's another subject but
sw04129-B_021364-021731 anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are gonna end up
sw04129-B_021731-021997 where somebody has to make a decision what to do with them_1
sw04129-B_022445-022799 um-hum i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but
sw04129-B_022906-023323 if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be
sw04129-B_023423-023636 it would be money better spent
sw04129-B_023636-024252 than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard
sw04129-B_024252-024454 that's true
sw04129-B_024454-024689 statistically that's true
sw04129-B_024941-025062 um-hum
sw04129-B_025162-025308 are you for it
sw04129-B_025418-025763 i'm for it in in some cases yeah
sw04129-B_025763-026073 what kind of crimes would you do use it for
sw04129-B_026223-026360 um-hum
sw04129-B_026984-027500 i- i would consider it for sexual abuse of children
sw04129-B_027500-027680 on going
sw04129-B_027680-028063 you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
sw04129-B_028519-028790 well you know somebody elected that recently
sw04129-B_029047-029419 and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know
sw04129-B_029536-029684 but uh
sw04130-A_000000-000250 [noise] so Julie how do you feel about AIDS research
sw04130-A_000554-001159 i'd agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know
sw04130-A_001159-001786 um you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research done a lo[nger]- lo[nger]- longer ago
sw04130-A_001786-001908 you know because
sw04130-A_001908-002404 you know because um the country's gonna wind up paying for the treatment of patients
sw04130-A_002404-002548 um-hum
sw04130-A_003308-004285 i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll um check to see if you're HIV positive
sw04130-A_004285-005428 and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll um they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again
sw04130-A_006418-006536 yeah
sw04130-A_006712-006969 i think a lot of it was was just that
sw04130-A_006969-007728 you know becau[se]- because of of the audi[ence]- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about
sw04130-A_007728-007849 that
sw04130-A_008114-008224 um-hum
sw04130-A_008496-008626 um-hum
sw04130-A_008626-008746 yeah um
sw04130-A_008847-009866 yeah one one one hu[morous]- one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people
sw04130-A_010107-010268 but um
sw04130-A_010550-010789 [laughter]
sw04130-A_010789-010993 so um
sw04130-A_011388-011824 um do you think we're do you mean do you think we're actually doing enough right now to
sw04130-A_013666-013854 private organizations
sw04130-A_014003-014125 um-hum
sw04130-A_014797-014917 um-hum
sw04130-A_015249-015371 um-hum
sw04130-A_015582-015706 um-hum
sw04130-A_016791-016911 um-hum
sw04130-A_017044-017268 i mean it seems that you know
sw04130-A_017268-018339 it's just you know of it's just gonna reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud just to quo[te]- quote Barney Fife
sw04130-A_019339-019463 um-hum
sw04130-A_019673-019766 uh-huh
sw04130-A_020085-020215 um-hum
sw04130-A_020215-020415 i would probably agree with that
sw04130-A_020641-020786 um
sw04130-A_021251-021677 so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support
sw04130-A_021677-021824 of
sw04130-A_021824-022026 um people
sw04130-A_024052-024197 um-hum
sw04130-A_024197-024344 um-hum
sw04130-A_025155-025279 um-hum
sw04130-A_026299-026419 um-hum
sw04130-A_027190-027315 um-hum
sw04130-A_028545-028675 um-hum
sw04130-A_029292-029649 uh i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of
sw04130-A_029649-029785 um
sw04130-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04130-B_000167-000593 i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
sw04130-B_001663-001910 oh yeah yeah for certain
sw04130-B_002333-003178 exactly exactly does does like d[o]- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover
sw04130-B_003178-003366 diseases like that
sw04130-B_003892-004014 uh-huh
sw04130-B_005393-006822 um well that's but that's why they should have st[arted]- started doing stuff before i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know
sw04130-B_007499-007633 right
sw04130-B_007633-007749 right
sw04130-B_007854-008598 right and all these God fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera
sw04130-B_009473-009609 uh-huh
sw04130-B_009813-010013 [laughter]
sw04130-B_010013-010145 yeah
sw04130-B_010460-010636 boy that's a good one
sw04130-B_010636-010860 [laughter]
sw04130-B_011263-011399 yes
sw04130-B_011805-012379 no i really don't i did i did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff and uh
sw04130-B_012485-013362 really we're not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by um
sw04130-B_013362-013542 uh
sw04130-B_013542-014348 uh you know uh conscious yeah communities and things like that you know like uh San Francisco has uh
sw04130-B_014451-015827 a real um strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff and and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real and from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing
sw04130-B_015827-016004 and uh
sw04130-B_016004-017023 i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread
sw04130-B_018211-018441 right [laughter]
sw04130-B_018441-018649 yeah
sw04130-B_018779-019648 i don't know i don't know i I i don't know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up especially with the ultra conservative
sw04130-B_019648-020168 move our our political system sort of see[ms]- seems to be taking
sw04130-B_020359-020514 yeah yeah
sw04130-B_022025-022570 [noise] God that's a good question Fish i don't know um
sw04130-B_022690-023329 i think i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or
sw04130-B_023329-024601 research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know and it's really it's it's really not necessary
sw04130-B_024601-024699 uh
sw04130-B_024699-025236 until until the uh disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious
sw04130-B_025236-026018 and uh uh uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand
sw04130-B_026018-026919 you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely [noise]
sw04130-B_026919-027421 cut off from from a community and that and uh
sw04130-B_027421-027773 i guess i think that that um
sw04130-B_027907-028329 [noise] research is i guess the most important just because i
sw04130-B_028329-028640 you know it it really needs to come to an end
sw04130-B_028640-028945 yeah
sw04130-B_028945-029352 i don't know i don't know Fish what do you think about that subject
sw04131-A_000000-000084 [noise] personally
sw04131-A_000084-000912 prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to uh to drive kind of fast i guess but i'm finding that as i get older
sw04131-A_000912-001855 i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxu[rious]- luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have
sw04131-A_002026-003197 it's a uh Dodge Daytona it's a Shelby Z they only made them for for one year it's really just a variation on the other Daytonas that they have out but i'm real happy with it
sw04131-A_003197-004089 it's uh an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i heard things about
sw04131-A_004089-005076 uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it
sw04131-A_005896-006033 oh really
sw04131-A_006385-006488 uh
sw04131-A_006619-006958 uh-huh how old is uh how old is the truck
sw04131-A_007282-007394 uh-huh
sw04131-A_008623-008758 um-hum
sw04131-A_009589-009725 uh-huh
sw04131-A_010271-010404 oh
sw04131-A_010809-011411 oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep Wrangler
sw04131-A_011411-012059 and uh it's funny though because it's this is actually my wife's car the Jeep and uh
sw04131-A_012059-012791 but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things
sw04131-A_012791-013202 but we're still finding that when we end up driving other people places that
sw04131-A_013202-013914 it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and
sw04131-A_013914-014434 something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel
sw04131-A_014434-014784 which we do a a fair bit of traveling
sw04131-A_015320-015464 oh yeah
sw04131-A_016195-016371 yeah sure
sw04131-A_016371-016521 it's uh
sw04131-A_016521-017386 i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have
sw04131-A_017386-017499 but
sw04131-A_017913-018756 yeah we haven't had it for very long we got it in September right around uh Labor Day i guess it was and so it doesn't have a whole lot of miles on it yet
sw04131-A_018756-019750 but uh up here in Rochester New York it's nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like [laughter-today] [laughter-where] [laughter-we] [laughter-have] about six inches of snow coming down out there
sw04131-A_020014-021471 yeah i was a little uh surprised to find i i'm not the sort of person that's going to go out and shop for exclusively for an American built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best [laughter-is] [laughter-American]
sw04131-A_021471-021877 made and American built but i was reading in the paper the other day that uh
sw04131-A_021877-023039 surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American aren't always and in fact they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either Mexico or Canada
sw04131-A_023039-024014 which isn't that far away but i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least
sw04131-A_024246-024359 really
sw04131-A_025216-025330 yeah
sw04131-A_025869-026083 no yeah
sw04131-A_026083-026805 yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system uh decoding the vehicle identification number
sw04131-A_026805-027465 so [laughter-you] could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built
sw04131-A_027465-027606 yeah
sw04131-A_027606-027659 but
sw04131-A_027722-027826 it was interesting
sw04131-A_028327-028474 oh really
sw04131-A_028593-028761 oh no [laughter]
sw04131-A_029132-029438 oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it
sw04131-B_000000-000044 [noise]
sw04131-B_001804-002097 um-hum what kind of car do you have right now
sw04131-B_002244-002353 um-hum
sw04131-B_003137-003266 um-hum
sw04131-B_005070-005977 yeah i know my father-in-law has have a has a turbo charged uh engine on his truck and he's had some some problems with that
sw04131-B_005977-006405 but um he put the turbo on himself and uh
sw04131-B_006405-006662 there was some problems right from the start with that
sw04131-B_007007-007362 well i think it's probably about an eighty seven also
sw04131-B_007362-008437 [noise] excuse me but i guess my tastes in vehicles are just a little bit different um um i've been more into just kind of a family car small
sw04131-B_008437-008799 uh not real big car uh
sw04131-B_008799-009660 but lately we've been uh trying to get something that's a little bit more reliable so we've been going with uh Toyota vehicles lately
sw04131-B_009660-010370 and i'm more into pick up trucks lately i i got mys[elf]- uh -[my]self a pick up truck last spring
sw04131-B_010370-010906 and i'm more interested in the the off road that kind of thing hauling things around
sw04131-B_010906-011036 uh
sw04131-B_011340-011462 um-hum
sw04131-B_012729-012888 um-hum
sw04131-B_012888-013055 [noise]
sw04131-B_014391-014664 right [noise]
sw04131-B_014766-015403 yeah i know we do a lot of that ye[ah]- on the road traveling and we we have a Toyota Camry for that kind of traveling
sw04131-B_015403-016180 that's a little bit more comfortable it's it's not real fancy but it's a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles we've had prior to that
sw04131-B_017308-017454 um-hum
sw04131-B_017454-017939 are you pretty satisfied with your Jeep as far as repair and reliability on it
sw04131-B_018715-018839 um-hum
sw04131-B_019423-019559 yeah
sw04131-B_019720-020052 yeah we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so
sw04131-B_021447-021550 um-hum
sw04131-B_023001-023123 yeah
sw04131-B_023967-024610 well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had because_1 the Toyota we have now was built in i think Tennessee
sw04131-B_024610-024799 and the uh
sw04131-B_024799-025490 before that we had a a Volkswagen Jetta which was made in Philadelphia or somewhere in Pennsylvania i think
sw04131-B_025490-026146 so but you wouldn't think that just off the top of your head you'd think they're German or or Japanese made
sw04131-B_027278-027567 yeah i read that in the paper the other day
sw04131-B_027567-027743 found that interesting
sw04131-B_027844-029221 we used to have a Jeep a long time ago when we were first married and i i swore i'd never get one again because_1 we had so many problems with it it was just a a a never ending uh stay at the the repair [laughter-shop] it just
sw04131-B_029383-029456 [noise]
sw04131-B_029456-029984 well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there
sw04132-A_000000-000232 [noise]
sw04132-A_002017-002393 well that's a project [laughter]
sw04132-A_002529-002661 uh-huh
sw04132-A_002960-003718 well we do a lot of our own [noise] repair just we enjoy doing it and
sw04132-A_003718-004459 kind of like you though it's finding the time to do it but oh things like uh
sw04132-A_004459-005835 the inside of the house i always do the i[t]- all the painting in it
sw04132-A_005835-006226 and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be [laughter] quite a job [laughter] since we have a two story house [laughter] [noise]
sw04132-A_006226-006381 and uh
sw04132-A_006618-007566 [noise] well not really we added a room upstairs or finished off a room upstairs
sw04132-A_007566-008268 but that was a [noise] that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh
sw04132-A_008268-008583 it took us a long time
sw04132-A_008583-009040 i mean i'm talking about a year to finish that [laughter]
sw04132-A_009964-010101 uh-huh
sw04132-A_011262-011402 um-hum
sw04132-A_013346-013754 uh-huh the fitting i think is what is [noise]
sw04132-A_013754-014598 took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that um
sw04132-A_014598-015067 uh so we have recently built on a [noise]
sw04132-A_015067-016382 a extra garage to our house and uh [noise] we had a lot of uh well we had the concrete and stuff poured first we didn't attempt that we talked about it but
sw04132-A_016382-016752 decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh
sw04132-A_016752-017901 but we did all the finishing out on it and my husband has a workshop in it [noise] or uh he races cars and we needed a spare [laughter] garage there
sw04132-A_017901-018460 and that turned out to be quite a project uh
sw04132-A_018460-019165 [noise] we're looking at uh a lot of small things to do around the house now like uh
sw04132-A_019165-019542 i think we are on borrowed time on things like the
sw04132-A_019542-020305 hot water heater it's [laughter] that we're gonna change out our self that uh
sw04132-A_020305-020666 i've learned to do some plumbing [laughter]
sw04132-A_020946-021748 well we do because uh we've had one fail and it was quite a mess for us that
sw04132-A_021748-022100 yes and so uh
sw04132-A_022100-022469 we can tell that it's going out because of the
sw04132-A_022469-023206 we're running out of hot water and stuff we'll have some [noise] it's an electric heater and uh
sw04132-A_023206-024307 we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out [noise] and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and
sw04132-A_024307-025104 [noise] and be done with it [laughter] than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before
sw04132-A_025104-025649 and uh and you can get them_1 at discount stores fairly cheap and uh
sw04132-A_025649-026448 [noise] we can do it ours[elves]- it's not that much trouble just unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more [laughter]
sw04132-A_026844-026987 uh-huh
sw04132-A_027977-028355 um-hum well it is time consuming
sw04132-A_028615-028815 oh um-hum
sw04132-B_000000-001047 [noise] see i don't have much time myself for that kind of thing but uh i have my father was uh quite handy he died recently but uh um
sw04132-B_001047-001763 i have done limited [noise] things like for example i've built uh [noise] uh
sw04132-B_001763-002132 tree house for my kids and uh
sw04132-B_002260-002696 i really enjoy doing it i just don't have the time um
sw04132-B_002696-002847 so

sw04132-B_008704-008855 [noise]
sw04132-B_008855-010032 you know it's very interesting my uh father and i built a a home a uh new home for ourselves from basically from the ground up when i was a teenager
sw04132-B_010032-011315 and uh it's amazing how these things work one of my most um am[azing]- amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly
sw04132-B_011315-012115 but then you know comes the inside and the trim and the
sw04132-B_012115-012875 electrical work and [laughter] the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like
sw04132-B_012875-013404 ninety percent of the time it was very frustrating takes a long time to get that house done
sw04132-B_014346-014531 i see yeah
sw04132-B_017847-017967 hm
sw04132-B_019671-019898 um um-hum
sw04132-B_020302-020426 [vocalized-noise]
sw04132-B_020569-020951 [noise] do people change out these things before they fail or
sw04132-B_021532-021857 uh-huh it can cause a lot of damage i know
sw04132-B_024758-024900 um-hum
sw04132-B_026307-027177 [noise] yeah the small those small projects are manageable you know i- i fix toilets and things like that but when it comes to major
sw04132-B_027177-028151 uh projects putting in stairw[ays]- uh in extra stairways or putting on an extra room or something like that i just absolutely do not have the time to do that
sw04132-B_028309-028715 yeah uh the the [vocalized-noise] frustrating thing is that i enjoy doing it
sw04132-B_028715-028982 but um
sw04132-B_028982-029577 you know i work [laughter] twelve hours a day seven days a week as it is so i can't
sw04132-B_029577-029799 just don't have time for
sw04133-A_000000-000176 [noise] so um
sw04133-A_000176-000470 you know my feeling is that uh
sw04133-A_000470-001669 it's really being used today it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
sw04133-A_001669-001813 [vocalized-noise]
sw04133-A_002210-002698 right because y[ou]- you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
sw04133-A_002698-003135 um and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent
sw04133-A_003135-004250 um for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the c[rimes]- crimes that would be eligible you know really care
sw04133-A_004812-005321 right i mean it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know i'm invulnerable i don't need to care about this
sw04133-A_005321-005598 you know i- i- i'm never gonna get caught
sw04133-A_006953-007145 yeah one one way or another
sw04133-A_007259-007774 yeah but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might
sw04133-A_007774-008267 do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself
sw04133-A_008486-008643 well
sw04133-A_008643-009026 y[ou]- you know so that you know the the question is
sw04133-A_009026-010092 you know the other que[stion]- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you gonna do about people who are [laughter-later] found to have been innocent you know there are cases where [vocalized-noise] you know twenty thirty years after the fact they're getting evidence
sw04133-A_010092-010737 especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence and then oops i'm sorry i guess we killed the wrong guy
sw04133-A_010981-011199 [noise]
sw04133-A_011199-012435 [laughter-right] you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned
sw04133-A_012435-012934 i think it is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works
sw04133-A_013735-013908 yeah and you know
sw04133-A_013908-015150 the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush's you know well where are we gonna impose dr[ug]- you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
sw04133-A_015150-015494 and again i don't think these people care they risk their lives everyday
sw04133-A_015618-015726 [vocalized-noise]
sw04133-A_016415-016664 yeah and and you know [noise]
sw04133-A_016664-017486 uh especially you know i live in in Massachusetts you know w[e're]- w[e're]- we're gonna get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
sw04133-A_017486-018628 so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way
sw04133-A_018628-018954 i think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
sw04133-A_018954-019108 because_1 you know
sw04133-A_019342-019701 [noise]
sw04133-A_020494-020914 oh yeah it's mainl[y]- lot of blacks also a lot of young people
sw04133-A_020914-021351 you know your a a [vocalized-noise] a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be
sw04133-A_021351-021651 put on death row from what i've seen
sw04133-A_021651-022334 and you know i- i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things
sw04133-A_022334-023091 they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it i mean
sw04133-A_023091-023846 [vocalized-noise] my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever or if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh
sw04133-A_023846-024519 to the victim's family the only thing that should really i mean obviously if someone of mine who was close died i'd probably feel differently but
sw04133-A_024519-025014 you know th[e]- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
sw04133-A_025699-025865 right i mean the
sw04133-A_026190-026641 right and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh
sw04133-A_026641-027082 genome human genome research and now more and more things like schizophrenia
sw04133-A_027082-028312 and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to Jeff Dahmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
sw04133-A_028312-028895 you know you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions
sw04133-A_029393-029642 society made me do it yeah
sw04133-B_000000-000094 [noise]
sw04133-B_001652-002361 right i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
sw04133-B_002631-002749 right
sw04133-B_004209-004892 well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or
sw04133-B_005325-005447 yeah but
sw04133-B_005598-006306 yeah but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahmer
sw04133-B_006306-006420 do you want
sw04133-B_006420-006976 by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again
sw04133-B_006976-007405 whereas if you kill him [noise] there is not that possibility
sw04133-B_008195-008710 yeah i don't think he could ever redeem himself but in some cases yes
sw04133-B_009691-009803 yeah
sw04133-B_010702-011274 yeah it's it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it
sw04133-B_012829-013751 oh yeah yeah it's a[ll]- the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused
sw04133-B_015112-015238 right
sw04133-B_015597-016179 yeah that there there they see that the profit margin of drug dealers the profit margin's so high
sw04133-B_016179-016474 that yeah the the risk is almost not there
sw04133-B_017435-017543 yeah
sw04133-B_018888-019680 yeah well it's also i used to live in Georgia and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment
sw04133-B_019680-020265 but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed
sw04133-B_020265-020741 it's very racially related and ethnically related
sw04133-B_021539-021659 right
sw04133-B_024453-024569 right
sw04133-B_024959-025742 right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution
sw04133-B_025742-026272 you you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family
sw04133-B_026807-026939 um-hum
sw04133-B_027296-027414 right
sw04133-B_028258-028387 uh-huh
sw04133-B_028873-029421 yeah well i- i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions i never like the uh
sw04133-B_029421-029847 the defense that well i never liked the uh insanity defense
sw04134-A_000000-000041 [noise]
sw04134-A_000041-001130 well i've recently dropped my subscription to the local paper well not exactly local it's a pretty big one the Atlanta Journal Constitution because i was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper
sw04134-A_001130-001696 was really pretty poor and i couldn't see spending half an hour a day looking through that
sw04134-A_002348-003049 yeah i try and watch the news as well we get uh cable here and watch Headline news but it's such a
sw04134-A_003049-003750 i don't know there's really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than uh
sw04134-A_003750-004269 you know pass on any real information it's pretty trashy i'm not happy with it
sw04134-A_005148-005299 uh
sw04134-A_005299-006673 the i think more the uh the just the the real lack of meat behind it i think there was an article in some local news magazine recently that mentioned it [vocalized-noise] talked about the uh uh level of
sw04134-A_006673-007798 uh reading ability or something or other and things like President Bush's uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old uh
sw04134-A_007798-009050 the the last election nonsense and they were talking about how Dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while Bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that
sw04134-A_009050-009484 uh being able to convey to that lar[ger]- much larger of an audience you know he
sw04134-A_009484-010600 was supposedly that much more an effective communicator and i think that's the same problem with the news is they're trying to communicate with maybe so many people that it's just coming out really pretty poor
sw04134-A_011747-011899 um
sw04134-A_012199-012402 yeah i agree
sw04134-A_013350-013532 uh-huh
sw04134-A_013727-014397 yeah that's like uh trying to maintain a temperature in your house by running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time
sw04134-A_016569-016725 yeah
sw04134-A_018454-018676 yeah they are good
sw04134-A_018676-019848 i'm surprised at the the the range and quality of things that are out there like Scientific American there's such a broad uh spectrum of science and yet it's really in depth at the same time
sw04134-A_021695-021944 yeah and national
sw04134-A_023048-023273 held by the same company
sw04134-A_023273-024499 yeah i agree we recently had Newsweek at the house but went ahead and dropped it decided it really wasn't what we were looking for and we started subscription to U S News And World Report but it hasn't started arrived yet
sw04134-A_024499-025249 going to try and evaluate that you know another interesting source of news is the is E-mail the network news do you get that
sw04134-A_025449-026348 yeah me too i really if if i when i move when i go to my next job i'm really going to be uh upset if i don't have access to that
sw04134-A_027995-028426 oh that's cheap and you get to call in across a modem
sw04134-A_028426-028550 oh
sw04134-A_028650-028777 man
sw04134-A_029401-029840 excellent yeah that really seems to be a a one of the cutting leading
sw04134-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04134-B_001700-002446 yeah i did the same thing actually i uh don't have a i'm not subscribing anymore
sw04134-B_004105-004900 are you unhappy with the uh with the how should i say it uh
sw04134-B_005100-005493 the one-sidedness of it or or the
sw04134-B_010549-010977 my my problem is that they just don't uh
sw04134-B_010977-011849 how should i say it i i can either get uh things on one side or the other but not uh a meaningful discussion
sw04134-B_011849-012300 that relates to well how should i say i either get these highly polarized things
sw04134-B_012300-012749 and sometimes they're i say okay we're going to we're going to do uh
sw04134-B_012749-012899 uh
sw04134-B_013002-013902 we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized articles which which is uh better than than one but uh
sw04134-B_014299-014674 so uh anyway so we're uh
sw04134-B_014674-015099 one of the problems the other problem that i have is that that uh
sw04134-B_015099-015599 as you said uh a lot of the articles are they're either fluff
sw04134-B_015699-016292 uh well actually out of the press they're they're fluff or they're uh
sw04134-B_016403-016650 pretty shallow but
sw04134-B_016650-016700 [noise]
sw04134-B_016700-017400 course i h[ave]- i also have the option and i guess you do too of signing up for one of these
sw04134-B_017400-018048 uh uh specialty magazines which is like in the case of uh
sw04134-B_018048-018377 science you know you sign up for
sw04134-B_018377-018525 uh
sw04134-B_018525-018773 Nature or something like that but
sw04134-B_019798-020599 but when it comes to news uh it's a i find it i i think the reason perhaps for that is that the uh
sw04134-B_020701-021227 the uh press like everything else is is becoming a
sw04134-B_021227-021477 uh how should i say is becoming
sw04134-B_021582-021880 they're not neighborhood uh press anymore
sw04134-B_021880-022947 they're worried more they're more like U S A Today type things uh pretty shallow and and can we make it uh and they're run by you have ten newspapers that are run by uh
sw04134-B_023050-023149 uh
sw04134-B_023149-023249 [noise]
sw04134-B_023249-023347 yeah
sw04134-B_024997-025549 oh yeah that's yes that's one of the most inter[esting]- that's how i found out about this
sw04134-B_025999-026354 [laughter]
sw04134-B_026354-026749 well there are some places here in town uh for people that are
sw04134-B_026749-026920 uh
sw04134-B_026920-027499 having uh withdrawal pains so to speak uh there's a bookstore that has a uh
sw04134-B_027499-028221 uh subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a a year which is pretty small potatoes
sw04134-B_028375-029248 yeah call in on the modem and you can read your news and i mean read your mail and uh and uh look at the all the different internet uh
sw04134-B_029248-029450 uh groups
sw04135-A_000000-000018 [noise]
sw04135-A_000018-000598 um so what is your wh[at]- why do you think people don't vote in the elections
sw04135-A_001527-001674 uh-huh
sw04135-A_002649-002819 yeah
sw04135-A_003848-005124 yeah yeah i i think i think apathy is is real big thing i mean just in the fact that you don't think you're going to have anything done i to me it's really hard to find um
sw04135-A_005124-005850 any information on the candidates i mean i- i voted yesterday and and uh
sw04135-A_005850-007004 h[alf]- half the people you know you really have to hunt to get information on them and you know as far as the local things go and if you know if you don't know them_1 then
sw04135-A_007951-008098 really
sw04135-A_008299-008429 yeah
sw04135-A_008429-008629 that's a good idea
sw04135-A_008975-009099 yeah
sw04135-A_011296-011495 huh-uh huh-uh
sw04135-A_012300-012449 uh-huh
sw04135-A_014047-014232 yeah
sw04135-A_014800-016047 yeah i that's um i don't know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church that uh it it asked uh
sw04135-A_016047-016799 it went all the way dow[n]- well it went to some of our constables but mainly it was in the Dallas area not in the Plano area
sw04135-A_016799-017774 but um it asked it had all sorts of questions about uh economics uh education and and uh
sw04135-A_017774-017921 uh
sw04135-A_017921-018196 family and
sw04135-A_018299-019075 yeah yeah but it had other things like um do you would you support um
sw04135-A_019075-019800 i know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was was would you support um a a two thousand dollar uh
sw04135-A_019800-020609 tax credit for women that stay you know at home and and so it had kind of a variety of of um
sw04135-A_020609-021034 of questions and it wa[s]- it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it
sw04135-A_021034-022100 it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know supp[ort]- if they could support opp[ose]- oppose or or you know be undecided about it
sw04135-A_022100-023503 yeah it was it was it was uh i thought it was really good but you know it course it doesn't go through all the candidates and some of them_1 you know you think well this guy's this guy won't have any won't have any um
sw04135-A_023503-024754 say so about any of this anyway but it's kind of good to know their opinions anyway they you know run for a different kind of office so i think once you're in politics you probably stay in politics i would think
sw04135-A_026645-026770 yeah
sw04135-A_027848-028476 uh-huh and that may have been who had done it i'm i don't remember um
sw04135-A_028476-029599 i- i had like three or four different things i was looking at uh and that was [vocalized-noise] that that was probably the most helpful i wish it had been more detailed i know that um
sw04135-A_029700-029818 i y[ou]-
sw04135-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04135-B_000450-001867 well first of all i think they understated the turnout it's i don't i don't think that in a national election it's ever been under fifty three percent well it's it's it's almost half but it's been you know it's somewhere in the fifties for sure so it it u[nderstates]- it understates it a little bit
sw04135-B_001867-002750 why do people not vote um well it's [laughter] the analysts usually say they don't think it will effect anything they're certainly wrong about that
sw04135-B_002750-003945 um i think that that it's easy if you if if you think things are going bad enough to just turn off to the news and just not pay any attention It's the less you pay attention the less you know about what's going to effect you
sw04135-B_004670-004776 uh-huh
sw04135-B_005597-005701 uh-huh
sw04135-B_006184-006324 yeah
sw04135-B_006700-006834 oh yeah
sw04135-B_006935-008044 that's right yeah and i i i agree uh i have made calls to various organizations the night before elections well one thing i d[o]- [laughter] i usually do is go to the library and study for an election [laughter] before it
sw04135-B_008044-008549 yeah and and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things and that helps a little bit
sw04135-B_008549-009309 they don't ask their they don't ask enough questions they ask on one or two issues and and m[any]- people can respond with platitudes
sw04135-B_009309-010675 what you really need to do [noise] excuse me is find interest groups that that you know who's inter[est]- whose issues you are interested in and then find how the if they have done a candidate survey and lots of times they have and then you have something to base it on
sw04135-B_010675-011386 there was a back when i was living in Pittsburgh there was a group called the association for public justice i don't know if you've ever heard of them per[haps]-
sw04135-B_011386-012385 perhaps not i- it's it's it th[ey]- they they really didn't you know it it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too
sw04135-B_012385-013160 and they put out this this [vocalized-noise] uh survey of candidates where they asked them like uh eight questions uh all the candidates for all the offices
sw04135-B_013160-014209 now it wasn't that great in that they didn't tailor the the the question for you know for the particular office so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at the national level and vice versa
sw04135-B_014209-014900 but uh other than that it was a very good way to to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that
sw04135-B_015566-015679 uh-huh
sw04135-B_016549-016675 uh-huh
sw04135-B_017399-017523 [vocalized-noise]
sw04135-B_018051-018427 th[ings]- things things like abortion presumably
sw04135-B_018749-018872 huh
sw04135-B_019928-020074 yeah right
sw04135-B_020178-020276 right
sw04135-B_021247-021370 uh-huh
sw04135-B_021799-021930 i
sw04135-B_021930-022150 d[o]- do you know what group did it

sw04135-B_023298-023448 uh-huh
sw04135-B_023848-023978 uh-huh
sw04135-B_024100-024395 that's right because y[eah]- yeah i mean once they
sw04135-B_024649-025895 yeah that's right that's that's one point that was made that that you know uh i i read one article saying even if you don't think that abortion makes any difference at uh you know at a at a really local level like City Council or something like that
sw04135-B_025895-026727 these people will in the end they might get elected to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected these li[ttle]- to these to little offices
sw04135-B_026727-028049 so you got to look at their views and and that was a point that i hadn't considered the reason i ask about the organization is i just got uh started working last year in an organization called Christian Coalition which does just what you were suggesting and i was wondering if it was
sw04135-B_028049-028277 if it was theirs yeah
sw04135-B_028850-028970 uh-huh
sw04135-B_029399-029818 [laughter] see the candidates don't like to respond to all these questions
sw04136-A_000000-000100 [noise] so uh
sw04136-A_000100-000351 whe[re]- where do you -[g]et your current events
sw04136-A_000351-000449 [vocalized-noise]
sw04136-A_000599-000853 okay [laughter]
sw04136-A_001352-001547 [laughter]
sw04136-A_001898-002100 [laughter]
sw04136-A_002647-003000 uh-huh um do you watch any television
sw04136-A_003250-003352 oh
sw04136-A_003700-003848 uh-huh huh
sw04136-A_004401-004522 uh-huh
sw04136-A_005180-005329 uh-huh
sw04136-A_005900-006121 [laughter]
sw04136-A_006121-006649 well um i used to read the whole paper every day
sw04136-A_006649-007623 and uh when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and you're like you want to talk to people about
sw04136-A_007623-008654 so what do you think about the situation in West Pakistan [laughter] like this the parliamentary government's not g[oing]- not you know not going to stay in there and people sort of stare at you uh
sw04136-A_008654-009129 but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day
sw04136-A_009129-009219 [laughter]
sw04136-A_009219-010399 um and i sort of glance at the front page uh i also used to listen to um public radio
sw04136-A_010399-011799 tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh
sw04136-A_011799-012103 now i listen to the radio
sw04136-A_012103-013148 maybe five minutes in the morning and i don't get to listen evening some i'm pretty pretty uninformed uh but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio
sw04136-A_013148-013297 uh
sw04136-A_013599-014499 uh-huh [laughter] yeah oh that was the other thing i used to drive to work i used to have a long commute and i would listen to every morning on uh
sw04136-A_014499-014950 public radio there's a show called Morning Edition that lasts an hour and a half and
sw04136-A_014950-016152 they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus um
sw04136-A_016152-016424 i i miss that
sw04136-A_016424-016545 uh
sw04136-A_016649-017549 the uh the well during the during the Gulf War we turned on the TV a couple times did you wa[tch]- watch any more during that
sw04136-A_017549-017726 yeah
sw04136-A_017726-017930 the whole Iraq thing
sw04136-A_018199-018326 uh-huh
sw04136-A_018500-018649 um-hum
sw04136-A_018850-019000 um-hum
sw04136-A_019149-019349 oh yeah i'll bet [laughter]
sw04136-A_019949-020276 oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah
sw04136-A_020674-021067 yeah yeah there's so much to know it is amazing
sw04136-A_021067-021198 um
sw04136-A_021198-022534 well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh
sw04136-A_022534-023721 i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything
sw04136-A_023721-024125 you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh
sw04136-A_024125-024501 like i i got more visual information but less
sw04136-A_024501-024748 real information in a way
sw04136-A_025100-025224 uh-huh
sw04136-A_025450-025676 yeah and it's almost as though
sw04136-A_025676-026071 that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it
sw04136-A_026071-027402 you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate
sw04136-A_027402-027799 uh i think [vocalized-noise] in part at least because they had to
sw04136-A_027799-028805 uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling
sw04136-A_029299-029725 ri[ght]- it's it's an interesting question about
sw04136-A_029725-029930 you know the bandwidth of the telev[ision]-
sw04136-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04136-B_000300-000821 i'm i don't keep up on current events very well at all [laughter]
sw04136-B_000821-002022 what i what i do on my i keep up on current events by as i walk by the newspaper stand if there is a headline that grabs my attention then i will stand there and look at it for a minute then walk into my office
sw04136-B_002022-002751 maybe once every six months i'll i'll find something that's interesting enough that i'll buy the paper and then usually i r[ead]- end up reading a lot of it
sw04136-B_003000-003749 uh no oh yeah i do i watch i watch Star Trek and sometimes i watch the Equalizer i never watch the news
sw04136-B_003749-004048 my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes i'll get
sw04136-B_004048-005269 get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and uh sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport i'll i'll be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and i'll read parts of it
sw04136-B_005269-006197 but uh i don't make any deliberate effort to keep up on current events i probably about one of the least informed people [laughter] around how about you
sw04136-B_006579-006728 wow
sw04136-B_008775-008945 uh-huh
sw04136-B_009149-009325 [laughter]
sw04136-B_010698-010896 uh-huh
sw04136-B_013148-013649 yeah we have a news station here that i listen to sometimes on the way to work but it's a short drive
sw04136-B_014077-014199 uh-huh
sw04136-B_014822-014948 um-hum
sw04136-B_015699-015849 wow
sw04136-B_017497-017700 in the Gulf War
sw04136-B_017700-018280 uh that i have to say that during the Gulf War yeah i watched a lot of CNN
sw04136-B_018280-018921 i really did uh because_1 i was pretty interested in that and i have a a an Iranian roommate
sw04136-B_018921-019199 and uh so he had on constantly
sw04136-B_019199-019362 [laughter]
sw04136-B_019362-020049 and uh so and actually i learned a lot from him about world situations and also i have a bunch of Persian friends because of him and so
sw04136-B_020171-020772 yeah and they are always telling me about countries i have never heard of and polit[ical]- political situations that totally amaze me
sw04136-B_020772-020946 and so
sw04136-B_024448-024727 less content
sw04136-B_024727-025449 they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was was military clips and
sw04136-B_026029-026344 yeah well they have to show something
sw04136-B_028498-028746 i never thought about that
sw04136-B_028746-029449 the information per hour well technically the information on the TV is higher but the actual content is less
sw04137-A_000000-000824 [noise] let's see mine's pretty easy actually uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns
sw04137-A_000824-001301 um and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one
sw04137-A_001551-001665 well
sw04137-A_001665-002228 no regardless of that fact it's the best car in the class for the be[st]- cheapest amount of money
sw04137-A_002228-003494 i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little auto cross racing uh closed circuit racing and uh it seems to just blow the com[petition]- compe[tition]- competition away
sw04137-A_003494-004218 handling power everything yeah it just got like the top rating it was compared up against uh
sw04137-A_004218-004391 let's see
sw04137-A_004391-004636 there was like the Mazda
sw04137-A_004636-005231 M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand
sw04137-A_005231-005422 the Civic S I
sw04137-A_005422-006700 and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
sw04137-A_006849-007250 Mustang GTs uh can't afford it
sw04137-A_007500-007831 right yeah i'm a graduate student [vocalized-noise]
sw04137-A_007831-008074 let's face it i don't make any money so
sw04137-A_008074-008219 [laughter]
sw04137-A_008449-008591 yeah
sw04137-A_008591-008774 yeah we'll see then
sw04137-A_008774-009250 yeah right now i'm stuck i i've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo
sw04137-A_009250-010108 that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn
sw04137-A_010346-010882 oh yeah i'd do it i'd use it for both the nice thing about auto crossing is you can you can do both
sw04137-A_011094-011250 uh just like a um
sw04137-A_011351-011501 um
sw04137-A_011501-011923 set up a lot of times and it's like really large uh parking lots
sw04137-A_011923-012192 and pylons and things
sw04137-A_012192-012730 tight turns hard acceleration i've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete
sw04137-A_012730-012852 and
sw04137-A_012852-013257 it's interesting they get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class
sw04137-A_013257-013353 yeah
sw04137-A_013528-013746 uh what are you thinking about buying
sw04137-A_015150-015296 the Legend
sw04137-A_015296-015399 uh
sw04137-A_015751-015856 uh-huh
sw04137-A_016579-016695 [laughter]
sw04137-A_016695-016822 [laughter-yeah]
sw04137-A_017179-018242 yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the BMW's are produced in uh [vocalized-noise] uh Stuttgart and uh and Munich and i was i was there this uh summer
sw04137-A_018242-019101 i i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for BMW
sw04137-A_019656-020002 [laughter]
sw04137-A_020002-020190 yeah uh
sw04137-A_020609-021887 [laughter-oh] of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
sw04137-A_021887-022072 yeah the uh [noise]
sw04137-A_022072-022843 yeah the uh the BMW is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and
sw04137-A_022843-023728 and then you go to Porsche and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike
sw04137-A_023728-023880 [laughter]
sw04137-A_023880-024728 and so it's like completely opposed i don't know which do i like better i think i like [laughter-the] Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
sw04137-A_024728-025004 unless it's it's a toy
sw04137-A_025004-025151 let's face it
sw04137-A_025282-025901 yeah yeah but it it BMW's good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
sw04137-A_026501-026688 wow yeah
sw04137-A_026688-026839 that's cool
sw04137-A_027041-027346 yeah that's good i also i was impressed by uh
sw04137-A_027346-027554 by the Mercedes too
sw04137-A_027554-027972 i really i really like the Mercedes the factory was nice and
sw04137-A_028408-028703 and is it different for the for the BMW
sw04137-A_029149-029299 probably
sw04137-A_029600-029836 right [laughter] i [laughter] can imagine that
sw04137-B_000000-000750 [noise]
sw04137-B_000750-000886 uh-huh
sw04137-B_001263-001536 oh really you like uh so you're an American
sw04137-B_001536-001733 you want to buy American
sw04137-B_002947-003048 um
sw04137-B_003363-003744 in terms of handling uh acceleration
sw04137-B_006574-006927 what about Mustang GTs
sw04137-B_007182-007626 those so you're talking about ones in a lower lower end p[rice]- price range
sw04137-B_008007-008149 right
sw04137-B_008149-008489 well you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want
sw04137-B_008489-008623 [laughter]
sw04137-B_010062-010452 right would you use that for city driving and racing
sw04137-B_010855-011152 auto crossing is what kind of track is that
sw04137-B_011838-012244 okay and you put up set up the track pylons okay
sw04137-B_013181-013452 oh really yeah i would guess so
sw04137-B_013695-014617 uh i think i'd like to get uh BMW or if i go the German route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but
sw04137-B_014617-015247 uh or maybe a Hon[da]- i mean a a Acura Legend
sw04137-B_015247-015525 uh a Lexus
sw04137-B_015525-015831 uh S C three hundred maybe
sw04137-B_015831-016606 something on that order i haven't really determined if i like the the Japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one
sw04137-B_016752-017229 you know because your BMWs your German cars have good reputations i think
sw04137-B_017893-018023 yes
sw04137-B_018813-018927 the
sw04137-B_019034-019703 yeah they their they have the whole philosophy i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better
sw04137-B_019703-019933 which is kind of hard to take [laughter]
sw04137-B_020048-020704 i mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of [laughter] they're trying to brainwash you too
sw04137-B_021816-021974 oh really
sw04137-B_023384-023521 um
sw04137-B_023656-023875 [laughter]
sw04137-B_023875-023992 yeah that's
sw04137-B_024599-024808 no it's not realistic
sw04137-B_024997-025312 yeah if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess so
sw04137-B_025312-025427 [laughter]
sw04137-B_025778-026564 yeah just work short trips no m[ileage]- no heavy mileage i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year
sw04137-B_026564-026754 so it's pretty minimal
sw04137-B_026754-027074 lasts a long time that's mainly what i'm looking for
sw04137-B_027486-027634 oh yeah
sw04137-B_027752-027856 but
sw04137-B_027856-028539 but if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things [laughter]
sw04137-B_028664-029367 uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different once you get up in the five series and higher then
sw04137-B_029367-029685 all your repair costs go up [laughter-significantly] [noise]
sw04137-B_029685-029952 so i'm ki[nd]- yeah i'm not sure if i really want
sw04138-A_000000-000056 [noise] think about
sw04138-A_000056-000192 uh taxes
sw04138-A_001170-001347 you spend what you have and
sw04138-A_001551-001740 yeah i think that
sw04138-A_001740-002089 the general idea is to s[pend]- you know spend uh
sw04138-A_002089-002857 during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they're running under the assump[tion]- you know
sw04138-A_002857-004129 the way they're running it now they're h[ave]- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so
sw04138-A_004129-004988 that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe
sw04138-A_004988-005806 so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay f[or]- you know get what you pay for
sw04138-A_007216-007448 yeah [vocalized-noise] there's
sw04138-A_008297-008390 uh-huh
sw04138-A_008748-008938 i agree with that
sw04138-A_010492-010940 i guess i'm a i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and
sw04138-A_010940-011639 so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh
sw04138-A_011639-012409 compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored i go to a state sponsored school
sw04138-A_012409-013711 and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long my parents i guess h[owever]- h[owever]- however have
sw04138-A_013711-014984 contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back i will this year anyway from
sw04138-A_014984-015397 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-i] [laughter-am] i need it too otherwise things
sw04138-A_015758-015900 uh-huh
sw04138-A_016871-017015 uh-huh
sw04138-A_017666-017870 more taxes you pay
sw04138-A_018397-018632 uh-huh isn't
sw04138-A_019293-019454 uh-huh
sw04138-A_020243-020365 uh-huh
sw04138-A_021054-021155 wow
sw04138-A_021703-021801 uh-huh
sw04138-A_022065-022170 well isn't
sw04138-A_022893-023143 uh-huh there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes
sw04138-A_023382-023440 uh-huh
sw04138-A_023517-023773 the taxes that people don't think about that
sw04138-A_023773-024299 yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess
sw04138-A_024557-024663 uh-huh
sw04138-A_024663-025928 there was that which can[didates]- was it Jerry Brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a f[lat]- i think a flat percentage something like that
sw04138-A_027974-028078 uh-huh
sw04138-A_028651-028785 right
sw04138-A_028888-029220 exactly that's because up until like eight
sw04138-A_029220-029437 [laughter]
sw04138-A_029437-029609 [laughter]
sw04138-A_029609-029891 up until like eighty five or something was
sw04138-A_029891-029946 the
sw04138-B_000000-000215 [noise]
sw04138-B_000215-001252 well i think they're a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh
sw04138-B_001252-001737 you you don't spend more than you than you bring in
sw04138-B_005840-007256 well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living
sw04138-B_007256-008329 [laughter-so] i think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants
sw04138-B_008329-008845 uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society
sw04138-B_008845-009611 but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that
sw04138-B_009611-010501 the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
sw04138-B_014863-015775 uh you're very fortunate [laughter] we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh
sw04138-B_015775-016883 we don't regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
sw04138-B_016883-017821 and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money [noise] and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
sw04138-B_017821-018466 it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
sw04138-B_018466-018897 uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the
sw04138-B_018897-019384 nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one
sw04138-B_019384-020428 uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
sw04138-B_020428-021072 and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
sw04138-B_021072-021524 now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every
sw04138-B_021524-021744 for every item on there
sw04138-B_021744-022050 even though there's uh taxes on different things
sw04138-B_022050-022875 but you know there's f[ederal]- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax
sw04138-B_023090-023552 you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank
sw04138-B_024259-024620 but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
sw04138-B_025903-026771 if you impl[emented]- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what
sw04138-B_026771-027957 people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
sw04138-B_027957-028941 and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs
sw04138-B_028941-029446 and so based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer
sw04138-B_029446-029946 [laughter]
sw04139-A_000000-000022 [noise]
sw04139-A_000022-000448 so uh how you how do you find out what's going on
sw04139-A_000448-000649 [laughter]

sw04139-A_017878-019239 and that that pretty much gives you gives me an idea what's going on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what what's happened in like the past week
sw04139-A_019239-019604 but that's about the only newspaper that i really listen to
sw04139-A_020449-020849 [laughter]
sw04139-A_020849-021499 so you end well you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway on the on the way out huh
sw04139-A_021649-022348 well one of the things that i i can't do is i just can't find the time to read the paper all that much it just
sw04139-A_022348-022823 [vocalized-noise] if i were to if i were to it would take like what half hour a day
sw04139-A_022823-023175 to to to find the time to read the paper
sw04139-A_023175-024401 and that's why i like the radio the best es[pecially]- especially in the car because i when i'm in the car and i'm on my way to work there's nothing else i can do other than like watch the road [laughter-you] [laughter-know]

sw04139-B_000549-000800 well uh

sw04139-B_022749-022925 oh yeah
sw04139-B_024051-024202 yeah
sw04139-B_024302-024524 i've gotten into some uh
sw04139-B_024524-024723 you know we have a uh
sw04139-B_024723-024949 news service on our uh
sw04139-B_024949-025249 network here on the computer
sw04139-B_025400-026478 well we have that at at lunch in the cafeteria but we also have uh one that you pull up on your screen you know we have a computer network here at TI that you can go to uh
sw04139-B_026478-026699 Dallas and get the national
sw04139-B_026801-027450 they have a Dow Jones segment there where it covers us uh you know some most active stocks uh general average
sw04139-B_028449-028597 uh
sw04139-B_028849-029049 [laughter]
sw04139-B_029379-029799 yeah that's actual that DJNS i guess
sw04140-A_000000-000138 [noise]
sw04140-A_000138-000816 from this from the scale of one to ten i- i lean more towards no restriction
sw04140-A_000816-001483 we by the constitution we have the the right to bear arms and
sw04140-A_001483-002183 i believe our freedoms are being constantly eroded all the time and
sw04140-A_002183-002866 President Bush just signed a law that that banned
sw04140-A_002866-003457 lot of automatic weapons and and such where they wouldn't do any more damage than
sw04140-A_003457-003900 some Winchester rifles or things like that what do you think about that
sw04140-A_011848-013080 well that's a that's a [vocalized-noise] that's a good point also we have to we have to be c[ognizant]- cognizant that our society's becoming more and more haves and have nots
sw04140-A_013080-014240 and the main the main purpose say for the police is to keep the have nots from taking from the haves and that is the purposes o[f]- of the gun control
sw04140-A_017942-019250 oh i- i- i agree i my point was that the police want to get rid rid of the people of of guns and what's happening is that i see i- i- i view this country as as as we have
sw04140-A_019250-019981 peoples and societies and cultures and things that are be o[ppressed]- that are oppressed and so that to
sw04140-A_019981-020928 to take the way the those weapons so they can protect themselves is that's what the means and that's what they're they're trying to do and by enacting all this legislation
sw04140-A_025451-025695 that's true yeah
sw04140-A_026387-027286 well you know i another perspective is that the people in this country i'll just for not lack of a better word i'll say they're spoiled
sw04140-A_027286-028670 they haven't been except for the immigrants have come to this country they're not cognizant of war and and chaos and terrorism like Lebanon or countries that have been invaded
sw04140-A_028670-029946 and if our country needs if our country's invaded we need the people to to rise i mean the the military and the police isn't going to do it all for us and i[f]- and if we don't have the the g[overment]-
sw04140-B_000000-003851 [noise]
sw04140-B_003851-004770 well i pretty much agree with you uh i wouldn't say that i'm a ten because i do think that there are some types of weapons that
sw04140-B_004770-005780 should be restricted because of their extreme potential to uh [noise] uh to produce collateral damage if you know what i mean
sw04140-B_005780-006715 i don't think that people should have nuclear weapons in their homes or or biological weapons but i'm probably uh on a scale of ten i'm a i'm a nine
sw04140-B_006715-007337 in that i think that any any arm that can easily be carried by hand
sw04140-B_007337-008660 should certainly be uh protected for individuals to own and uh to use uh in particular i'll express my opinion on this uh this there's there's some people that think that
sw04140-B_008660-009577 the second amendment is you know only a collective right that it applies to the militia i don't believe that i think it it applies to individuals
sw04140-B_009577-010798 uh also uh i don't think that the our founding fathers had anything in mind anything to do with hunting or even defense against criminals or
sw04140-B_010798-011873 or target shooting what they had in mind was that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from the government becoming too strong and taking away our liberties
sw04140-B_014240-015421 well the thing [vocalized-noise] with the police is that they're only good to pick up the pieces after the crime has happened we have to to take precautions to defend ourselves
sw04140-B_015421-016480 uh if someone comes after you with a gun there's no way that the police are going to stop them uh even if you have an opportunity to call the police uh because someone has threatened you
sw04140-B_016480-017126 they won't come out and protect you all they can do is investigate a crime after it's been committed it's very rare that they prevent one
sw04140-B_017126-017945 so it's important that we each as individuals have the means to protect ourselves and in this day and age that means having guns
sw04140-B_020835-022157 i- i agree with you i think that uh [noise] although to to a large degree what the the politicians are doing is just responding or reflecting
sw04140-B_022157-023345 what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for
sw04140-B_023345-024278 and all they see is rampant crime in the streets and they think that banning guns is going to stop that but that's that's simply not the case uh
sw04140-B_024278-025212 you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but
sw04140-B_025212-026531 i[f]- if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns they're not going to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from from getting uh guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of of crime
sw04141-A_000050-000266 so what kind of animals do you have
sw04141-A_000373-000499 uh
sw04141-A_001348-001500 uh-huh
sw04141-A_002900-003126 [laughter]
sw04141-A_003227-003479 yeah i have a dog and a cat
sw04141-A_003479-004873 so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning uh the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old and it it was a hefty break in [laughter]
sw04141-A_005199-006497 well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh
sw04141-A_006497-007899 luckily it's sort of a big cat i mean it's about twelve pounds and uh so he can hold his own against the dog and uh but they they i basically got the cat to keep the dog company and uh they they do that [laughter]
sw04141-A_008249-008350 uh-huh
sw04141-A_008350-008500 [laughter]
sw04141-A_009448-009631 [laughter]
sw04141-A_009631-009769 yeah
sw04141-A_009881-010472 well i'll tell you one thing i found with with pets um i- i think cats
sw04141-A_010472-011650 are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know it's a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing
sw04141-A_011650-012249 and sometimes i think wow if i had two cats i'd just you know get a feeder [laughter] and
sw04141-A_012797-013100 [laughter]
sw04141-A_013600-013771 oh that's amazing
sw04141-A_013771-013897 [laughter]
sw04141-A_014579-014899 [laughter]
sw04141-A_014899-015100 [laughter]
sw04141-A_015277-015421 yeah
sw04141-A_015524-015800 [laughter]
sw04141-A_015800-016275 that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but uh
sw04141-A_016275-017321 yeah we've been uh we've been pretty lucky too the uh reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in school still and i lived uh closer to campus
sw04141-A_017321-017800 and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren't that nice
sw04141-A_017800-018945 and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and th[e]- but the people on either side of us were [laughter] so yeah uh
sw04141-A_019500-019648 [laughter]
sw04141-A_019927-020080 [laughter]
sw04141-A_020181-020449 [laughter]
sw04141-A_020551-020699 yeah yeah
sw04141-A_020699-020900 [laughter]
sw04141-A_020900-021576 uh she's uh around fifty pounds she's a a very very skinny shepherd [laughter]
sw04141-A_021576-021956 uh well she's not pure and
sw04141-A_021956-023026 w[e]- we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but uh she looks like she's crossed with like Greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and uh
sw04141-A_023920-024650 [noise] yeah definitely and they're also prone to more diseases and uh skin problems and
sw04141-A_024650-025952 my sister has a a pure bred gold uh yellow Lab and that dog has every [laughter-problem] you could imagine you know it's allergic to fleas it's uh got another skin condition and just
sw04141-A_025952-026278 yeah yeah [laughter]
sw04141-A_026278-027410 so w[e]- we haven't really had much problems with her she's uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so
sw04141-A_027410-027787 it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs
sw04141-A_027787-027893 [laughter]
sw04141-A_027893-028299 trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you
sw04141-A_028401-028699 so yeah yeah either
sw04141-A_029548-029693 right
sw04141-B_000000-000076 [noise] recording
sw04141-B_000179-000448 well i have two cats
sw04141-B_000448-001426 i have two cats because i can't have dogs um where i live i i've wanted a dog i owned a d[og]- we had dogs when i was growing up all the time
sw04141-B_001426-002216 and um you know our our cats are are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this is a
sw04141-B_002216-003016 uh it's been a really really n[eat]- uh neat kind of learning experience for me they've blown all my uh con[ceptions]- preconceptions about cats
sw04141-B_003016-003297 so do you do you have pets
sw04141-B_003400-003599 uh-oh do they get along
sw04141-B_004000-004148 uh-huh
sw04141-B_004724-005250 oh did the dog the dog like uh know that there was a cat and
sw04141-B_005974-006148 hum
sw04141-B_006766-006924 [laughter]
sw04141-B_007523-007623 yeah
sw04141-B_007623-007775 [laughter]
sw04141-B_007775-008319 yeah that's that's actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet
sw04141-B_008319-009502 uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it's a cat
sw04141-B_009502-009899 so it works out pretty well um
sw04141-B_010847-010999 uh-huh
sw04141-B_011101-011251 yeah
sw04141-B_011576-011777 feed them and all that
sw04141-B_012000-012909 uh yeah you know an interesting story is i- i- i have a friend who has um a cat that actually knows how to open Tender Vittles bags
sw04141-B_012909-013697 so if they [laughter-go] on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the cat'll go and open one when it wants to eat
sw04141-B_013697-014979 i'm i swear to God it's like you know the i guess uh it earlier uh earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it's pretty self sufficient i just think
sw04141-B_014979-015846 y[ou]- they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that that's pretty much pretty much true
sw04141-B_016000-016249 yeah i it blew me away
sw04141-B_017025-017148 um-hum
sw04141-B_017726-017901 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04141-B_018602-018799 oh really
sw04141-B_018799-020250 uh we we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when you [laughter-know] you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your friends over play the Grateful Dead and clean your rifles and they pretty much get the idea
sw04141-B_020250-020582 uh [laughter-but] the dog i guess would work too
sw04141-B_020582-020782 [laughter]
sw04141-B_020782-020998 well it is a big dog
sw04141-B_021449-021772 oh okay
sw04141-B_022650-022825 oh
sw04141-B_022825-024045 wow well see they they say that the uh mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure blood line i guess makes them really weird

sw04141-B_028549-028689 [laughter]
sw04141-B_028689-029693 that's that's uh that's interesting i thought about for a while there uh there's a [vocalized-noise] a movement now to uh adopt ex-race dogs a[nd]-
sw04142-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04142-A_000027-000522 so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all
sw04142-A_001468-001589 um-hum
sw04142-A_002153-002328 oh that's nice
sw04142-A_003766-003890 right

sw04142-A_005197-006400 right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be
sw04142-A_006400-006563 less
sw04142-A_006563-006856 ability to get those all together
sw04142-A_007400-007531 um-hum
sw04142-A_007850-007960 um-hum
sw04142-A_008700-008848 really

sw04142-A_011909-012038 right
sw04142-A_012939-013287 really they didn't raise the they c[anceled]- your neighbors' taxes
sw04142-A_014023-014163 that's really great
sw04142-A_014847-015030 that's wonderful

sw04142-A_018241-018366 [laughter]
sw04142-A_019461-019799 right and you just bought yours that's the best argument i think
sw04142-A_020365-020541 that's wonderful
sw04142-A_020541-020678 i bet
sw04142-A_020792-020912 um-hum
sw04142-A_021399-021598 oh it was a it was a
sw04142-A_021785-022177 really wow it wasn't it wasn't the county council
sw04142-A_023279-023402 um-hum
sw04142-A_023757-023886 um-hum
sw04142-A_024227-024624 right well he di[d]- he probably knows it really well the real estate market
sw04142-A_024624-024816 so that was probably help
sw04142-A_025863-025993 uh-huh
sw04142-A_026423-026564 right
sw04142-A_026849-027033 right now it is
sw04142-A_027161-027294 right
sw04142-A_028183-028393 oh you got audited wow
sw04142-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04142-B_000264-000359 [noise]
sw04142-B_000359-001514 yeah actu[ally]- actually uh mine's real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on
sw04142-B_001514-002228 and uh that's usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because_1 i get a couple thousand dollars back usually
sw04142-B_002228-002944 but uh actually i uh i don't really begrudge uh the uh the government their due
sw04142-B_002944-003790 i d[o]- i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know there's a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes
sw04142-B_003790-004581 and i don't think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them_1 to the people [laughter-who] really need them [laughter] but uh
sw04142-B_004581-005198 generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation [laughter-so]
sw04142-B_006771-007463 yeah we actu[ally]- we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county
sw04142-B_007463-007887 and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was
sw04142-B_007887-008794 and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for [laughter]
sw04142-B_008794-009784 and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization
sw04142-B_009784-010365 uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadn't been made and all that kind of stuff
sw04142-B_010365-011310 and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of
sw04142-B_011310-012566 square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and ju[st]- just showed that you know our obvi[ous]- for some reason our property had been valued much higher
sw04142-B_012566-013118 and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the a[ppraisal]-
sw04142-B_013240-014063 uh they didn't raise my neighbors' [laughter-yeah] they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal
sw04142-B_014063-014928 so i y[ou]- you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh
sw04142-B_014928-015985 yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of
sw04142-B_015985-016800 mad at the world and [laughter-uh] [laughter-he] he had sort of tha[t]- that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away
sw04142-B_016800-018000 and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadn't been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff
sw04142-B_018000-018472 that just didn't impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time
sw04142-B_018472-019525 but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean
sw04142-B_019691-020519 yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty sa[tisfying]- satisfying [laughter] experience [laughter]
sw04142-B_020519-021443 but it wa[s]- it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like
sw04142-B_021594-021988 it was like a judge's chambers that that y[ou]-
sw04142-B_022127-023339 it was the it was the county but it wasn't the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i don't know i don't even know how they get on it you know i i'm just guessing they're appointed
sw04142-B_023339-024281 uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here [laughter-so] you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him [laughter-you]
sw04142-B_024281-024434 [noise]
sw04142-B_024555-024676 yeah
sw04142-B_024822-026075 but other than that uh i haven't had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh
sw04142-B_026075-026450 uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships
sw04142-B_026450-026913 and fortunately it was not taxable at that time
sw04142-B_026913-027220 bu[t]- they actua[lly]- they actually hassled me over it though
sw04142-B_027220-028303 and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain
sw04142-B_028303-028683 yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and
sw04142-B_028683-029726 you know [laughter] i just i said hey i mean it's tax free i mean that's my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually w[ork]- i work with a guy now who's
sw04142-B_029726-029885 i I i guess he was righ[t]-
sw04143-A_000000-000065 [noise] okay
sw04143-A_000065-000869 well um i know so[me]- in some of the one of the smaller towns around Dallas they started curbside recycling
sw04143-A_000869-001690 and that's going really well uh because they i think what ha[ppened]- what what goes on is they get like dis[counts]-
sw04143-A_001690-002814 they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables
sw04143-A_002814-003483 so it's so you get p[ay]- you pay less to have your trash picked up becau[se]- if you presort all out all your tra[sh]- all your recyclables
sw04143-A_003626-003793 what are they doing out there
sw04143-A_006627-006774 wow
sw04143-A_007307-007432 um-hum
sw04143-A_011654-011793 right
sw04143-A_012593-012709 um-hum
sw04143-A_012902-014024 and it's hard to find i know at least here it's hard to find places that w[ill]- that recycle and so many things are recyclable like shampoo bottles and water bottles
sw04143-A_014024-014224 but no place will take them_1
sw04143-A_014224-014897 and you know i mean they're real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out
sw04143-A_014897-015260 you know and well what do you do with the slick stuff
sw04143-A_015260-016038 i mean they're so specific i mean in i know in Dallas they're having a real hard time right now because the drop off sites
sw04143-A_016038-016624 people aren't there's a you know what they say that a couple people can mess it up for everybody
sw04143-A_016624-017644 and there's some people that are not sorting out uh like their slick stuff out of their newspapers and uh all their plastic bottles or their brown glass out of their clear glass
sw04143-A_017644-018187 and the companies that recycle the stuff won't recycle it then
sw04143-A_018187-018689 and they'll just trash it so tha[t]- all the effort goes downhill
sw04143-A_020794-020946 really
sw04143-A_020946-021101 that is great
sw04143-A_021101-021847 gee i- i didn't i- i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that that made it so they couldn't recycle it well that's great
sw04143-A_024043-024179 oh okay
sw04143-A_024179-024292 um-hum
sw04143-A_024710-024883 [laughter]
sw04143-A_025295-025399 yeah
sw04143-A_025500-025620 um
sw04143-A_027501-028404 right right i know well i know here at uh i i'm in i'm in college and um
sw04143-A_028404-028924 we have more than one campus and i'm on the kind of like an off branch campus
sw04143-A_028924-029994 and on the main campus they've got a company that comes in and takes out all the recyclables all the copy paper and all the cardboard box[es]- i mean everything that's recyclable
sw04143-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04143-B_000796-000918 um-hum
sw04143-B_002747-002866 oh
sw04143-B_003443-003632 oh that sounds great
sw04143-B_003769-004160 well [noise] it's sort of a mixed bag up here uh
sw04143-B_004160-005302 some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling uh one of the towns near here Cambridge uh had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but
sw04143-B_005302-006616 i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things
sw04143-B_006616-007355 and when the volume reached a certain level the city's Department of Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program
sw04143-B_007355-007628 uh my town Arlington
sw04143-B_007628-008658 has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh
sw04143-B_008658-009263 a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and
sw04143-B_009263-010584 and uh paper and and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border Arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and
sw04143-B_010584-011721 i really wish we'd do it here it's just so much easier for people and i think it's it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week
sw04143-B_011721-012956 as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the DPW yard and drop it off you know it's not a huge inconvenience but it's just one more thing to do
sw04143-B_013995-014094 um-hum
sw04143-B_015191-015307 yeah
sw04143-B_015976-016083 uh-huh
sw04143-B_016555-016673 right
sw04143-B_018128-018278 oh boy
sw04143-B_018780-019117 [laughter] boy that's [laughter-a] [laughter-real] problem tha[t]-
sw04143-B_019117-019969 really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers
sw04143-B_019969-020871 which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great
sw04143-B_020871-020995 yeah
sw04143-B_021709-022518 yeah i- i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and
sw04143-B_022518-023548 in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which
sw04143-B_023548-024208 i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically
sw04143-B_024208-025539 and uh you know i don't know about Dallas but [laughter-i] [laughter-think] people around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so there's just a lot of lot of containers that uh that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled
sw04143-B_025539-026351 and i don't know what's going on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that
sw04143-B_026351-027057 so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there
sw04143-B_027057-027526 that are willing to take the uh or you know that'll pay decent money to take the materials
sw04143-B_028195-028301 uh-huh
sw04143-B_028889-028996 um-hum
sw04143-B_029893-029994 oh that's great
sw04144-A_000000-000417 [noise] to uh [noise] trial by jury and whether it works or not is
sw04144-A_000532-001103 yeah i expect it's um [noise] about as good as one can expect um
sw04144-A_001103-001495 i suppose you get an illogical verdict now and then but uh
sw04144-A_001495-001620 the
sw04144-A_002069-002277 the jurors you mean the people
sw04144-A_002277-002614 yeah i just got called to my first jury duty uh-huh
sw04144-A_002614-002831 i never been on a jury how about you
sw04144-A_003187-003547 and were you did you did you show up and do it or whatever it was
sw04144-A_004607-005109 [noise] my brother was on some real complex business case where they were um
sw04144-A_005109-005809 dec[ide]- to asked to decide the exact amount to the penny of fraud in some credit card case you know [vocalized-noise]
sw04144-A_005809-005920 [vocalized-noise]
sw04144-A_006438-007071 well they went over it in the trial but they didn't give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh
sw04144-A_007554-008946 yeah but they have to ask for it and then the the bailiff brings it and they can look at it then the bailiff takes it away again it's not like they can just spread it out in their jury room and then you know get out a bunch of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up it was
sw04144-A_009396-010131 yeah right would you give me an I[DMS]- IDMS system or something like that [laughter] dear [laughter-judge]
sw04144-A_010131-010866 you know it was it was a very peculiar case i guess that one was didn't work very well um uh but
sw04144-A_011045-011357 no no i don't think so either um
sw04144-A_011591-012013 yeah yeah um i guess i guess nothing else but uh [noise]
sw04144-A_012302-012462 well
sw04144-A_012462-012835 for sentencing i don't know does that make any sense i mean
sw04144-A_012835-013587 it depends on wh[at]- i- i don't know what the offense is i guess that's why we have juries is to take each case on a case by case basis and that's fine
sw04144-A_013587-013822 anyway um
sw04144-A_016573-017032 yeah or if it's an organizational problem you know where where you know the
sw04144-A_017032-017663 you know it's possible to imagine a corrupt judicial system where you know all the judges are are
sw04144-A_017663-018026 part of the system i guess that happened in Chicago once huh
sw04144-A_018026-018221 [laughter]
sw04144-A_019016-019346 yeah yeah i guess they do anyway i guess
sw04144-A_019346-019990 the only trouble with the jury system i see is it's really da[rned]- darned expensive and and you know time consuming and
sw04144-A_019990-020358 you know and and all these systems of where you can like
sw04144-A_020358-020829 ask a jury ask each juror what they think about something then kick them_1 out and
sw04144-A_020829-021086 you know i guess they can manipulate it a little
sw04144-A_021714-021838 yeah
sw04144-A_022057-022279 yeah it's true no lie
sw04144-A_022989-023169 [laughter]
sw04144-A_023503-023722 beats me um
sw04144-A_023722-024203 yeah in in Massachusetts it's the judicial system their buildings are all falling [laughter-down]
sw04144-A_024203-024445 [noise] well i guess that gets them_1 the sample
sw04144-A_024445-024559 good night sir
sw04144-A_024559-024678 take it eas[y]- [noise]
sw04144-A_024779-024925 [noise]
sw04144-B_000000-000325 [noise]
sw04144-B_000325-000596 hey i like the current system
sw04144-B_001480-002164 y[eah]- yeah i figure the answer to that is to educate the consumers or the uh
sw04144-B_002164-002397 right [noise] just
sw04144-B_002778-002894 hey
sw04144-B_002894-003043 two weeks ago
sw04144-B_003043-003232 first time i was ever called
sw04144-B_003481-003985 oh yeah i showed up but uh the case settled before they could uh
sw04144-B_003985-004655 make us uh actually listen to anything so i have no idea what the case was about or uh you know i didn't get to do anything
sw04144-B_005749-006150 wait so the jury had to like go over
sw04144-B_006150-006555 [noise] ledgers and financial records and
sw04144-B_006975-007150 wait a second don't
sw04144-B_007150-007624 don't they have to enter that in as evidence and can't the jury request any piece of it
sw04144-B_008842-009501 right the the jurors request an IBM three seventy [laughter]
sw04144-B_009501-010380 [laughter]
sw04144-B_010732-011073 whoa that i'm not sure that's the jury's fault
sw04144-B_011303-011551 but i don't know what else they could've done
sw04144-B_011966-012407 TI suggests just giving it to the judge but uh
sw04144-B_013668-013892 no i mean the jury
sw04144-B_013892-014524 there's problems with it as far as finding jurors as far as weird verdicts
sw04144-B_014524-015076 as far as just the ti[ming]- the timing you know it takes a lot of time
sw04144-B_015076-015322 but uh
sw04144-B_015322-015640 you know i like it because_1 i think
sw04144-B_015640-015961 you don't have the abuse or it's a sort of a check
sw04144-B_015961-016263 if you have one guy doing something he can sort of
sw04144-B_016263-016620 go out of control and it's a long time before he gets reigned in
sw04144-B_016620-016819 and he can do a lot of damage
sw04144-B_017747-017897 [laughter-yeah]
sw04144-B_017999-018107 [noise] yeah
sw04144-B_018107-018587 or just even one guy just before you get a chance to uh
sw04144-B_018587-018879 you know to uh purge him
sw04144-B_018879-019089 he could do a lot of damage
sw04144-B_020970-021292 you know maybe some of the uh
sw04144-B_021292-021463 like the hype
sw04144-B_021463-021679 needs to be cut out
sw04144-B_021679-021894 but you mention expense
sw04144-B_021894-022127 i think you get what you pay for
sw04144-B_022127-022573 you know if you want a cheap legal system you're you're gonna get that kind of
sw04144-B_022573-022833 Kmart service or uh
sw04144-B_022833-023048 well Kmart's not all that bad
sw04144-B_023048-023262 there's got to be some sort of cheap
sw04144-B_023262-023507 what's the epitome of cheap these days
sw04144-B_024003-024350 [laughter]
sw04144-B_024507-024718 all right good luck
sw04144-B_024857-024925 [noise]
sw04145-A_000000-000117 [noise]
sw04145-A_000117-000268 so
sw04145-A_000268-000492 do you live in a high crime area
sw04145-A_001048-001178 uh-huh
sw04145-A_002096-002266 [noise] oh
sw04145-A_003114-003389 do you think that that will do it
sw04145-A_004075-004351 they'll go to the yeah
sw04145-A_004351-004501 huh
sw04145-A_004863-005048 okay
sw04145-A_005048-005250 yeah Arlington Texas
sw04145-A_005642-005740 uh-huh
sw04145-A_005944-006164 you don't have much street crime
sw04145-A_006562-006672 right
sw04145-A_006910-007049 um
sw04145-A_007049-007649 that's what i would think in that area yeah so what do you think you can do to uh
sw04145-A_008559-008711 uh-huh
sw04145-A_008962-009104 [noise] right
sw04145-A_009721-009874 right
sw04145-A_009874-010104 family unit you mean
sw04145-A_010574-010681 uh-huh
sw04145-A_011107-011247 uh-huh
sw04145-A_012149-012302 fix
sw04145-A_012302-012433 yeah
sw04145-A_012569-012759 yeah and that's what
sw04145-A_012759-013205 the uh seems like the uh genre of the crime these days is
sw04145-A_013205-014087 a lot of desperate people whereas i think probably fifty years ago the crime wasn't quite so intense that way [vocalized-noise]
sw04145-A_014087-014249 yeah
sw04145-A_014351-014479 [noise] with the
sw04145-A_014479-014640 uh-huh
sw04145-A_015096-016220 well i mean i think the reasons were different back then more than they are now like you're saying the drugs can make people really desperate so that makes them also very dangerous
sw04145-A_016220-016360 uh
sw04145-A_016780-016934 uh-huh
sw04145-A_017452-017575 uh-huh
sw04145-A_017864-018018 [noise] yeah
sw04145-A_018125-018345 yeah that's really disgusting
sw04145-A_018345-018535 yeah
sw04145-A_018849-018980 uh-huh
sw04145-A_018980-019100 right
sw04145-A_019302-019430 uh-huh
sw04145-A_019584-019843 oh yeah because they have no idea what it's like
sw04145-A_019843-019977 yeah
sw04145-A_019977-020148 um-hum
sw04145-A_020650-020824 uh-huh
sw04145-A_021433-021577 right
sw04145-A_021804-022698 well i think [noise] for the US i think bas[ically]- from what i've read that the US has one of the highest crime rates in the world so i think that's a priority
sw04145-A_022872-023065 [noise] we're not
sw04145-A_023065-023197 [vocalized-noise]
sw04145-A_023306-023451 huh
sw04145-A_023761-023908 [laughter-right]
sw04145-A_024201-024336 yeah
sw04145-A_024751-025256 no if you come down to it if you look at uh the statistics on child abuse
sw04145-A_025256-026336 and uh violence against women and uh the drug wars and uh also um
sw04145-A_026336-027425 let's see i think with like with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh
sw04145-A_027425-028321 uh like with the drugs i think that one solution that i kn[ow]- i hate to say it [noise] but is legalization
sw04145-A_028321-029036 [noise] because that's where all the d[rug]- the gangs get their power over the drugs because it's illegal
sw04145-A_029036-029955 and uh i there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that but i- just nothing else seems to be working
sw04145-B_000000-000143 [noise] okay
sw04145-B_000143-000263 well
sw04145-B_000416-001647 oh it's uh yes and it's the crime mostly in this area is uh burglary house break-ins in fact our car our son's uh car was broken into about
sw04145-B_001647-002432 two weekends ago three weekends ago they stole a stereo i mean it was parked out in front of our house it happened overnight but there's a uh
sw04145-B_002432-003280 we we had a break at our place our house about three years ago bought an alarm system about within five days after that uh
sw04145-B_003280-004268 oh i don't think anything is going to be uh is foolproof i think it's it's a deterrent i think if they have a choice between our place and one house that's not protected they'll go to the other place
sw04145-B_004268-005119 but uh it's uh [vocalized-noise] we live in uh well i live in Richardson actually you say Arlington do you mean Arlington Texas
sw04145-B_005119-006046 yeah yeah and uh the crime out here is mostly of the break in type and vandalism and sort of stuff like that i don't think there
sw04145-B_006046-007153 n[o]- no as far as uh muggings and murders and stuff like that no that's pretty isolated pretty rare i think w[ould]- knock on wood
sw04145-B_007153-007469 [noise] yeah but
sw04145-B_007682-008700 oh [noise] you know i i think a lot of the crime is c[ommitted]- committed by people that are trying to uh finance their next fix and uh
sw04145-B_008700-009409 it's you know that goes back to a drug problem and uh nobody's been able to solve that yet i think it's uh
sw04145-B_009409-010869 drug related and then uh a lot of it starts in the homes and uh the the uh breakup of breakup of the family unit's caused a lot of the problems i mean the dad is gone for one reason or another the mother's raising the kids and uh
sw04145-B_010869-012230 they just get there's no discipline at the at the home so it just goes from bad to worse it just starts there and leads leads from that into the drug situation and then as i said they're trying to finance their next uh
sw04145-B_012230-012597 next fix so they're desperate uh
sw04145-B_013310-013453 um-hum
sw04145-B_013554-013731 right yeah
sw04145-B_013910-015181 probably wasn't as personal as it is today i mean b[reak]- with the uh muggings and the break-ins of the houses and so forth then th[ere]- there just wasn't as much of it i i imagine as as there is now
sw04145-B_015416-015588 yeah
sw04145-B_015704-015847 yeah
sw04145-B_016113-017504 [noise] yeah well i think the courts are to blame i- i- i just think they're they're overly lenient on these people and i was watching Larry King Live there and they were they were talking about rape and castration and so forth and
sw04145-B_017504-018259 there's always so much concern about the uh the rapist and the the burglar and so forth and no concern at all about the victim [vocalized-noise]
sw04145-B_018259-019644 yeah so uh it i think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul but it starts in the family but it's [laughter-everybody's] to blame i think at least a lot of probably a lot of apathy on the part of people that haven't been uh victimized
sw04145-B_019754-020247 right so uh it it it's just a big problem and uh
sw04145-B_020247-021525 there's so many other problems to go around and economy's a problem and i guess at one time Russia was a problem and uh every there there's always one problem or another seems to be uh ahead of the crime problem but uh
sw04145-B_021525-021888 that's probably that has to be one of the top two or three
sw04145-B_022362-022531 um-hum
sw04145-B_022635-023493 yeah you know i think we think we're real sophisticated we're really not when you come right down to it there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways and the roads when you're driving around dropped by people that are
sw04145-B_023493-024298 that you makes makes you wonder whether they're just not jerks or not i mean they just do crazy thing they they're not breaking the law but they just do some crazy things and
sw04145-B_024298-024853 oh i don't know it's it's kind of disgusting but they we're really not all that sophisticated over here
sw04145-B_025200-025345 um-hum
sw04145-B_025451-025591 um
sw04145-B_026810-027329 what's that yeah um-hum
sw04145-B_028266-028428 uh-huh
sw04145-B_028651-028786 uh-huh
sw04145-B_028948-029095 right
sw04145-B_029494-029649 yeah
sw04145-B_029800-029955 yeah i was going to say it's worth
sw04146-A_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04146-A_000150-000405 uh yeah you go ahead
sw04146-A_005247-005704 oh yeah it's it's just in[credibly]- incredibly complex uh
sw04146-A_005704-006800 uh i- i don't have any problem with the idea of having the jurors although it is a bit disappointing to see the attorneys manipulate the process by
sw04146-A_006800-007600 uh raising so many objections to jurors so that they can try and get for their client um a jury slanted one way
sw04146-A_007600-008924 or the other i mean you can sit there and dismiss people for for trivial reasons and and that takes up a good deal of time too um the the thing i find sort of disappointing about uh a lot of this is that
sw04146-A_008924-010359 often a judge uh and and you hope you get one that's that's really rational and and looks at uh each case separately you'd like to be able to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence
sw04146-A_010359-011499 uh if it's a really awful crime to really put the person away for a long time uh or if there's a lot of intent there and it's obvious put them away on the other hand
sw04146-A_011499-011900 you know maybe to to change the sentencing slightly uh
sw04146-A_011900-013304 that you'd like be able to see them give a different kind of punishment uh not necessary community service that's getting a little bit overworked but but but rather some of other sort of of restitution rather than simply putting them_1 away behind bars
sw04146-A_015545-015700 oh yeah
sw04146-A_016350-016479 [laughter]
sw04146-A_016479-016849 people that have been on the moon [laughter]
sw04146-A_020800-021075 oh yes my my
sw04146-A_021075-022146 oh that's that and and that's actually pretty good my my mother recently uh uh had jury duty uh down in in Texas and uh
sw04146-A_022146-022560 the the judge would not hear any excuses i mean from anybody
sw04146-A_022560-023683 uh he didn't care if they had doctor's appointments or anything he said you're you're here in the pool and you're going to serve but when it came time for and and it turned out it was a rape trial
sw04146-A_023683-024858 uh and the uh uh the attorney asked my mother well uh how do you feel about this and she told him quite frankly that she thought that the punishment should be extremely severe for rapist and then
sw04146-A_024858-025781 the guy began to ask um what does your husband do for a living well he's retired Air Force ah was he retired law enforcement Air Force
sw04146-A_025781-026805 they they dismissed her on the grounds that they didn't want her that her husband could have been seen as being in law enforcement even though he was a programmer [laughter] in the Air Force
sw04146-A_026805-027750 they wanted to stay away from anybody that might even have a smidgen of law enforcement so even though she was there to do her duty to serve
sw04146-A_027750-028449 she was dismissed on the grounds that she might possibly remotely have some prejudice and that's
sw04146-A_028449-029885 my mother's fairly well read she didn't actually know about this local case it was of rather small import uh but i would agree with you that that not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant not to know but they'd have to have met
sw04146-B_000000-000298 [noise] you want to start or should i start
sw04146-B_000298-001550 okay let's see uh i think that uh i- i think that trials by jury are a good idea i just think the concept of multiple attempts
sw04146-B_001550-002533 uh [laughter-at] trial is wh[en]- uh with when they're always saying oh well uh uh i want to appeal i want to appeal i want to appeal i
sw04146-B_002533-003428 i think multiple appeal is what our real problem is it's not the not the the twelve man jury trials uh
sw04146-B_003428-004035 think that that i- i would not be totally adverse to the concept of of uh
sw04146-B_004035-005385 of uh i guess uh uh judge trials either uh i think our our we have a real big problem with litigation we we spend too much of our time litigation in our legal system and
sw04146-B_005385-005478 [laughter]
sw04146-B_007877-007999 um-hum
sw04146-B_013229-014540 um-hum uh trial well one thing is we do not have a trial by peers anymore uh that's that that is g[one]- go[ne]- gone out gone out the door for one thing
sw04146-B_014540-014946 the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury
sw04146-B_014946-015600 [laughter] as part of in fact as part of the process they're not supposed to know anything whatsoever about the trial
sw04146-B_015600-016478 so particular so particularly for famous trials what that indicates is that the only people who are really at that jury are idiots [laughter]
sw04146-B_016599-017450 right only ignorant people and that means low IQ generally [laughter] wherein that's not that's not trial by jury
sw04146-B_017450-018472 now i guess that's that that's become less so i've noted that um uh the last couple times that i've had to go by jury they've actually selected intelligent jurors
sw04146-B_018472-019551 now i- i i'm not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of uh of uh some notor[ious]- no[toriety]- no[toriety]- notoriety
sw04146-B_019551-020900 uh but in the case of the normal trials it's much much harder than it used to be t[o]- than to get out of it so they do try not to let uh excuses get you out of uh trials now
sw04146-B_020900-021250 you can delay it but you can't get out [laughter]

sw04147-A_001069-001206 uh-huh
sw04147-A_001348-001475 all right
sw04147-A_001682-001801 yeah
sw04147-A_002168-002520 oh that's good you don't often find that i don't think
sw04147-A_003173-003293 right
sw04147-A_003925-004049 uh-huh
sw04147-A_004356-005287 sure there's a okay uh that's interesting yeah the only pet that i've had uh i'm a i'm a doctoral student right now
sw04147-A_005287-006095 and in my in my earlier days as a student [noise] i kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine
sw04147-A_006095-007078 and uh it was an amazing dog it really was they had he had gotten it from the pound and uh it it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino
sw04147-A_007078-007986 kind of looks like a Dal[matian]- a Dalmatian and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it it's fully trained and it can do
sw04147-A_007986-008571 a lot of things it will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff
sw04147-A_008571-009330 so it's really [noise] it's it's kind of a show piece [laughter-anymore] and whenever anybody comes over we always have to show him Domino [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04147-A_009438-010496 yeah it's uh she's been a real good a real good dog and uh just it's kind of a shame that i'm i'm go[ne]- i'm away from it now i- i j[ust]- i actually live in Florida
sw04147-A_010496-011446 but i'm on an internship up here for a year and then i go back down but uh yeah Domino's a real good dog uh
sw04147-A_011446-011741 what uh possessed you to get the dog
sw04147-A_012695-012828 yeah
sw04147-A_013373-013475 uh-huh
sw04147-A_014199-014990 sure sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that that's good that kind of builds some character a little bit
sw04147-A_015866-016003 um-hum
sw04147-A_016887-017016 uh-huh
sw04147-A_017891-018164 yeah that's something that's important for sure
sw04147-A_018164-018813 i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh [vocalized-noise] or
sw04147-A_019393-019547 oh i see
sw04147-A_020000-020112 um
sw04147-A_020714-020844 yeah
sw04147-A_021123-021727 yeah it's not that big of a problem With Domino she was full grown i would estimate seventy pounds
sw04147-A_021727-022381 and you know w[e]- we lived in Oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of Orlando
sw04147-A_022381-022974 but [noise] there's not there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run
sw04147-A_022974-024270 so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or c[an]- you know i guess you can't really say for cats
sw04147-A_024270-025138 me and cats don't get along too well uh [laughter] but you know that whole space issue i think is real important
sw04147-A_026594-026871 right yeah that that
sw04147-A_026972-027862 sure and that's all part of y[our]- of keeping your part of the relationship you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues
sw04147-A_027862-028791 you know and also the whole the whole thing with noise my mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them
sw04147-A_028791-029917 and you know we h[ad]- we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had uh Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with but uh
sw04147-B_000000-000021 [noise]
sw04147-B_000021-000675 yes we do have a pet we have a [noise] a dog that we got from the uh
sw04147-B_000675-001812 well we call it the S P C A it's the uh an[imal]- from an animal shelter uh he'd come in there as a stray uh he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross uh
sw04147-B_001812-002402 well he was very well trained when we got him uh he's
sw04147-B_002402-003273 no uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because [noise]
sw04147-B_003273-004004 a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
sw04147-B_004004-004448 and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him
sw04147-B_005215-005344 uh-huh
sw04147-B_006013-006122 [noise]
sw04147-B_007016-007165 oh yeah
sw04147-B_007275-007399 uh-huh
sw04147-B_009272-009477 [noise] oh i think so
sw04147-B_010414-010558 uh-huh
sw04147-B_011251-011382 yeah
sw04147-B_011712-012391 well i- i guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog
sw04147-B_012391-013438 even though there are you know complications come with it and then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so
sw04147-B_013438-014375 it was an age where it was uh we thought it would be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet uh
sw04147-B_014573-014687 yeah
sw04147-B_014687-014789 right
sw04147-B_014789-014843 [noise]
sw04147-B_014843-015493 uh well that's the idea i think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh
sw04147-B_015493-015891 it depends on the on everyone's discipline
sw04147-B_015891-016970 and uh from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog and uh we've had him about four years now
sw04147-B_016970-017097 [noise] uh
sw04147-B_017097-018074 [noise] but i think it does it it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh
sw04147-B_018074-018195 yeah
sw04147-B_018613-019447 uh actually no we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university
sw04147-B_019447-020046 uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
sw04147-B_020046-020251 and uh
sw04147-B_020251-021270 [noise] so that is not as good uh [noise] you know this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable but again
sw04147-B_021661-021782 yeah
sw04147-B_022332-022449 uh-huh
sw04147-B_025053-025555 [noise] yeah it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns it's like
sw04147-B_025555-026082 uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time
sw04147-B_026082-026725 one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal
sw04147-B_026725-027061 and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
sw04147-B_027249-027373 right
sw04147-B_027809-027924 well
sw04147-B_028748-028863 uh-huh
sw04148-A_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04148-A_000137-000472 okay so um
sw04148-A_000472-001660 with the issue of trial by jury um i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan[imous]- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
sw04148-A_003041-004384 i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because_1 i thought there were cases where uh i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve
sw04148-A_004739-004833 yeah
sw04148-A_007042-007730 well i'd be curious as to what the um requirement for a an acquittal is
sw04148-A_007730-009186 i mean i- i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
sw04148-A_009186-009751 but i don't know whether you need an [anani[mous]-/unanimous] a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit
sw04148-A_013360-013661 [noise]
sw04148-A_013661-014461 yeah i'd agree with that but i've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years
sw04148-A_014461-014568 but
sw04148-A_015759-015874 oh
sw04148-A_016773-017226 well the people i know who've served have said that usually what ends up happening
sw04148-A_017226-017683 is that you know after initially finding out where people stand
sw04148-A_017683-019068 that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
sw04148-A_019068-019475 and in fact i'm not sure that that's anymore
sw04148-A_019475-019927 uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt
sw04148-A_019927-020158 than than anything else
sw04148-A_021488-021599 um-hum
sw04148-A_022986-023815 yeah i'd read one book i think it was called Trial by Jury of [laughter-all] [laughter-things] that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases
sw04148-A_023815-025101 and in many cases looking at what had ha[ppened]- at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing
sw04148-A_025101-025315 the verdict uh
sw04148-A_025315-025789 you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in
sw04148-A_025789-026511 knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury
sw04148-A_026511-027015 because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
sw04148-A_028462-028592 um-hum
sw04148-A_028592-028749 yeah once
sw04148-B_000000-000107 [noise] hi
sw04148-B_001650-003088 yeah actually i a[gree]- i agree that [noise] that's an interesting thing i i believe that's a for for civil suits it's not unanimous right but for for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
sw04148-B_004376-005318 yeah i actually thought i'd read that too and that's why i phrased it that way i wonder the difference yeah the difference could be that for um state
sw04148-B_005318-006402 if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require
sw04148-B_006402-007104 but i don't know what the the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable um requirement that they be unanimous
sw04148-B_009778-010954 yeah that that would be an interesting change it would also allow i[dea]- the um idea that if you had one person who was um very disagreeable
sw04148-B_010954-011627 that i mean i[t]- it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because um
sw04148-B_011627-012741 the fact that it's [noise] well the the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt um criterion that it um
sw04148-B_012741-013659 increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
sw04148-B_014415-015809 yeah actually i- i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do i would like to do that i've been out here twenty some years and i've been called um three different times but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box
sw04148-B_015809-016438 and because_1 there have always been a number of people and and i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions
sw04148-B_016438-016850 um i yeah i also think that would be really good uh
sw04148-B_019045-019167 um-hum
sw04148-B_020168-020584 well the o[ne]- the one thing that i know does seem to happen i[s]-
sw04148-B_020584-021522 from people i've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's an effect starts being that there's a lot of peer pressure
sw04148-B_021522-022983 going on and that that um peer pressure and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
sw04148-B_022983-023116 um
sw04148-B_023319-023426 um-hum
sw04148-B_026973-027735 yeah i i understand you you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude um
sw04148-B_027735-028641 to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response i think of the movie um Twelve Angry Men you ever seen that movie
sw04148-B_028641-029971 uh yeah it's it's it's exactly that situation where uh it's Henry Fonda and it's eleven to one and he's the one i- i believe he was opposed to the conviction and uh and he held on and
sw04149-A_000000-001086 [noise] Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh
sw04149-A_001086-001782 let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
sw04149-A_002091-002226 um-hum
sw04149-A_002390-002551 uh-huh
sw04149-A_003678-004534 i see i see well good i'm i'm kind of in a different situation but i- i- i went through that too when i was in school
sw04149-A_004534-005241 but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh
sw04149-A_005241-006341 i'm married and have uh a couple of children and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget i'm on a salary so i don't get any overtime or anything like that so
sw04149-A_006341-007175 but we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is is spent accordingly
sw04149-A_007175-007347 and um
sw04149-A_007347-008359 what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums
sw04149-A_008359-009408 um utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend
sw04149-A_009408-010786 and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll[ege]- the kids' education college education the future and uh
sw04149-A_010786-011377 set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because_1
sw04149-A_011377-012704 we've uh [laughter] we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh
sw04149-A_012704-013139 it's not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
sw04149-A_013139-014017 and uh then we have you know whatever's left over is disposable in[come]- disposable dis[posable]- yeah discretionary income
sw04149-A_014017-014888 [laughter] that we use for the rest of the month so and it's worked out very well it's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been
sw04149-A_014888-015818 you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i uh my wife is
sw04149-A_015818-016670 is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it and there's no surprises in that [laughter]

sw04150-B_000990-002355 so this is a big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but [laughter] perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and

sw04150-B_006678-006837 [laughter]
sw04150-B_006949-007841 well i don't wanna i don't want this to be a [laughter-unilateral] [laughter-conversation] but [noise] yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade
sw04150-B_007841-008892 and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful the kids they're real people and they're interesting and [noise] they they have all their own activities and um
sw04150-B_008892-010053 i think as parents we really enjoy them_1 and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel [laughter] i'm su[re]- i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids
sw04150-B_010778-011015 you had eight boys and one girl
sw04150-B_011850-012036 [noise] are you Mormons
sw04150-B_012036-012288 because_1 with Utah and the large family
sw04150-B_012530-013001 [noise] well we're Catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers the only girl
sw04150-B_013001-013377 and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
sw04150-B_013377-013793 i never felt spoiled in fact i always felt my toys were destroyed [laughter]
sw04150-B_013963-014286 no usually busy fighting for survival
sw04150-B_014518-015215 well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um
sw04150-B_015215-015467 that i think um
sw04150-B_015467-016198 i don't know it's an interesting phenomena i happen to um [noise] i'm a pediatrician my husband is a physician so um
sw04150-B_016198-016947 i- i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot uh children i- i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home
sw04150-B_016947-017613 um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
sw04150-B_017613-018846 and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that
sw04150-B_018846-019055 and it has um
sw04150-B_019055-019767 helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure
sw04150-B_019767-020733 and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's
sw04150-B_020733-021086 i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well
sw04150-B_021692-022339 there's no question i think that's really the best if if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way
sw04150-B_022339-022812 i was twenty nine when i had my first child and um i would not have
sw04150-B_022812-023556 been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but
sw04150-B_023556-024123 um i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours
sw04150-B_024123-024972 [noise] i nursed all three of our children till they were at least a year and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers
sw04150-B_024972-025130 um
sw04150-B_025130-025971 and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in
sw04150-B_025971-027023 some babysitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they [noise] they learn to share
sw04150-B_027023-027706 and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they're secure [noise] i think that helps
sw04150-B_027937-028336 oh yeah hope so so your wife does she work right now
sw04150-B_028472-028616 she's out
sw04150-B_028994-029194 so you're still trying to dry out
sw04151-A_000000-000503 [noise] do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person
sw04151-A_000503-000855 who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore
sw04151-A_004208-004351 um-hum
sw04151-A_005256-006420 of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i I like the statement made by uh Cuomo Cuomo i I believe is um he's he's governor of New York but uh he's
sw04151-A_006420-006634 against the death penalty
sw04151-A_006634-007849 but um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife and that's but but even even in that circum[stance]- in that uh
sw04151-A_007849-008465 uh situation he would be he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh
sw04151-A_008465-008766 keep him from [laughter] doing the doing tho[se]- things
sw04151-A_009801-009980 right exactly
sw04151-A_011849-011988 um-hum
sw04151-A_015567-015700 yeah
sw04151-A_016444-017515 see i don't think a decision's ever gonna be made on dea[th]- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who
sw04151-A_017515-018367 can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal
sw04151-A_018367-019208 institution is it de[signed]- is it designed for punishment um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punish
sw04151-A_019208-020196 um perhaps not in the manner that we do it but but it it in in theory it fits in in reform[atory]- system in a reformatory
sw04151-A_020196-020751 i mean [laughter] if you if you put someone to death y[ou]- you obviously can't reform [laughter-them]
sw04151-A_020751-020896 yeah
sw04151-A_024073-024214 yeah
sw04151-A_024419-025615 i don't think it's done i don't think we run it as a deterrent i mean people say that but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves
sw04151-A_025615-026098 hanging by their necks every once in a while and
sw04151-A_026098-026738 if we really wa[nt]- if it was really seriously gonna be a de[terrent]- deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be
sw04151-A_026738-027591 this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it if someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that that might be inclined more towards the life of crime
sw04151-A_027591-028625 had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by firing squad or something like that i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than
sw04151-A_028625-028958 you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here
sw04151-A_028958-029147 at the you know
sw04151-B_000000-000055 [noise]
sw04151-B_000903-001603 that's a good question uh [noise] there would be a point there was a point where i would have said
sw04151-B_001603-002668 know that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed but uh since i've become a parent and since i've
sw04151-B_002668-003167 seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer i really have to question that
sw04151-B_003167-003625 i really uh i i can't conceive of
sw04151-B_003625-003836 someone being that
sw04151-B_003836-004278 brutal to that many other people
sw04151-B_004278-004444 and uh
sw04151-B_004563-004993 try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
sw04151-B_004993-005163 uh
sw04151-B_008785-009857 oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
sw04151-B_009857-010852 uh a[nd]- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he
sw04151-B_010852-011876 he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion
sw04151-B_011876-012792 a a gut level reaction and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty
sw04151-B_012792-013191 are really working from that gut level
sw04151-B_013191-014209 uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic
sw04151-B_014209-014721 or just uh uh some sort of anger at
sw04151-B_014721-015611 putting peo[ple]- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
sw04151-B_015611-016462 i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reasoned humane one
sw04151-B_020491-020669 [laughter]
sw04151-B_020669-020875 that's true
sw04151-B_020875-021583 uh the the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
sw04151-B_021583-022856 and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty
sw04151-B_022856-023231 would stop at the moment and say
sw04151-B_023231-024456 well i was about to kill and dismember this person but ooh if they catch me they're going to kill me so i better not do it i i just don't think that uh that it works that way
sw04151-B_025701-025833 um-hum
sw04151-B_029052-029904 well i I don't know if that would really work that way or not uh there's a lot of violence
sw04152-A_000000-000075 [noise] oh well
sw04152-A_000075-000301 anyway i uh
sw04152-A_000301-000697 i uh oh i- i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way
sw04152-A_000697-000881 oh you're Ann hi
sw04152-A_000881-001080 but um
sw04152-A_001080-001922 anyway i uh lot of lot of s[tuff]- interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to
sw04152-A_001922-002487 talking about the subject to[night]- tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the
sw04152-A_002487-003200 yeah the [vocalized-noise] the one of which was uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04152-A_003200-004344 something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race
sw04152-A_004344-004853 uh ye[ah]- yeah well the the uh the the people that
sw04152-A_004853-005855 [vocalized-noise] the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact
sw04152-A_006208-006612 they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here
sw04152-A_006612-007803 um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that
sw04152-A_007954-008138 yeah it was everywhere
sw04152-A_008138-009009 so you know and i- i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
sw04152-A_010662-011050 exactly you know um the
sw04152-A_011050-012018 [noise] you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
sw04152-A_012018-012896 but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict
sw04152-A_012896-014227 uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough
sw04152-A_015208-015346 i um
sw04152-A_015669-017016 they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i- i rather imagine there's [noise] there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic
sw04152-A_017016-017300 oh here we go again folks kind of stuff
sw04152-A_017740-019113 no no i you know on on on one hand y[ou]- on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's th[ey]- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy [noise]
sw04152-A_019113-019331 um
sw04152-A_020252-020414 um-hum
sw04152-A_020414-020551 well
sw04152-A_020696-020817 yeah
sw04152-A_020817-020937 um
sw04152-A_021296-021459 [noise]
sw04152-A_021459-022002 i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at]- you know there was a
sw04152-A_022002-022331 [noise] uh i[t]- something else along those lines there was a girl
sw04152-A_022331-023591 out here named Latausha Harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem um
sw04152-A_023591-024331 girl walked into a Korean owned store [noise] and uh they she had a dispute black girl
sw04152-A_024331-025057 she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her
sw04152-A_025158-026298 yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and [noise] and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh
sw04152-A_026298-026645 uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was
sw04152-A_026645-027840 it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge
sw04152-A_027840-027949 [vocalized-noise]
sw04152-A_027949-028164 yeah yeah
sw04152-A_028899-029338 yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but
sw04152-A_029597-029723 um-hum
sw04152-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04152-B_000591-000746 um i'm Ann
sw04152-B_002360-002588 criminal courts yes
sw04152-B_004432-004700 oh really
sw04152-B_005266-005394 right
sw04152-B_005758-006308 how is it i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one
sw04152-B_006532-006665 oh
sw04152-B_007723-008076 well that videotape was just horrible
sw04152-B_008076-008208 yeah
sw04152-B_008944-009961 oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or
sw04152-B_009961-010745 you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
sw04152-B_012867-013000 right
sw04152-B_013813-013979 exactly
sw04152-B_014082-014354 based on fact right
sw04152-B_014354-014652 how interesting ooh
sw04152-B_014652-015235 so what's the prevailing thought within the community
sw04152-B_015235-015734 i mean you know what the news media's gonna make of it but what about the community
sw04152-B_017161-017317 uh-huh
sw04152-B_017317-017834 oh my goodness that can't be good for Los Angeles either
sw04152-B_018764-018949 oh exactly
sw04152-B_019250-019532 unfortunately that kind of thing is not
sw04152-B_019532-019769 limited to
sw04152-B_019769-020143 uh a big city like Los Angeles you're going to have it
sw04152-B_020143-020350 just about anywhere
sw04152-B_020350-020749 there but that's that's interesting
sw04152-B_020900-021564 what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a g[ood]- a good adjudicator
sw04152-B_024266-024402 uh-huh
sw04152-B_025070-025249 oh really
sw04152-B_026551-026716 oh my goodness
sw04152-B_027696-028035 to get that judge recalled i would think
sw04152-B_028035-028942 hm that's almost when you kind of wish that there where st[andardized]- standardized sentences
sw04152-B_029119-029651 it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing
sw04152-B_029651-029895 and then it's a matter of of deciding g[uilt]-
sw04153-A_000000-000965 [noise] okay well um i used to work in a day care center i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and [noise] it is
sw04153-A_000965-002268 they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers
sw04153-A_002268-003066 all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
sw04153-A_003066-003954 so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks
sw04153-A_003954-004710 and um to check in on them_1 when they're [laughter-not] [laughter-expecting] it because they do do things differently when you're not around
sw04153-A_004710-004842 so
sw04153-A_005433-005580 um-hum
sw04153-A_005809-005950 right
sw04153-A_006306-006439 um-hum
sw04153-A_007629-007758 um-hum
sw04153-A_007989-008498 well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room
sw04153-A_008498-009165 um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool
sw04153-A_009165-009491 the problem i had was that
sw04153-A_009491-010346 they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left
sw04153-A_010346-010548 um they
sw04153-A_010548-011476 one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them_1 up
sw04153-A_011476-012014 and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem
sw04153-A_012014-012148 so um
sw04153-A_012331-012455 yes
sw04153-A_012683-013882 right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds
sw04153-A_013882-014444 upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that
sw04153-A_014444-015001 you know they really did separate them_1 well it was just the teachers themselves
sw04153-A_015520-015833 right but yeah that they're not
sw04153-A_015936-016131 yeah their system
sw04153-A_016131-016786 right but their but their system was was great but um the
sw04153-A_016786-017500 you know the caring just wasn't there the one woman that taught that did the babies
sw04153-A_017500-018665 i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them_1 and cared for them_1 but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and
sw04153-A_018665-019213 um you know would make me a nervous wreck [laughter-so] you know
sw04153-A_020484-020816 yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day
sw04153-A_020816-021287 and uh with no any type of emotional
sw04153-A_021287-021701 you know getting love getting care they're just there
sw04153-A_021701-022123 you know going through this routine which is lousy
sw04153-A_022723-022859 um-hum
sw04153-A_024755-024895 um-hum
sw04153-A_025155-025295 uh-huh
sw04153-A_025947-026200 yeah you don't see that much
sw04153-A_026555-026724 that's cute
sw04153-A_027700-027999 yeah that has to be with a day care center
sw04153-A_028745-029095 i've never heard of that that's that's a new one on me
sw04153-A_029666-029847 uh-huh
sw04153-B_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04153-B_000371-000547 uh-huh
sw04153-B_001141-001242 hm
sw04153-B_002233-002358 um-hum
sw04153-B_003052-003184 yeah
sw04153-B_004333-004449 [vocalized-noise]
sw04153-B_004806-005488 well that i know wh[at]- the things that we kind of looked at is is you wanna see how many teachers you have
sw04153-B_005488-005856 and and how many kids they have and how they break it up
sw04153-B_005856-006345 because we had [noise] we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
sw04153-B_006345-007477 it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because_1 my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them_1 and then you know so we got our
sw04153-B_007477-007698 uh day care free
sw04153-B_007698-007998 but they didn't have enough teachers
sw04153-B_007998-008109 and
sw04153-B_008281-008414 uh-huh
sw04153-B_009096-009230 um-hum
sw04153-B_010287-010428 um-hum
sw04153-B_011129-011257 hm
sw04153-B_011426-011624 [laughter]
sw04153-B_011848-011986 yeah
sw04153-B_012144-012402 did did they separate them_1 by age group
sw04153-B_012402-012744 because_1 i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important
sw04153-B_012744-012856 [vocalized-noise]
sw04153-B_013197-013346 uh-huh
sw04153-B_014404-014546 yeah [noise]
sw04153-B_014687-014932 it it sound yeah
sw04153-B_014932-015581 it sounds like to me your [noise] your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
sw04153-B_015581-016234 [laughter] affectionate people that they're they're kind of par[ents]- [noise] maybe parents themselves or something
sw04153-B_016234-016397 uh
sw04153-B_017111-017250 um-hum
sw04153-B_017709-017839 um-hum
sw04153-B_019048-019580 yeah i- i- i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have
sw04153-B_019580-020141 doctorates and PhD's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff
sw04153-B_020141-020587 but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
sw04153-B_020749-020874 yeah
sw04153-B_021652-021766 yeah
sw04153-B_021951-022091 an[d]-
sw04153-B_022091-023124 the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but
sw04153-B_023124-024264 uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them_1 and stuff you know but he was actually the more
sw04153-B_024264-024431 um
sw04153-B_024431-025228 the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and
sw04153-B_025228-025750 and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that
sw04153-B_025750-026083 that did that side of it an[d]-
sw04153-B_026083-026739 yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did
sw04153-B_026739-027338 they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um
sw04153-B_027338-027719 you know obedience obedience was important
sw04153-B_027719-028116 and you know so they u[sed]- you know they used uh
sw04153-B_028116-028770 oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
sw04153-B_028770-029731 and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but y[ou]- you just stand them_1 in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around
sw04153-B_029731-029847 and they have to stand there
sw04154-A_000000-000175 [noise] what do you feel about the um
sw04154-A_000175-000348 present situation in the Mideast
sw04154-A_000664-000809 um-hum
sw04154-A_000979-001535 [noise] yeah i'd agree i think i think there's definitely been some changes um and i think you know the
sw04154-A_001535-002089 the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on on the situation
sw04154-A_002089-002259 um
sw04154-A_002259-002433 you know in that
sw04154-A_002433-002680 there's there's not you kn[ow]- there you know if
sw04154-A_002680-003149 you know it's basically since the end of World War II there was always you know that little proxy war going on
sw04154-A_003149-003341 you know with um
sw04154-A_003341-003676 the US funding Israel and you had the um
sw04154-A_003676-003943 Soviet Union funding the Arab countries
sw04154-A_004373-004495 yeah
sw04154-A_004495-004809 um-hum yeah but on the same token you know
sw04154-A_004809-005492 Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the US in being you know the foothold of capitalism
sw04154-A_005492-005668 you know in
sw04154-A_005668-005849 in the Mideast
sw04154-A_006261-006382 um-hum
sw04154-A_006591-006706 um-hum
sw04154-A_007280-007400 um-hum
sw04154-A_007968-008098 um-hum
sw04154-A_009543-009674 um-hum
sw04154-A_009674-009881 [noise]
sw04154-A_009881-010101 yeah but on the other hand you know if
sw04154-A_010201-010486 they would've had a hard time retaliating because
sw04154-A_010486-010955 the[y]- you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
sw04154-A_010955-011528 they basically would've you know had a had a f[ly]- they'd had they would've had had to fly through you know two enemies
sw04154-A_011827-012139 the US had claimed that they would have not given them to them
sw04154-A_012139-012323 i mean of course you know
sw04154-A_012323-012570 public statements can be taken for
sw04154-A_012714-012836 um-hum
sw04154-A_012948-013034 do you
sw04154-A_014179-014335 um-hum [noise]
sw04154-A_014436-014558 you know it
sw04154-A_014558-014695 [noise]
sw04154-A_014695-015497 well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what what the US's motives were in uh in in in actually the original involvement
sw04154-A_015497-015695 um [noise] i've
sw04154-A_015695-016098 the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for
sw04154-A_016098-016279 uh um
sw04154-A_016279-016697 the the domestic political situation than for anything else
sw04154-A_016697-017113 you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president
sw04154-A_017113-017433 um i mean i really i really think that that
sw04154-A_017562-018101 my gut feeling is that that that you know he pretty much picked picked a fight with um
sw04154-A_018101-018719 with um Hussein i mean i'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge[t]- enter that fight
sw04154-A_018719-018908 but i- i think i think that
sw04154-A_019057-019220 that um
sw04154-A_019220-019533 we chose to have our official feelings hurt
sw04154-A_019533-019689 we're a lot [vocalized-noise]
sw04154-A_020184-020385 i think i mean i thought
sw04154-A_020385-020562 i think that
sw04154-A_020562-020706 um
sw04154-A_020900-021266 in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
sw04154-A_021266-021557 and i- i really don't i really don't think that
sw04154-A_021762-022401 i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than
sw04154-A_022401-022689 true foreign policy interests
sw04154-A_022689-022848 um
sw04154-A_023160-023272 yeah
sw04154-A_023272-023521 and i mean in in in along those line since
sw04154-A_023626-024225 since you know it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh
sw04154-A_024225-024434 the Iraqis out of Kuwait
sw04154-A_024434-024628 i just don['t]- i just don't
sw04154-A_024799-025094 i- i- i- d[on't]- i- i- i don't foresee
sw04154-A_025094-025590 Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and
sw04154-A_025590-025880 you know i[n]- in fighting a second battle
sw04154-A_025880-026039 um
sw04154-A_026170-026405 you know over over the um
sw04154-A_026528-027045 o[ver]- over what what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically
sw04154-A_027385-027523 um-hum
sw04154-A_028611-028991 well i have i have very mixed feelings about Israel um
sw04154-A_028991-029162 i think that
sw04154-A_029363-029707 that for a long while we've we've had almost a
sw04154-A_029707-029895 you know h[ad]- had this
sw04154-B_000000-000078 [noise]
sw04154-B_000339-000740 well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is
sw04154-B_000740-000901 what do you think Mark
sw04154-B_002014-002152 oh yeah
sw04154-B_003076-003217 um-hum
sw04154-B_003962-004594 and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much or supplied with arms the same way
sw04154-B_005452-005577 um-hum
sw04154-B_005849-006624 well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves you know we s[upport]- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet
sw04154-B_006624-007710 overall tend to support them_1 but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh
sw04154-B_007710-008218 the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh Scud missiles that were
sw04154-B_008218-009604 uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the US
sw04154-B_010908-011057 i see
sw04154-B_011475-011808 uh you don't think they've got the codes from the US already
sw04154-B_012049-012196 i see
sw04154-B_012510-012822 that's true [laughter] they can can't they
sw04154-B_012822-013358 yeah well what do you what about this situation with uh you know the uh
sw04154-B_013358-014224 continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the in uh arms inspectors have free access
sw04154-B_015408-015548 um-hum

sw04154-B_018660-018789 right
sw04154-B_019475-020032 um-hum well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh
sw04154-B_020032-020352 you know move on into Kuwait and see what happened
sw04154-B_021216-021349 um-hum
sw04154-B_022588-022719 right
sw04154-B_022719-022842 [noise]
sw04154-B_022842-023281 yeah well may have been you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh
sw04154-B_023281-023381 it
sw04154-B_024407-024528 right
sw04154-B_025815-025937 no
sw04154-B_027071-027434 no it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there
sw04154-B_027434-027626 even at this point
sw04154-B_027626-027899 yeah well what about uh
sw04154-B_027899-028745 do you have any any views on uh Israel's relation to the US do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country or what do you

sw04155-A_000866-001072 [noise] what do you do
sw04155-A_001174-001582 i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in

sw04155-A_008167-008333 um-hum
sw04155-A_008333-008581 i'm sure [laughter]
sw04155-A_008802-009148 [laughter]
sw04155-A_010259-010546 i went uh well i did work um
sw04155-A_010546-011135 just various jobs for some time but i- i didn't make enough money to really
sw04155-A_011135-011435 make too much of a difference right
sw04155-A_012381-012548 no no i haven't
sw04155-A_012815-012939 um-hum
sw04155-A_014798-014927 um-hum

sw04155-A_021625-022300 no no i haven't uh i uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition
sw04155-A_022300-022699 so uh i'm i haven't made use of that
sw04155-A_022831-022951 physics
sw04155-A_023164-023552 [laughter] [laughter-everybody] says that [laughter]
sw04155-A_023552-023700 [laughter]
sw04155-A_023700-023886 um
sw04155-A_023886-024074 [laughter]
sw04155-A_024705-025344 um i haven't i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet actually um
sw04155-A_025512-026345 [noise] the the degree i'm getting is physics there's a different one for applied physics so i guess you could call it more straight stuff
sw04155-A_026345-026548 than applied
sw04155-A_026809-026999 [laughter]
sw04155-A_027113-027597 i doubt about that are are is America i mean are we pretty
sw04155-A_027597-027876 pretty steep compared to most countries
sw04155-A_028055-028274 nah i don't think so either
sw04155-A_028274-028425 um-hum
sw04155-A_028425-028565 um-hum
sw04155-A_028565-028742 um-hum
sw04155-A_028988-029114 yeah
sw04155-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04155-B_000202-000523 taxes do we pay too much
sw04155-B_000736-000932 well do we
sw04155-B_001071-001200 um
sw04155-B_001548-002549 my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children
sw04155-B_002549-002803 and i pay a lot on property taxes
sw04155-B_002803-003730 i don't have any um i don't you know i don't use an awful lot of city services it it you know [noise] it's like i have to work
sw04155-B_003730-004230 but uh i have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes
sw04155-B_004230-004711 and um y[ou]- there's so many people who wanted a [dib/bit] of the federal money
sw04155-B_004711-005444 or the state money or whatever it is and i just sometimes many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes
sw04155-B_005444-005728 how about_1 you do you pay too much
sw04155-B_007549-007684 well when you
sw04155-B_007792-008012 when you go out into the uh
sw04155-B_008012-009016 when you go out into the working world i[t]- it it changes quickly um you look at your paycheck and you go oh my gosh where did it all go [laughter]
sw04155-B_009016-009394 um what kind of what kind of uh
sw04155-B_009394-010333 well have you paid a lot of in ta[xes]- have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you did you go directly from high school into into college
sw04155-B_011163-011327 to worry about it
sw04155-B_011430-011875 have you have you been active in in politics trying to
sw04155-B_011875-012444 [noise] concerning this have you like worked on a political action committees or something like that
sw04155-B_012550-012977 i uh i haven't done any of that type of work myself um
sw04155-B_012977-014087 but every once in a while when i hear up here at at um in DC area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress um
sw04155-B_014087-014842 [noise] Congress has added too towards a Members Bank there you know there's a bank that they all bank with and i guess it went defunct recently
sw04155-B_014842-015500 and one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years al[most]- about a thousand bad checks
sw04155-B_015500-016459 and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho[se]- all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule
sw04155-B_016459-017304 and um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to DC anyway it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur
sw04155-B_017304-018075 um i- i- i think we pay too much and i've i look at my paycheck and i make
sw04155-B_018075-018891 well let's see they take out in state and federal taxes i think i pay
sw04155-B_018891-019145 forty two percent
sw04155-B_019145-019464 forty two cents out of every dollar i make goes to
sw04155-B_019464-020583 the government and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes and they charge me all these others and it's just too expensive i can't believe that
sw04155-B_020583-020959 i- i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for
sw04155-B_020959-021135 you know what i mean
sw04155-B_021135-021675 do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
sw04155-B_022678-022845 what are you studying down there
sw04155-B_023002-023339 physics ooh that sounds like a fun fun field [noise]
sw04155-B_023439-023573 [laughter]
sw04155-B_023573-024310 scientific [laughter] heavy science are you like in the particle particle research or
sw04155-B_024310-024738 anything like that or is it more um applied physics
sw04155-B_026313-027226 okay well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's [vocalized-noise] rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward
sw04155-B_027874-028127 actually i don't think we are
sw04155-B_028127-028338 um like like Europe
sw04155-B_028338-028470 um England
sw04155-B_028470-028700 i know the taxes are a lot higher
sw04155-B_028700-029073 but they do have socialized medicine and things like that
sw04155-B_029073-029609 and um i know th[at]- i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um
sw04155-B_029609-029856 they're talking or maybe it was on the radi[o]-
sw04156-A_000000-000005 [noise]
sw04156-A_000005-000400 so uh do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah
sw04156-A_000649-000826 oh
sw04156-A_000826-001350 so you you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card
sw04156-A_001549-001673 uh-huh
sw04156-A_001899-002524 how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh
sw04156-A_003150-003297 okay
sw04156-A_004197-004964 okay um so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid
sw04156-A_005066-005172 uh-huh
sw04156-A_005431-005573 uh-huh
sw04156-A_006131-006802 okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uh-huh go ahead
sw04156-A_007198-007350 uh-huh
sw04156-A_007530-007969 okay and uh what happens then when you don't
sw04156-A_008077-008249 have extra money [laughter]
sw04156-A_008399-008550 oh okay
sw04156-A_008550-008748 oh uh-huh
sw04156-A_009899-010049 uh-huh
sw04156-A_010250-010400 uh-huh
sw04156-A_010576-011399 oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey i'm willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on
sw04156-A_011399-011580 clothing or
sw04156-A_011680-011800 uh-huh
sw04156-A_012100-012249 uh-huh
sw04156-A_012499-012619 uh-huh
sw04156-A_012619-012949 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04156-A_012949-013078 uh-huh
sw04156-A_013500-013650 uh-huh
sw04156-A_014299-014799 so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on
sw04156-A_014799-015072 groceries that you expect to spend for each month
sw04156-A_015072-015922 okay and things like um now some some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance
sw04156-A_016074-016250 uh-huh
sw04156-A_016250-016384 uh-huh
sw04156-A_016485-016847 so you have an entry for each month for those things
sw04156-A_016847-016981 uh-huh
sw04156-A_018076-018232 uh-huh
sw04156-A_018232-018901 and and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or
sw04156-A_019249-019368 uh-huh
sw04156-A_019683-019817 uh-huh
sw04156-A_020100-020249 uh-huh
sw04156-A_020549-020670 uh-huh
sw04156-A_021148-021879 uh-huh so now what about the uh long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff
sw04156-A_021879-022021 uh-huh
sw04156-A_022399-022549 uh-huh
sw04156-A_023199-023400 uh-huh
sw04156-A_023550-023700 that sounds great
sw04156-A_023700-024199 um so now what exactly in an annuity i've always found those a little confusing
sw04156-A_024599-024753 okay
sw04156-A_025372-025726 okay now do you pay taxes on the interest
sw04156-A_025900-026150 okay only when you draw it out
sw04156-A_026150-026299 okay
sw04156-A_026599-026752 uh-huh
sw04156-A_027798-028346 [noise] you mean from the you mean from taxes or fr[om]- from the federal government you mean uh-huh
sw04156-A_029546-029907 okay now i guess the question is is it better than an
sw04156-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04156-B_000200-000329 yeah
sw04156-B_000329-000770 i i'm one of those people who keep a record of everything [laughter]
sw04156-B_000770-000926 [laughter]
sw04156-B_001128-001275 yeah
sw04156-B_001275-001949 and all the A T M transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them_1 and
sw04156-B_002328-003250 i- i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year
sw04156-B_003250-004300 and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for
sw04156-B_004749-004881 right
sw04156-B_004881-006225 unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on March fourth i'll just i'll put it in the folder with March and that way when i get paid in March i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month
sw04156-B_006500-006750 right and that
sw04156-B_006750-007578 and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not
sw04156-B_007978-008149 when i don't what
sw04156-B_008250-008629 [laughter] then i don't do anything [laughter] i've got two little boys
sw04156-B_008629-008899 so i'm at home most of the time anyways but
sw04156-B_008899-010346 like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but it's something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids
sw04156-B_010346-010649 because_1 you're always got to have money when you have [laughter-kids]
sw04156-B_011378-011729 well i have a i have a running budget for every month
sw04156-B_011729-013048 and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kid's pediatrician
sw04156-B_013048-013600 uh my Visa bill yo[u]- you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget
sw04156-B_013600-014350 and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if there's not then i know that m[oney]- the rest of the money is mine
sw04156-B_014450-014579 oh yes
sw04156-B_014828-014979 right
sw04156-B_014979-015123 right
sw04156-B_015824-016550 right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and you've got to figure that in too
sw04156-B_016777-018250 right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them_1 and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so i'm expecting it
sw04156-B_018250-018399 [laughter]
sw04156-B_018828-020172 no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in that month because_1 after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance
sw04156-B_020172-020646 or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month
sw04156-B_020646-021248 i could pay with that hundred and fifty dollars and then what's [vocalized-noise] left i can do wha[t]- what i want with
sw04156-B_021700-022503 well i've got an annuity fund set up because_1 i don't know uh just the way i was raised i look toward the future
sw04156-B_022503-023347 not only for my kids but for myself and i've got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond
sw04156-B_023347-023672 every since they have been born i've been doing that
sw04156-B_023672-023824 so
sw04156-B_024148-025401 an annuity is an account it's like a uh it['s]- it's a type of savings account okay but you don't touch it you just deposit money into it but you don't touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement
sw04156-B_025773-025949 not right now
sw04156-B_025949-026075 if
sw04156-B_026075-026200 right
sw04156-B_026200-027198 and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an IRA account and they get special discounts on like the um
sw04156-B_027198-027900 what's the word i'm trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an IRA they get special rates on it and stuff
sw04156-B_028026-028183 right
sw04156-B_028183-029023 right for the elderly people and stuff that have IRAs set up and they get special discounts on that but an an annuity is
sw04156-B_029023-029649 it's a savings account that you don't withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it
sw04157-A_000000-000009 [noise]
sw04157-A_000009-000100 um
sw04157-A_000100-000250 [noise] so what do you think
sw04157-A_000534-000604 uh-huh
sw04157-A_001298-001469 uh-huh
sw04157-A_001849-001981 right
sw04157-A_002829-002974 right
sw04157-A_004249-004400 oh really
sw04157-A_005973-006168 hum
sw04157-A_007228-007381 um-hum
sw04157-A_008022-008175 uh-huh
sw04157-A_009225-009375 hum
sw04157-A_009748-009871 right
sw04157-A_010000-010150 right
sw04157-A_011394-012534 yeah i that is uh that is something i've heard i- i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from Sweden and that was
sw04157-A_012534-013448 uh probably the m[ajor]- the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of
sw04157-A_013448-014316 of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time
sw04157-A_014316-014983 um it's real hard i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so [noise]
sw04157-A_014983-015873 you know i'm real [noise] you [laughter-know] it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to
sw04157-A_015873-016199 uh the the competition i[n]-
sw04157-A_016199-017073 in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh
sw04157-A_017073-017773 they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a
sw04157-A_017773-018712 you know they're regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for
sw04157-A_018712-019998 my i have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because_1 they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um
sw04157-A_019998-021323 you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is um abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and
sw04157-A_021323-021726 i don't think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
sw04157-A_021899-023305 i[t]- yeah and so i[t]- i[t]- it's i think i to me i think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um
sw04157-A_023305-024449 uh and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and and you've got to
sw04157-A_024449-025750 uh keep up or you've got to realize that you know uh it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and
sw04157-A_025750-025871 [vocalized-noise]
sw04157-A_025871-026684 you know i[f]- if people you know uh there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just
sw04157-A_026684-027398 don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't
sw04157-A_027398-028027 say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um
sw04157-A_028027-028847 i don't know i- i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um
sw04157-A_028847-029578 i[n]- in the in the last number of years and i think that's something that if if they could work on
sw04157-A_029578-029885 the cause of that and [vocalized-noise]
sw04157-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04157-B_000226-001401 um i li[ved]- i lived in Sweden for two years and in Sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good [noise] and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program
sw04157-B_001401-001897 uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
sw04157-B_001897-002947 so it's a very it's a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life
sw04157-B_002947-004297 um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden
sw04157-B_004297-004877 because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but
sw04157-B_004877-006048 uh if you're [noise] if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that
sw04157-B_006048-006800 also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh
sw04157-B_006800-007903 i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably
sw04157-B_007903-009025 middle-class housing there um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so
sw04157-B_009025-009303 their their incomes were about the same
sw04157-B_009303-010067 whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that that didn't exist in Sweden
sw04157-B_010067-010923 and uh overall i gue[ss]- their their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was
sw04157-B_010923-011649 less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver [laughter-type] job then a then a doctor type job
sw04157-B_019929-020050 right
sw04157-B_021173-021398 you don't think it's abnormal
sw04157-B_021632-021978 oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common
sw04157-B_028849-029024 yes
sw04158-A_000000-000200 [noise] so um are you working right now
sw04158-A_000599-000738 uh
sw04158-A_000854-001111 what kind of what kind of work do you do
sw04158-A_001585-001699 um-hum
sw04158-A_002201-002324 ah
sw04158-A_002324-002588 what is that how you heard about this thing
sw04158-A_002588-002739 uh
sw04158-A_002739-003214 uh-huh me too i work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute
sw04158-A_003214-003666 um i'm a co-op student so i work and go to school about halftime
sw04158-A_003666-004147 and uh i really don't have any job benefits to speak of we're kind of
sw04158-A_004147-004245 um
sw04158-A_004348-004813 i don't know they just kind of forget us on that end we don't really have any vacation or
sw04158-A_004813-005172 you know sick days or health care or anything really so
sw04158-A_005539-005962 exactly exactly what about you
sw04158-A_008650-008763 hm
sw04158-A_008883-009008 yeah
sw04158-A_009469-010369 uh they do that i think if you're uh research title staff here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that
sw04158-A_010369-011703 um they might you know pay for that pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by any kind of percentage you know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you wanna finish you wanna
sw04158-A_011703-012894 yeah if they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if if you wanna get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so
sw04158-A_012894-013125 that'll probably help out but
sw04158-A_014178-014445 do you get any kind of health care type stuff
sw04158-A_015028-015150 uh-huh
sw04158-A_015528-015632 yeah
sw04158-A_015735-016085 yeah i think i mean that's pretty i[mportant]- that's a pretty important uh
sw04158-A_016085-016677 part of it there because_1 that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on
sw04158-A_016677-017069 with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works but
sw04158-A_017069-017416 it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own
sw04158-A_018696-018828 uh-huh
sw04158-A_018968-019150 [laughter-yes]
sw04158-A_019904-020581 the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean
sw04158-A_020581-020933 i'm learning and stuff because i'm at you know in school but
sw04158-A_020933-021213 there's there's some weird law where um
sw04158-A_021213-021732 um student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax
sw04158-A_021732-021868 though
sw04158-A_021868-022235 that's about five percent right there so
sw04158-A_022235-022499 that's about the only real bonus
sw04158-A_022499-023233 i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid rela[tive]- you know because_1 if i was working somewhere else i'd have to
sw04158-A_023233-023522 you know pay an extra five percent or so
sw04158-A_024501-024622 hm
sw04158-A_024976-025115 yeah
sw04158-A_026762-026920 oh yeah
sw04158-A_027232-027352 um-hum
sw04158-A_027862-028070 yeah i imagine that'd help a lot
sw04158-A_028372-029274 [laughter-yeah] see around around here it's like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
sw04158-A_029274-029818 [noise] a there's not there's not a whole lot of you know funded research from
sw04158-B_000000-000119 [noise]
sw04158-B_000119-000837 [noise] uh yes i am i'm working in the computer science department here uh at CMU
sw04158-B_001062-002073 uh i'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech
sw04158-B_002073-002367 for the speech group uh here
sw04158-B_002493-002851 [noise] yeah actually through electronic mail
sw04158-B_003144-003270 um-hum
sw04158-B_005051-006104 [laughter] right so your pretty they're they've got you slaving away at [laughter-at] [laughter-this] [laughter-point] [noise] yeah well um
sw04158-B_006104-006230 [noise]
sw04158-B_006230-006780 i'm research staff here now so what they they have uh
sw04158-B_006780-007647 um okay benefits package it's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant um
sw04158-B_007647-008502 benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um
sw04158-B_008502-009527 and they pay for you know pay for the classes so for Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit
sw04158-B_010682-010801 um-hum
sw04158-B_011568-011786 if you wanted to do it quickly
sw04158-B_012816-013024 um-hum um-hum
sw04158-B_013024-013343 yeah yeah so i
sw04158-B_013343-013661 i don't know in in terms of other things
sw04158-B_013661-014035 other benefits other than sort of monetary i'd
sw04158-B_014035-014206 you know i
sw04158-B_014352-014851 yeah we we do we have to contribute a certain amount
sw04158-B_014851-015053 uh to it
sw04158-B_015053-015491 [noise] and it's kind of split between CMU and
sw04158-B_015491-015739 and you know the employee
sw04158-B_017051-017185 right
sw04158-B_017410-017793 y[eah]- yeah and it's also right now it's uh
sw04158-B_017793-018312 [noise] the like everywhere else uh here in Pittsburgh the health care
sw04158-B_018312-018750 uh rates are are going up pretty quickly
sw04158-B_018750-019024 [laughter] that's a whole nother topic
sw04158-B_019024-019255 [laughter] to begin with too but
sw04158-B_019255-019785 yeah but it's you're right i- i- i really agree that that that's pretty important
sw04158-B_020729-020866 right
sw04158-B_020866-021020 right
sw04158-B_021020-021132 [noise]
sw04158-B_021442-021563 um-hum
sw04158-B_021563-021669 [noise]
sw04158-B_021669-022139 [laughter-oh] now that's a big win [laughter]
sw04158-B_022139-022421 yeah yeah uh that's
sw04158-B_022421-022563 yeah
sw04158-B_023395-024005 yeah i figured for [noise] and they've just raised the
sw04158-B_024005-025044 um income caps on Social Security to the point [laughter-where] you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying
sw04158-B_025044-025799 paying that as well yeah well if you could call it a benefit that CMU
sw04158-B_025799-026024 i mean the the other thing
sw04158-B_026024-026838 that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies
sw04158-B_026838-027084 um so that's
sw04158-B_027084-027868 that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with [noise] contacts in industry
sw04158-B_027868-028522 you know in case you know in case you ever need to [noise] bail out [laughter]
sw04158-B_029196-029338 um-hum [noise]
sw04159-A_000000-000460 [noise] okay so uh Mike what are your opinions on uh trial by jury
sw04159-A_003080-004350 um-hum yeah that that seems to make sense that leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different incidents [vocalized-noise]
sw04159-A_005535-005657 um-hum
sw04159-A_006953-007076 right
sw04159-A_007584-007798 right tha[t]- they have to
sw04159-A_008149-008242 right
sw04159-A_008706-008834 well
sw04159-A_008834-009415 how do you feel about setting like well for example a a car type accident where
sw04159-A_009415-010359 uh or some incident where someone loses a limb do you think that jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts it
sw04159-A_012493-012609 um-hum
sw04159-A_013798-013896 [noise]
sw04159-A_014210-014320 hm
sw04159-A_015475-015610 um-hum
sw04159-A_015919-016105 yeah right
sw04159-A_017011-017094 yeah
sw04159-A_017519-017678 that's true
sw04159-A_019089-019184 hm
sw04159-A_019474-019647 oh out of their
sw04159-A_019647-019957 as opposed to the corpora[tion]- insurance paying the bills
sw04159-A_019957-020070 type thing
sw04159-A_020070-020254 uh-huh well we're
sw04159-A_020893-021000 wh[at]-
sw04159-A_021000-021506 who who do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work
sw04159-A_021674-021901 oh okay your talking about corpor[ate]-
sw04159-A_021901-022031 sure
sw04159-A_022763-022888 okay
sw04159-A_022888-023032 well
sw04159-A_023032-023757 but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
sw04159-A_026047-026136 okay_1
sw04159-A_026136-026250 for oh [vocalized-noise]
sw04159-A_026446-026562 um-hum
sw04159-A_027133-027253 um-hum
sw04159-A_027371-027541 right they don't
sw04159-A_027808-027908 hm
sw04159-A_029490-029625 sure
sw04159-A_029625-029756 okay_1
sw04159-B_000000-000058 [noise]
sw04159-B_000438-001332 well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided um
sw04159-B_001332-002086 by juries particularly and i know in England the judges set all of the awards you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence
sw04159-B_002086-002292 but then they leave the
sw04159-B_002292-003220 awards up to more learned people and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars [laughter]
sw04159-B_004139-004729 oh exactly [noise] each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um
sw04159-B_004843-005631 the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range
sw04159-B_005631-005891 when you get one way out like that
sw04159-B_005891-007004 that then really doesn't penali[ze]- wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us
sw04159-B_007004-007660 if they get some of those mega awards against them you know they're not going to sit there and lose money if they're losing money then they're going to raise rates
sw04159-B_007660-008224 so it all comes filtering down to us all i[ndividually]- i[ndividually]- individually
sw04159-B_008224-008714 and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
sw04159-B_008714-008842 you know
sw04159-B_010266-010769 i don't know you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh
sw04159-B_010769-012101 if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s[pecifies]- pre specifies in the policy uh so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a [noise] a value on somebody's limb
sw04159-B_012101-012690 uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases i think maybe
sw04159-B_012690-013710 you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with
sw04159-B_013710-014272 with that i mean maybe you don't award an eighty five year old guy the same thing that you'd award a twenty one year old
sw04159-B_014272-014975 i- i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and that may be where the judiciary is a little more
sw04159-B_014975-016344 learned about that s[tuff]- type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing and it could be part of continuing education maybe for judges [laughter] i don't know you know to get into the economics of things uh
sw04159-B_016344-017570 because_1 if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying to get anyway
sw04159-B_017570-018444 if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance
sw04159-B_018444-019063 which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages i think those should be uninsurable
sw04159-B_019063-019695 i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage
sw04159-B_019897-020038 yeah
sw04159-B_020038-020151 yeah
sw04159-B_020151-021112 for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens one of their employees causes damage or something sure that's what they buy insurance for but
sw04159-B_021422-021677 well i was just talking about any company
sw04159-B_021677-023142 uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them_1 sure insurance should pay for that
sw04159-B_023648-025062 well i'm not talking about any loss i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they're due
sw04159-B_025062-026471 and then they're awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l[ot]- usually a lot less but it's uh an amount their designed to sting them_1 a little for their negligence for gross wanton negligence in a claim
sw04159-B_026471-027177 and unfortunately the j[ury]- the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
sw04159-B_027177-027890 so again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to
sw04159-B_027890-028631 and if they if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the
sw04159-B_028631-029682 you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
sw04159-B_029682-029984 then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
sw04160-A_000000-000013 [noise]
sw04160-A_000013-000199 so do you keep a family budget
sw04160-A_001246-002158 that's a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i- i don't um
sw04160-A_002158-003167 so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh
sw04160-A_003167-004600 we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i don't keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did
sw04160-A_004600-005599 and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we don't have that to spend that appears to work pretty well
sw04160-A_010180-010350 um-hum
sw04160-A_010481-011072 [noise] do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet
sw04160-A_011448-011599 [noise]
sw04160-A_011749-012399 we've got uh a couple of those but uh i've been trying to ge[t]- get my wife sold on a spreadsheet
sw04160-A_012399-013048 and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um
sw04160-A_013048-014421 she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says it's just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic
sw04160-A_014421-014546 so
sw04160-A_015901-016724 w[ell]- that's kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like she's
sw04160-A_016724-017400 you know if if she did do it for a couple months she'd probably like it but she was just that
sw04160-A_018500-019928 um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what we're making and we've been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference
sw04160-A_019928-020100 goes
sw04160-A_020100-020921 uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month
sw04160-A_020921-021454 [laughter] with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it it's not going to be enough anyway
sw04160-A_021454-022799 and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all we've been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we haven't been investing or anything like that uh
sw04160-A_022799-023900 yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but
sw04160-A_023900-024369 we uh you know we even with all that we're still able to put some aside
sw04160-A_024369-024599 how about you
sw04160-A_027898-029027 well it's it's nice to have something you know people say that if you're if you're not saving money you're spending more than you earn and uh that's probably the case
sw04160-A_029027-029571 you know you never can live down to the last dime so you're either coming out ahead or coming out behind
sw04160-B_000000-000098 [noise]
sw04160-B_000098-000728 well not a real strict one but we do work hard at saving for the future
sw04160-B_000728-001248 and do that primarily through uh payroll reduction at my employment
sw04160-B_002050-002195 uh-huh
sw04160-B_002548-002821 [laughter]
sw04160-B_004526-004645 uh-huh
sw04160-B_005599-006275 i actually use a computer to keep track of our family uh expenses
sw04160-B_006275-007650 i enter all the all the checks that we write and most of the cash that we spend and all the credit card transactions into a computer program that and keeps track of where all of our expenses go
sw04160-B_007650-008250 and every few months i look at that to get an overall idea of of uh
sw04160-B_008250-009319 how our expenses compare to my income and make sure that we're not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area
sw04160-B_009319-010497 and try and figure out for the for the year whether we're going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time
sw04160-B_010999-011372 uh it's a specialized personal finance program
sw04160-B_011474-011799 and it seems to seems to work real well
sw04160-B_012349-012470 uh-huh
sw04160-B_012878-012974 huh
sw04160-B_014348-015500 yeah i think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh
sw04160-B_015500-015978 you know the the nice record keeping that it gives you is worth a little bit of extra time
sw04160-B_017121-017272 right
sw04160-B_017426-017548 right
sw04160-B_017750-018549 do you have any uh any particular ways that that feeds into your long-term uh savings or retirement plan
sw04160-B_018799-018950 yeah
sw04160-B_020549-020674 uh-huh
sw04160-B_020829-020981 right
sw04160-B_020981-021130 [laughter]
sw04160-B_021130-021348 have have you
sw04160-B_021348-021547 right
sw04160-B_022419-022532 huh
sw04160-B_023629-023771 [laughter]
sw04160-B_023771-023967 makes it difficult yeah
sw04160-B_024278-024400 yeah
sw04160-B_024549-025650 well i contribute as much as i can to our four O one K plan at work and we also have a a uh company stock purchase plan which i contribute to and
sw04160-B_025650-026997 between those two that's that's pretty much all that we're able to save but fortunately those are fairly substantial and i feel like that's at this point the uh the the most important part of our long-term uh savings plans
sw04160-B_027101-027948 and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that i'll [laughter] be able to get beyond that but right now that's all i'm able to save
sw04160-B_028798-028949 uh-huh
sw04160-B_028949-029098 right
sw04160-B_029475-029649 right
sw04160-B_029649-029930 i know we're just getting started on our family so
sw04161-A_000000-000023 [noise]
sw04161-A_000023-000195 so you keep a budget
sw04161-A_001508-001694 that's your budget eh
sw04161-A_002857-002985 yep
sw04161-A_005258-005383 yeah
sw04161-A_005383-005590 [noise] my uh
sw04161-A_005590-005763 wife and i
sw04161-A_005763-006204 we're new young couple starting out so we've been trying to [noise] budget it's getting a lot
sw04161-A_006204-006660 a lot tighter and we've actually worked out a very extensive year long budget
sw04161-A_006660-007300 so we know exactly what we're gonna spend when and when we're gonna have money and we've worked out a cash flow
sw04161-A_007300-007868 we just bought a house which is another reason why we're really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff
sw04161-A_007868-008328 [laughter] and so we have
sw04161-A_008328-009202 this detailed budget and in some ways it's really kind of nice because there's not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any
sw04161-A_009202-010445 real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a there's a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that we're going to have money to do what we said we're going to do
sw04161-A_010547-011298 yeah we as my brother told me when he he's in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were
sw04161-A_011298-012485 making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and and that's it once a year and that's it because you've worked out the budget and what you're going to spend
sw04161-A_013369-013506 ah
sw04161-A_016599-016763 [laughter]
sw04161-A_016869-017299 doesn't s[ound]- sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out that's gonna work just fine
sw04161-A_017738-017862 yeah
sw04161-A_020936-021067 um-hum
sw04161-A_022568-022690 yeah
sw04161-A_023679-023808 um-hum
sw04161-A_025301-025422 yes
sw04161-A_026411-026840 yeah what we've done see we've only been married three years and i
sw04161-A_026840-027698 my wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything
sw04161-A_027698-027907 and then i come in and help her
sw04161-A_028010-028970 and uh that's been really good because it's you know we've both come to appreciate and understand what's going on and she does most everything now and it's really quite nice actually [laughter]
sw04161-A_028970-029141 and uh
sw04161-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04161-B_000161-000973 [noise] uh not really all i- i just have one commitment and that is that at the end of the month that uh
sw04161-B_000973-001213 that everything is paid
sw04161-B_001213-001613 and that's basically my budget
sw04161-B_001613-002299 so we use credit cards and uh let's see what else and when i get a
sw04161-B_002299-002975 when i get a uh a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately
sw04161-B_002975-003440 put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little Franklin Planner
sw04161-B_003440-003613 and uh
sw04161-B_003613-004317 i carry it around and then on the day that i'm supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much i'm in the hole
sw04161-B_004317-004692 so basically [noise] my budget is uh based on
sw04161-B_004692-004821 [noise]
sw04161-B_004821-005265 [noise] if uh the bank account's low why we don't spend very much
sw04161-B_006610-006755 oh wow
sw04161-B_007528-007672 oh yeah
sw04161-B_007672-008201 [laughter]
sw04161-B_010111-010250 yeah
sw04161-B_010399-010594 now you have a consensus
sw04161-B_010594-010752 ahead of time huh
sw04161-B_011970-012388 [laughter]
sw04161-B_012388-013399 ah that's very good i've i'm uh i- i tried that in the beginning and w[hen]- w[hen]- when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus
sw04161-B_013399-013707 uh we both agreed [noise] that uh
sw04161-B_013707-014690 how shall i say it was the best consensus we could get was uh we're both are pretty thrifty and and uh [noise]
sw04161-B_014690-015761 you know it just we'll just watch our we just won't spend money uh big items we'll [noise] kind of talk to each other about but we have two
sw04161-B_015761-016202 [noise] we're playing uh Russian Roulette i guess although we've been married
sw04161-B_016202-016415 uh how many years now uh
sw04161-B_016415-016523 [noise]
sw04161-B_016523-016700 let's see
sw04161-B_016700-016999 twenty six twenty seven years now
sw04161-B_017248-017755 well it's i[t]- what it is it's just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much
sw04161-B_017755-018112 and uh [noise] so
sw04161-B_018112-018819 the uh but the uh the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if if if we ever
sw04161-B_018819-019392 had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh
sw04161-B_019392-020542 an an emergency of some kind a job uh loss or something like that we'd have to [noise] we'd have to do that but neither one of us [noise]
sw04161-B_020542-021003 are predict[ing]- what what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts
sw04161-B_021003-021295 one i- i wanted to uh
sw04161-B_021400-021880 i wanted her to uh to learn how to balance her checkbook because she's
sw04161-B_021880-022054 she just
sw04161-B_022054-023374 [noise] the the best she can do is is keep it uh current so to speak so what i did was i gave her another checkbook and i said okay y[ou]- uh this is your account you can have money anytime you
sw04161-B_023374-023728 want it just tell me how much is in your account
sw04161-B_023728-024390 [laughter] she said no you are trying to control me i said i'm not you know you can have six hundred dollars in there if you want another three hundred just tell me
sw04161-B_024390-024931 and uh so finally we got we have one of these uh things where we get money
sw04161-B_024931-025315 the company puts makes a direct deposit
sw04161-B_025315-025649 [noise] so i give her
sw04161-B_025649-026387 let's see what [noise] she gets uh like a third of the money for the household and i pay everything else
sw04161-B_027855-028032 i think that's good
sw04161-B_028980-029401 i- i think that's good o[ne]- one of my uh friends suggested that
sw04161-B_029401-029895 that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because
sw04162-A_000000-000230 [noise] well i think um
sw04162-A_000230-001154 for at least for me uh because_1 my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um
sw04162-A_001154-001686 the in the teacher to uh the number of kids
sw04162-A_001686-002148 because if you've got a lo[t]- a large number of children one teacher just won't cut it
sw04162-A_002306-002441 right
sw04162-A_002650-002799 right
sw04162-A_002902-003041 um-hum
sw04162-A_004193-004314 right
sw04162-A_004612-005975 word of mouth is good uh something that i don't think many people know about and i this is just something i've heard not something i've actually e[xperienced]- um checked into is that um the agency that uh that license
sw04162-A_005975-006951 um a[gencies]- agencies to care for kids like ho[me]- either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past
sw04162-A_006951-007156 is what i've been told
sw04162-A_007156-007443 that would be a good a good resource to check
sw04162-A_008286-008429 um-hum
sw04162-A_009100-009232 um-hum
sw04162-A_009232-009378 yeah
sw04162-A_009378-009549 oh yeah
sw04162-A_009549-009695 oh yeah
sw04162-A_010213-010644 yes and in and there's some places i'm sorry go ahead
sw04162-A_010745-011647 right because then there's some places and i w[ould]- and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced
sw04162-A_011647-012198 you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i don't think you know if there hum-um
sw04162-A_012301-012538 no no never
sw04162-A_012953-013087 yes
sw04162-A_013573-014801 and i think you've also got to loo[k]- you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in
sw04162-A_015006-015133 yes
sw04162-A_015802-015998 um-hum um-hum
sw04162-A_017062-017187 um-hum
sw04162-A_017411-017541 yeah
sw04162-A_017854-018505 [noise] no um i like i said my sister's in the process of trying to find one for hers
sw04162-A_018968-019108 um-hum
sw04162-A_019363-019448 right
sw04162-A_019448-019564 right
sw04162-A_019564-020117 an[d]- and that's a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children
sw04162-A_020117-020569 um i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers
sw04162-A_020569-021578 and what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones
sw04162-A_021578-022055 you know and i mean this went on for a su[mmer]- for a you know good two and a half months
sw04162-A_022055-022686 you know and it's her daily thing you know and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home
sw04162-A_022686-023200 sometimes a day c[are]- a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best
sw04162-A_023200-023504 right [noise] right
sw04162-A_023504-024056 so but oh and another one is is how they discipline
sw04162-A_024056-025198 um i know depending a couple of the day cares that that i went to whenever i was younger um one of them_1 disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out
sw04162-A_025198-025715 whereas you know i've heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline
sw04162-A_025715-026212 and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs
sw04162-A_026212-026400 or yeah
sw04162-A_026400-026880 right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child
sw04162-A_026880-027071 so
sw04162-A_027071-027205 oh yeah
sw04162-A_027308-027458 hm
sw04162-A_027458-027721 what about um
sw04162-A_027721-027977 well i'm in i'm in nursing
sw04162-A_027977-028351 so one thing i would look at would be um
sw04162-A_028351-028601 the cleanliness and the care
sw04162-A_028601-028977 the hea[lth]- that's right the certification of the of the t[eachers]- teachers
sw04162-A_028977-029473 because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care
sw04162-A_029473-029752 knows knows infant and child CPR
sw04162-A_029752-029879 but there's a lot of places
sw04162-B_000000-000055 [noise]
sw04162-B_000609-000746 um-hum
sw04162-B_001624-001749 um-hum
sw04162-B_002116-002740 right even if it's in the home i think this is important even if it's a private home situation
sw04162-B_002740-002975 and not a day care
sw04162-B_002975-003607 um probably number one too would be close references
sw04162-B_003607-004241 if you know people that have had the experience at they hands on experience of one
sw04162-B_004241-004498 would be very important
sw04162-B_004498-004671 word of mouth
sw04162-B_004775-004946 um friends
sw04162-B_006818-007051 um-hum um-hum
sw04162-B_007051-007229 um-hum
sw04162-B_007363-008333 right right and all of course better business i would check any of your business um [noise] any type of thing references of that type
sw04162-B_008333-009152 as well as your word of mouth if you were putting them in uh uh school or any day care type you know that's public
sw04162-B_009152-009659 you know what i mean like a church or a school type thing
sw04162-B_009659-009951 i would check that awfully close
sw04162-B_009951-010246 um i'd go in often
sw04162-B_010382-010539 unexpectedly
sw04162-B_010539-010796 unexpectedly wherever they where
sw04162-B_011608-011746 um-hum
sw04162-B_011746-011979 um-hum um-hum
sw04162-B_011979-012435 i wouldn't do that i mean i wouldn't not put my child in there though would you
sw04162-B_012435-013000 you know i would never have a controlled situation not with a little one especially
sw04162-B_013000-013539 you know that's not a not a good situation on that
sw04162-B_014251-014376 um-hum
sw04162-B_014479-014626 um-hum
sw04162-B_014626-015496 um-hum right that's real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of
sw04162-B_015496-016300 research it and get an idea of how they feel about things you know have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all
sw04162-B_016300-016733 kind of how they basically anyway because they you know that's
sw04162-B_016733-017122 um seventy percent your child's life
sw04162-B_017122-017484 you know is developing is there
sw04162-B_017484-017906 so that's real important do you have any children in it yourself
sw04162-B_018110-018383 your sister is um-hum [noise]
sw04162-B_018383-019027 yeah it's a scary thing my daughter's been in Houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold she's had to
sw04162-B_019027-019397 but she's been real fortunately in finding women in their homes
sw04162-B_019397-019546 and uh
sw04162-B_020032-020191 um-hum

sw04162-B_022599-022769 um-hum
sw04162-B_023075-023599 not the best situation yeah yeah that's for sure
sw04162-B_024003-024146 um-hum
sw04162-B_024980-025106 um-hum
sw04162-B_025106-025249 um-hum
sw04162-B_025599-025832 um-hum um-hum

sw04162-B_027152-027294 yeah
sw04162-B_027932-028057 um-hum
sw04162-B_028282-028665 the cleanliness and the care health care
sw04162-B_028665-028905 um-hum um-hum
sw04162-B_028905-029045 right
sw04162-B_029399-029531 um-hum
sw04162-B_029700-029824 right
sw04163-A_000000-000034 [noise]
sw04163-A_000034-000685 it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent
sw04163-A_000685-001420 um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
sw04163-A_001420-002199 but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean
sw04163-A_002615-002768 oh wow
sw04163-A_004210-004348 right
sw04163-A_005137-006440 there is that i mean well and then i guess again i- i gue[ss]- like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
sw04163-A_006440-007051 um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's w[ould]- it's also nice to be able to uh
sw04163-A_007051-007793 know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if you're not there it doesn't happen
sw04163-A_008195-008322 yeah
sw04163-A_008866-009245 oh wow oh wow
sw04163-A_009666-009830 um-hum
sw04163-A_009830-010750 you know one other benefit that tha[t]- just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in [noise] sometimes big companies will pay for like education
sw04163-A_010750-011835 i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing
sw04163-A_011835-012010 you know but uh
sw04163-A_012177-012308 uh-huh
sw04163-A_013134-013269 uh-huh
sw04163-A_013409-013557 yeah
sw04163-A_013699-013942 [laughter]
sw04163-A_013942-014026 yeah
sw04163-A_014026-015138 yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to
sw04163-A_015138-015563 um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast
sw04163-A_015563-016586 and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
sw04163-A_016586-017334 of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess y[ou're]- you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
sw04163-A_017334-018052 so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for
sw04163-A_018169-018756 things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids
sw04163-A_018756-019001 [noise] bigger companies might have something like that
sw04163-A_019102-020018 and uh um [noise] like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if th[ey]- if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites
sw04163-A_020018-020695 um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country
sw04163-A_021485-021644 [laughter]
sw04163-A_023191-023990 [vocalized-noise] which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not
sw04163-A_025562-025806 oh you had family in San Antonio
sw04163-A_025806-025937 oh
sw04163-A_026371-026496 okay
sw04163-A_027099-027833 [noise] see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company
sw04163-A_027833-028344 [laughter] a number of people but uh although it's getting smaller every every day um
sw04163-A_028344-028956 and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least
sw04163-A_028956-029136 and like i don't know
sw04163-A_029136-029738 i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know
sw04163-A_029738-029955 i ca[n't]- i wouldn't i couldn't [vocalized-noise]
sw04163-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04163-B_001335-001468 yeah
sw04163-B_002041-002699 yeah yeah see i work for a really small company it's just me and my boss [laughter]
sw04163-B_002699-003771 so it's really small and i think it's really nice because you know it's it's real easy we don't really have much to do but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or
sw04163-B_003771-004296 you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but
sw04163-B_004296-005371 but sometimes it's kind of bad because if i'm sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i'm you know have to stay in bed because i'm the only one there yeah
sw04163-B_006347-006493 yeah
sw04163-B_006689-006823 yeah
sw04163-B_007471-007595 yeah
sw04163-B_007705-008913 yeah and al[so]- also in big companies they have uh like vacations and all no if i take a vacation i've got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week
sw04163-B_008913-009750 yeah so [laughter] so it's pretty nice being able to take off and have someone else take your take up your time and all
sw04163-B_009750-009899 so
sw04163-B_010665-010823 oh yeah yeah
sw04163-B_011286-011420 yeah
sw04163-B_011767-011895 yeah
sw04163-B_011895-012621 a friend of mine works for a a stockbroker and um it's a really it's a big company and they said that um
sw04163-B_012621-013175 as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they'll reimburse her
sw04163-B_013175-013472 so that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company
sw04163-B_013472-013789 and that's pretty nice my job won't do that [laughter]
sw04163-B_013789-013961 [laughter]
sw04163-B_015482-015624 yeah
sw04163-B_016511-016639 yeah
sw04163-B_017237-017374 yeah
sw04163-B_018701-018840 yeah that's
sw04163-B_018942-019103 yeah that would be nice
sw04163-B_019973-020098 yeah
sw04163-B_020635-021534 yeah they moved uh my dad worked for i'm not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas
sw04163-B_021534-021676 so [laughter]
sw04163-B_021676-022220 we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all
sw04163-B_022220-023224 i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever
sw04163-B_024026-024983 yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because_1 you know we weren't just living in Dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that
sw04163-B_024983-025639 if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so
sw04163-B_025750-026399 no we had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana
sw04163-B_026399-027125 so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different
sw04163-B_027744-027898 [laughter-yeah]
sw04163-B_028888-029017 yeah
sw04164-A_000000-000037 [noise]
sw04164-A_000037-000199 sounds like you've got this uh
sw04164-A_000199-000442 [noise] sounds like you're ready to take a stab at it so why don't you go ahead
sw04164-A_001183-001349 [noise]
sw04164-A_001565-002660 yeah i happen to uh this will be a real short one cause i happen to agree with you uh [noise] i think in principal it is a very very good thing but when you make it mandatory uh now you're talking about slavery
sw04164-A_002660-003103 [laughter] it comes down to um
sw04164-A_003103-003985 the uh it's kind of fun because i had picked the same topic uh last time i dialed in and uh you know which i didn't know it would do um
sw04164-A_003985-004347 you know one of the uh things they're trying to think of is ways
sw04164-A_004347-005266 you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it uh
sw04164-A_005266-005877 more desired and respected in society for people to voluntarily uh engage in public service
sw04164-A_006731-006852 um-hum
sw04164-A_007248-007416 yeah yeah
sw04164-A_007517-007787 yeah the uh what do you call it um
sw04164-A_007908-008533 not sure how you would do that outside of a government sector though um and uh
sw04164-A_008533-009400 you know i- i kind of hope against reality sadly that uh that government sector will get smaller with time but every indication is that it won't
sw04164-A_009400-009631 [laughter] you know uh
sw04164-A_009631-009757 yeah
sw04164-A_011819-012592 [vocalized-noise] my uh my interpretation of history is is is that uh [noise]
sw04164-A_012592-013781 when there's a real need there's usually no shortage of volunteers you know you look at what happened uh in California with the earthquake there were plenty of people volunteering you know you look at World War Two there were plenty of volunteers
sw04164-A_013781-014203 uh you look at from the war in Vietnam all of a sudden there weren't a whole lot of volunteers
sw04164-A_014203-014403 and uh
sw04164-A_014403-015257 you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on um say for example a draft uh maybe it should be the other way around maybe
sw04164-A_015257-015713 the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not
sw04164-A_015949-017044 yeah cause uh you know if all you got to do is uh print up a few million draft cards to start a war you know [laughter] you it may be a powerful in[centive]- you know what do you call it um
sw04164-A_017044-017952 [vocalized-noise] by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war you know there are times you need to
sw04164-A_017952-018242 i don't perceive myself as a pacifist by any means
sw04164-A_018242-018394 but um
sw04164-A_018394-018860 you know there are probably there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't have
sw04164-A_018860-019646 ah i don't think every time we uh wandered into some place it was honest just in itself i think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else
sw04164-A_020438-020564 indeed
sw04164-A_020751-020872 um
sw04164-A_022524-023199 um [noise] well you know i- i will s[ay]- i given a choice between somebody with expertise and no interest in working
sw04164-A_023199-023989 and someone who is enthusiastic but lacks the skill i'll take the enthusiasm any day cause you can train that person
sw04164-A_023989-024340 but somebody that's got no incentive i- i'm not really sure what you can do
sw04164-A_024655-024855 um no that was before my time
sw04164-A_024979-025079 [laughter]
sw04164-A_025238-025361 uh-huh
sw04164-A_025503-025689 was it like uh WPA
sw04164-A_025794-025916 uh-huh
sw04164-A_026208-026329 um-hum
sw04164-A_026773-026937 yeah yeah
sw04164-A_027369-028035 hm yeah my only concern about projects like that you know there [vocalized-noise] my concern is uh
sw04164-A_028035-028448 [noise] you've got this resource whether it's uh
sw04164-A_028448-029413 unemployed people whether it's volunteers what have you you've got this resource and what is the best way to target where you're going to point it uh
sw04164-A_029413-029853 you know i don't know the answer to that i'm not automatically [vocalized-noise]
sw04164-B_000000-000018 [noise]
sw04164-B_000018-000156 hello Larry
sw04164-B_000156-000283 huh
sw04164-B_000449-001249 okay well i you know i think that uh i think it's fine to do that but i don't think it should be mandatory i'm not
sw04164-B_001249-001601 i'm not for having the equivalent of a draft
sw04164-B_002652-002843 that's right it's uh
sw04164-B_003553-003690 oh is that right
sw04164-B_005040-005164 um-hum
sw04164-B_005802-005952 um-hum
sw04164-B_005952-006919 well i'd say as far as government jobs uh they could uh have some incentive for instance veterans get a preference when they're applying for a government job and i'd say people at
sw04164-B_006919-007373 had voluntarily served in such a thing as the Peace Corps or or something
sw04164-B_007373-007541 could also get that
sw04164-B_008248-008422 i don't know either
sw04164-B_008523-008736 and i'm not sure we'd we'd want it [vocalized-noise]
sw04164-B_009196-009333 huh-uh
sw04164-B_009333-009486 right
sw04164-B_009486-009685 i feel the same way
sw04164-B_009685-010435 uh i think that uh i have nothing against the draft when you know when when the nation needs it
sw04164-B_010435-011182 uh but obviously when you don't need it you don't have a draft and i feel the same thing with universal service if there was a need for it
sw04164-B_011182-011923 then i'd say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening uh
sw04164-B_013368-013493 um-hum
sw04164-B_013719-013850 that's right
sw04164-B_014132-014267 um-hum
sw04164-B_015666-015801 um-hum
sw04164-B_015801-016017 that's that's true

sw04164-B_018881-019010 um-hum
sw04164-B_019550-019671 right
sw04164-B_019671-020035 i think about on on public service too i think it has some
sw04164-B_020035-021298 some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school
sw04164-B_021298-022745 and then offer them assistance with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have any expertise in any particular but uh any particular field but they'd be willing hands so so to speak on public service projects
sw04164-B_023512-023674 um-hum
sw04164-B_023674-023813 right
sw04164-B_023936-024068 um-hum
sw04164-B_024328-024766 are you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the thirties
sw04164-B_024766-025664 okay well i mean it's before my time too but i- i read about it but you know in the height of the depression the government employed people to go work on public service projects
sw04164-B_025664-026622 that's right like WPA it was the same thing and there were many uh a lot of the national parks were built up by the Civilian Conservation Corps and a lot of WPA projects are still
sw04164-B_026622-026835 serving the the nation
sw04164-B_026835-027519 so uh someth[ing]- you know uh unskilled people could could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude
sw04164-B_028910-029040 um-hum
sw04165-A_000000-000072 [noise] Steve this is
sw04165-A_000072-000961 like i mentioned Brian and i guess we're going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
sw04165-A_001446-001586 uh-huh
sw04165-A_001586-001908 [laughter]
sw04165-A_002656-002796 uh-huh
sw04165-A_003299-003454 uh-huh
sw04165-A_004115-004247 right
sw04165-A_004865-005457 uh-huh well uh we're kind of lucky i i'm uh
sw04165-A_005457-006854 i'm working my wife isn't working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh coworkers and associates that are looking
sw04165-A_006854-007918 for child care and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know
sw04165-A_007918-008419 uh guidance counselor to student or you know
sw04165-A_008419-009092 uh adult to child relationship how many you know you don't want to have thirty or [laughter-forty] kids and only one adult
sw04165-A_009092-009815 then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh
sw04165-A_009815-010831 they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh
sw04165-A_010831-011932 we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the
sw04165-A_011932-013113 the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel
sw04165-A_013113-014249 uh that the kids interact with other children also it's a it's a good way to develop yeah relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids
sw04165-A_014249-015042 so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
sw04165-A_016050-016182 uh-huh
sw04165-A_017393-017524 uh-huh

sw04165-A_021470-021651 right right
sw04165-A_022300-023073 i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh
sw04165-A_023073-023939 [noise] i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people
sw04165-A_023939-024831 [noise] and uh you know you hear in the newspa[per]- you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know
sw04165-A_024831-025450 don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and
sw04165-A_025450-026591 hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this [laughter-situation] for awhile so

sw04165-B_000897-002226 well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh [noise] and so you know you go back
sw04165-B_002226-003394 those many years and uh we didn't do it very much and we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time
sw04165-B_003394-004200 and our kids were older but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
sw04165-B_004200-005065 uh so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using how about yourself
sw04165-B_008589-008755 right
sw04165-B_009072-009198 right
sw04165-B_009685-009812 well
sw04165-B_011434-011588 uh-huh
sw04165-B_014881-015347 yeah i [noise] i kind of think that uh
sw04165-B_015347-016467 you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have
sw04165-B_016467-017176 in [vocalized-noise] one sense two forms of uh child care there's where individuals will
sw04165-B_017176-018129 [noise] in one [vocalized-noise] primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
sw04165-B_018129-019319 and then otherwise there will be [noise] the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
sw04165-B_019319-019877 frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and
sw04165-B_019877-021172 [noise] the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some [vocalized-noise] fairly good training programs
sw04165-B_021172-021551 and and some of them formal two year programs
sw04165-B_021551-022331 uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
sw04165-B_023870-024018 [noise] yeah
sw04165-B_026485-027308 yeah [noise] you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and [noise] i guess
sw04165-B_027308-028035 you know it are it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home
sw04165-B_028035-028980 [noise] or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not
sw04165-B_028980-029823 and it's more of a group home rather than actually day care [vocalized-noise] type of facility uh
sw04165-B_029823-029933 so
sw04166-A_000000-001257 [noise] okay_1 uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes and it was uh more like a funeral home i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home
sw04166-A_001257-002280 and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful
sw04166-A_002280-002980 and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was
sw04166-A_002980-003876 an absolute last re[sort]- resort um i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics
sw04166-A_003995-004984 yeah so uh she she's real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing she's Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes and
sw04166-A_004984-005422 i don't know you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor [laughter]
sw04166-A_005568-007013 okay Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing
sw04166-A_007678-007803 right
sw04166-A_008041-008164 um-hum
sw04166-A_008506-008610 um-hum
sw04166-A_009605-009715 oh
sw04166-A_010192-010323 um-hum
sw04166-A_010563-010701 right
sw04166-A_011551-011679 right
sw04166-A_012121-012244 uh-huh
sw04166-A_012821-012968 right
sw04166-A_013516-013649 right
sw04166-A_014316-014438 right
sw04166-A_014672-015378 um-hum it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive
sw04166-A_015378-015866 because because_1 they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
sw04166-A_016866-017051 oh yeah
sw04166-A_017340-018280 right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but um he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
sw04166-A_018280-019312 and someone visited him everyday my grandmother did but uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home
sw04166-A_019312-019856 and uh people didn't get paid much there at all they didn't care about what went on
sw04166-A_019856-020243 they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores
sw04166-A_020243-021210 and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people and
sw04166-A_021210-021919 then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for[th]- forth any loving care for them
sw04166-A_022179-022310 right
sw04166-A_022414-022542 right
sw04166-A_022949-023079 um-hum
sw04166-A_023079-023233 right
sw04166-A_023526-023827 right and the nurses get so worn down
sw04166-A_024543-024633 right
sw04166-A_024992-025242 oh sure and they feel
sw04166-A_025242-025475 they feel pretty helpless
sw04166-A_026246-026498 is it uh like a retirement center
sw04166-A_026750-026870 uh-huh
sw04166-A_027060-027190 uh-huh
sw04166-A_027648-027769 uh-huh
sw04166-A_027924-028123 how's he handling that
sw04166-A_028478-028609 um-hum
sw04166-A_028941-029051 oh
sw04166-A_029338-029764 oh sure there wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida
sw04166-B_000000-000059 [noise]
sw04166-B_003861-004051 well that sounds good
sw04166-B_005350-005637 i've heard the name and that's about all it goes
sw04166-B_007004-007744 yeah that's one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
sw04166-B_007744-008574 um you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on
sw04166-B_008574-008826 and it can be pretty sad i've
sw04166-B_008826-009666 got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
sw04166-B_009666-010241 and you know it's the the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my families was up in Maryland
sw04166-B_010241-010635 and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state
sw04166-B_010635-011197 and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was
sw04166-B_011197-011619 um you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
sw04166-B_011619-011891 and you know the nursing home was the
sw04166-B_011891-012157 you know best facility to put her in
sw04166-B_012157-012923 you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
sw04166-B_012923-013626 which means it's you know very difficult for some[one]- you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time
sw04166-B_013626-014401 and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in home
sw04166-B_014401-014778 which makes it you know it's it's a necessary evil i think
sw04166-B_015387-015483 yeah
sw04166-B_015910-016938 yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
sw04166-B_016938-017430 and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
sw04166-B_019258-019349 uh-huh
sw04166-B_019827-019911 yeah
sw04166-B_020191-020305 uh-huh
sw04166-B_021841-022467 either that or they're just so understaffed that they uh can't afford to put in the uh care that they need
sw04166-B_022467-022775 because_1 it's you know an elderly person can
sw04166-B_022775-023169 you know it's like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care
sw04166-B_023169-023564 uh answering all the needs because_1 they can't do much for themselves at certain points
sw04166-B_023794-023944 uh-huh
sw04166-B_023944-024585 and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
sw04166-B_024585-025033 and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
sw04166-B_025033-025339 and it very very hard for them to accept that
sw04166-B_025535-025932 we just uh moved my grandfather into
sw04166-B_025932-026317 not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
sw04166-B_026448-027146 more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day
sw04166-B_027146-027997 and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on
sw04166-B_028117-028534 uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida
sw04166-B_028534-029005 uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and
sw04166-B_029005-029435 it's it's a bit of a shock to the system {weatherwise} if nothing else
sw04166-B_029694-029961 well there was stuff like that in Florida but
sw04167-A_000000-000050 [noise] well
sw04167-A_000050-000985 it's uh i'll start off here uh i don't know i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from CNN um
sw04167-A_000985-001980 i like CNN because it uh you know repeats it well Headline News repeats every half hour and so it it makes it really convenient because_1 i keep a rather hectic schedule
sw04167-A_001980-002567 and uh but the newspaper pr[ovides]- provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from
sw04167-A_003566-003727 [laughter]
sw04167-A_004511-004649 right
sw04167-A_005373-005510 um-hum
sw04167-A_005947-006054 right
sw04167-A_006160-007445 yeah i know the my only major objection is that uh i don't think American media spends enough uh attention on on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada uh
sw04167-A_008353-008593 um-hum yeah
sw04167-A_009707-010480 right yeah i mean you know Canada's going through a lot of problems now with with Quebec and and everything and uh
sw04167-A_010480-011363 it's amazing that you know i- i listen to DC area and the Washington Post you know i mean the most they'll give it is maybe the back of the A section
sw04167-A_011363-011585 um you know
sw04167-A_011892-012091 [laughter]
sw04167-A_013628-013793 um-hum
sw04167-A_014559-014751 yeah definitely
sw04167-A_014860-014984 yeah
sw04167-A_016086-016217 um-hum
sw04167-A_017274-017695 [laughter]
sw04167-A_017695-017840 right
sw04167-A_018640-019296 right exactly yeah i uh spent this past summer up in Canada uh well part of it touring
sw04167-A_019296-020610 and uh you know i- i was amazed because_1 i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on there's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a a Canada you know in the next five years
sw04167-A_020610-021180 you know because_1 of the problems with Quebec and n[ever]- i had never heard any of that before
sw04167-A_021491-021645 um-hum
sw04167-A_023760-023945 right right
sw04167-A_026281-026425 oh yeah
sw04167-A_027136-027264 um-hum
sw04167-A_029438-029914 yeah um i've i guess i've never seen the TV show i used to get the uh
sw04167-B_000000-000155 [noise]
sw04167-B_001497-001655 right yeah
sw04167-B_002366-002456 yeah
sw04167-B_002456-003093 i- i think i'd agree o[f]- o[f]- of a similar method of getting the news with me too it's uh
sw04167-B_003093-003933 uh CNN has been a welcome addition to [laughter] the T V scene here in the last uh number of years uh
sw04167-B_003933-004580 pr[ior]- prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts
sw04167-B_004580-005428 uh just usually pretty local in in nature and and i like uh CNN because you get some world world events too
sw04167-B_005428-005993 uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth
sw04167-B_007323-008437 that that's true you know you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other wor[ld]- news events going on in either of those countries
sw04167-B_008437-009732 uh whereas if you pick up a a European paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries Soviet Union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them
sw04167-B_011300-011455 yeah
sw04167-B_011455-012291 w[ell]- i'm i'm currently living in Dallas and it it wo[n't]- it won't even give it the back [laughter-section] you just never see you just never see anything about it uh
sw04167-B_012291-013183 which is a shame because_1 you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the US on the other hand and if you go up to uh
sw04167-B_013183-013887 Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news events in the US and
sw04167-B_013887-014616 and we're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in Canada or Mexico
sw04167-B_014616-014908 you just you just don't know what's going on
sw04167-B_014908-015637 i'd i every once in a while i have to travel overseas and then lately i've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh
sw04167-B_015637-016815 around and picking up the BBC and it's sort of like uh a CNN too you you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events uh
sw04167-B_016815-017534 i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area and that's the only way you can [laughter-tell] what's going on at all [laughter]
sw04167-B_017534-017884 there's not [laughter-much] in the way of television in some of those places
sw04167-B_017884-018730 um but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries i hadn't really thought about it but i guess you don't think about it because_1 you don't hear it [laughter]
sw04167-B_020563-020676 yeah
sw04167-B_020917-021078 yeah
sw04167-B_021078-021780 yeah you know there was a a what is it called is it Meech Lake Accord or or yeah that's just something uh
sw04167-B_021780-022731 i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and
sw04167-B_022731-023827 you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and ca[me]- came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers
sw04167-B_023827-024020 and just didn't see a thing about it
sw04167-B_024131-025094 so it's uh we've got a long ways to go i guess it's improved and like i say with CNN and and uh the cable news even even there's a uh
sw04167-B_025094-025582 it's sor[t]- it's semireligious in some respects but what is it it's uh
sw04167-B_025582-026362 i mean its news is not not that way uh oh i'm trying to think of the channel the Chr[istian]- the Christian Science Monitor
sw04167-B_026362-027240 uh i[t]- it surprised me i've caught it a few times and they they do some pretty good news uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts uh
sw04167-B_027240-028021 uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising you'd think it would carry mostly religious but it it doesn't seem to so i'll flip through and
sw04167-B_028021-028647 [noise] listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than CNN might be covering
sw04167-B_028647-029474 uh some more in[terest]- interest type topics in in other countries but it's kind of world world uh network too
sw04168-A_000000-000111 [noise] what what were you saying
sw04168-A_000235-000375 oh okay
sw04168-A_000522-001766 um well i haven't really been up to date on a lot music i have been in school and i haven't really gone out and [noise] bought any or listened to much on the on the radio except for classical and
sw04168-A_001766-001998 uh yes
sw04168-A_002308-002451 um-hum
sw04168-A_002561-002691 [noise] okay
sw04168-A_002982-003394 [noise] well i like most of them_1 except for country
sw04168-A_003394-003996 music no i think i- i might like dancing to it but i don't like listening to it
sw04168-A_004291-004403 whi[ch]-
sw04168-A_004575-004700 oh

sw04168-A_006160-006295 [laughter]
sw04168-A_006295-006503 that's the kind you like you mean
sw04168-A_006607-007384 oh oh okay well i guess i- i like the blues a lot and i guess you could say it's similar as far as
sw04168-A_007384-007647 the kind of [vocalized-noise] the way they do it
sw04168-A_007806-008466 yeah me too too so i guess i like everything except heavy metal and uh
sw04168-A_008466-008704 most rap i don't like
sw04168-A_008704-008851 yeah
sw04168-A_009196-009366 [noise] oh okay

sw04169-A_014054-014206 [laughter]
sw04169-A_014206-014798 well the the most noticeable thing about our two local papers is that we now have one local paper
sw04169-A_014798-015104 The The Times Herald went out of business
sw04169-A_015104-015412 it was always the weak sister of the two
sw04169-A_015412-015816 uh and the Morning News uh
sw04169-A_015919-016797 managed somehow to acquire nearly all the comics and features that the Times Herald had been carrying
sw04169-A_016797-017765 so i mean they just they just plundered [laughter] the poor Times Herald i mean it was financial you can blame the syndicates for going where they're you know they got bigger bucks or whatever
sw04169-A_018020-018175 um-hum
sw04169-A_020166-020273 um-hum
sw04169-A_020478-020570 [laughter]

sw04169-A_026630-026747 yeah
sw04169-A_027132-027710 that one of the most famous headlines and i think this was on the editorial page and i don't remember it exactly
sw04169-A_027710-028545 of the Dallas Morning News was was some story about how well people can read and the fact that they can't and the headline was something like Let's Ban Literacy
sw04169-A_028545-028893 and wait a minute that sounds fine at [laughter-first]
sw04169-A_028893-029204 [laughter] they want to ban illiteracy i think [laughter-think]
sw04169-A_029204-029613 [noise]

sw04169-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04169-B_000474-001205 well actually no uh it's it's multifaceted for me since i'm married to a news junkie
sw04169-B_001205-002428 uh yeah we we get the you know about three papers a day plus there's four different newscasts that we watch and of course if there's nothing else um
sw04169-B_002428-003893 worth doing or watching on television we'll watch either headline news or CNN itself and uh plus i'm a member of a an electronic community and i get a lot of news that way so uh
sw04169-B_003893-004244 it's really pretty hard to not be [laughter-informed]
sw04169-B_004244-004427 how about yourself
sw04169-B_005415-005535 uh-huh
sw04169-B_006529-006703 yeah
sw04169-B_007592-008009 um-hum and of course everything's changed by that time and
sw04169-B_008304-008481 um-hum um-hum
sw04169-B_009094-009183 uh-huh
sw04169-B_009372-009504 yeah
sw04169-B_009504-009902 they really have some fascinating stuff especially on the weekends uh
sw04169-B_009902-010720 we kind of uh we kind of like CNBC i don't know if you've ever seen it but it's a it's a cable well you don't have cable cable NBC
sw04169-B_010720-011246 and it's sort of like uh National Public Radio on cable television
sw04169-B_011246-011887 so they go into all sorts of neat little off the wall kind of topics that you normally wouldn't get
sw04169-B_011887-013053 in uh in uh [noise] in a conventional news broadcast or even on CNN it's sort of like socketed little special interest kinds of things and it's really fascinating to see you know they're out there covering it
sw04169-B_013053-013959 um one thing i wanted to ask you about was the you're you said you're in Dallas the quality of your local papers do you do you see
sw04169-B_013959-014276 pandering because
sw04169-B_014736-014904 uh no
sw04169-B_015034-015157 [noise]
sw04169-B_015366-015499 okay
sw04169-B_016721-016859 uh-huh
sw04169-B_017678-017972 yeah well see we're a Gannett
sw04169-B_017972-018096 city
sw04169-B_018096-019018 and uh the Democrat and Chronicles and Times Union are our papers and a a few years ago they merged editorial boards
sw04169-B_019018-020208 however they still continue to publish they put out three additions well it's actually DNC puts out two one in the morning And the Times Union puts out two but they're virtually the same paper
sw04169-B_020208-020911 there's an there's an evening edition which comes out at [laughter-noon] [laughter-and] and the late edition which comes out at three
sw04169-B_020911-021731 and just to give you an idea of what i meant by pandering it's like sometimes they their news for the news for the incredible stupid or comatose
sw04169-B_021731-022143 the past two days the headlines have been massive storm hits area
sw04169-B_022143-022289 and it's like
sw04169-B_022512-023457 well you know oh well that explains all the snow you know [laughter] as if someone was worried about it i just you know i i have to wonder uh
sw04169-B_023457-023848 uh ho[w]- how well they're serving us because uh
sw04169-B_023848-024962 y[ou]- y[ou]- they've they've got a lock on it they don't there's not that many there's a few alternative newspapers but they all all the alternative newspapers have this sort of an underground feel to them
sw04169-B_024962-025876 and you you know you really can't trust them they're not i- i think i need conservatism from my news i don't know i'm funny
sw04169-B_025876-026707 yeah just the facts and and i don't want really much of a slant on it at all i just want the news
sw04169-B_026707-027129 you know i don't want uh someone judging the news for me
sw04169-B_029118-029853 i think so Let's Ban Literacy but that's going to put you guys out of business don't you think [laughter]
sw04170-A_000000-000797 [noise] all right uh i think we pay a little bit too much in taxes and we don't always get what we pay for [laughter]
sw04170-A_002452-002658 yeah no
sw04170-A_003391-004136 yeah i- i kind of feel the same way you know you pay all this money into Social Security and then you're not gonna get anything back out of it you know
sw04170-A_004136-004671 because_1 you're paying for everybody that uses it now and it's not gonna be there when you need it
sw04170-A_005123-005292 yep [noise]
sw04170-A_006265-006599 [noise] yeah [noise]

sw04170-A_008381-008543 yeah
sw04170-A_008807-009726 yeah well well [noise] well well i think some of the taxes that pay you know you're paying more for the people to
sw04170-A_009726-010565 to disburse the money out than you are for uh the money to be spent you know like on education and stuff
sw04170-A_011550-011698 yeah
sw04170-A_011698-011931 so i- i feel like
sw04170-A_011931-012664 some of like i said some most of the taxes that we pay are not being used for what they're supposed to be used for
sw04170-A_012664-012993 [noise]
sw04170-A_013713-014349 [noise]
sw04170-A_014349-014536 yeah
sw04170-A_014977-015812 uh [noise] yeah and and they like they use taxes to to make grants to people that
sw04170-A_015812-016675 you know they wanna find out how come butterflies do fly and all other kinds and i think that's kind of stupid
sw04170-A_017483-017639 um-hum
sw04170-A_017806-017960 yeah
sw04170-A_019092-019265 yeah and

sw04170-A_021549-021937 i can understand that because_1 [laughter]
sw04170-A_021937-022185 and uh it's
sw04170-A_022185-023577 it you know like you said it makes you upset and it makes me upset too when i hear stuff like that and i just heard on the news tonight where they all them people in Congress overdrafted themselves and they
sw04170-A_023577-024118 you know finally gonna come out with everybody's name now saying who done it
sw04170-A_024118-024289 [noise]
sw04170-A_024289-024429 so

sw04170-A_028260-028432 oh yeah
sw04170-A_028432-029165 uh that and you know like a lot of our tax money goes to helping other countries and stuff and
sw04170-A_029165-029776 i think we ought to use a lot of that money here in the states before we send it to someplace else
sw04170-B_000000-000110 [noise]
sw04170-B_000724-001269 i agree i'm particularly worried about Social Security since i'm at the
sw04170-B_001269-001789 end of the baby boomer generation and there's not gonna be any money left when i get through
sw04170-B_001789-003001 so i kind of feel like i'm supporting a lot of people and that it's just gonna go into a hole [laughter] i don't think that i'm gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from
sw04170-B_003001-003185 [noise] it
sw04170-B_003185-003415 other than that yeah

sw04170-B_005428-005630 we'll be supporting
sw04170-B_005630-006645 we're they're we're a lot of people right now supporting a few people and then when the time comes and it's a few people supporting a lot of people it's not gonna even out very fairly
sw04170-B_006645-007435 that way i don't have to i don't worry about the other i don't have state taxes really because_1 i'm from Texas so
sw04170-B_007435-008414 i'm happy with that [laughter] i'm worried about it though because_1 every year they sit there and try to put more taxes in you know
sw04170-B_008414-008995 and they're trying to get property tax in our county [laughter] but
sw04170-B_010288-010478 [noise] yeah
sw04170-B_010478-011036 there's so much administration and nothing [noise] when it when it comes right down to it
sw04170-B_011036-011647 the overhead is it g[et]- everything gets eaten up in overhead and doesn't actually [noise] d[o]- do much
sw04170-B_012611-013592 yeah i was thinking the other day you know it was like no taxation without representation and so long ago and now we're just eaten alive by
sw04170-B_013592-014419 all this government that can't pay for itself and goes into debt more and more and more and more and we don't have much say about it
sw04170-B_014419-014983 and the government doesn't seem to do a [noise] be doing a whole lot of things i like either
sw04170-B_014983-015133 they're going
sw04170-B_016603-017613 [noise] yeah and then this National Endowment for the Arts thing where they they put pornography up in the in the name of art you know
sw04170-B_017613-017881 and make me pay for it [laughter]
sw04170-B_017881-019139 my you know i- i don't exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then expect me to support them on it
sw04170-B_019139-020171 first you get to the point where it's like you feel like protesting by not paying just to make [noise] them understand that they can't do this just because_1 you know it's our money they're using
sw04170-B_020171-020651 for it they can't just think well it's ours now we got it we can do what we want with it
sw04170-B_020651-021469 it says that i'm standing it it says i approve if i sit there and pay it and i get kind of upset about that
sw04170-B_024116-024314 well that's good
sw04170-B_024314-024648 [noise] yeah you start to feel real powerless
sw04170-B_024648-025595 but on the other hand at least we're [noise] we're powerless in a lot of ways but then there's so many other countries that i'm glad i'm not in
sw04170-B_025595-027005 [noise] you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um Liberia or [laughter] uh Czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like
sw04170-B_027005-027595 i'd rather try to work from inside the system to change something than to throw away what we've got now
sw04170-B_027595-028114 it would be pretty frightening the other way around it's kind of scary now seeing the way
sw04170-B_028114-028345 they're going over there
sw04171-A_000000-000043 [noise]
sw04171-A_000043-000400 so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm
sw04171-A_000928-001058 um-hum
sw04171-A_001609-001735 yeah
sw04171-A_001945-002071 um-hum
sw04171-A_002203-002642 uh i work for a fairly large company it's got eight thousand people
sw04171-A_002642-003023 and uh we do have health insurance and
sw04171-A_003023-003552 we don't have 4O[1K]- -[40]1K plan stuff like that but we do have like
sw04171-A_003552-004540 retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then [noise] the rest is whatever you want to put in if you want to put more than that or something like that
sw04171-A_004642-004846 [noise] that's not bad
sw04171-A_005097-005822 God i don't know [laughter] it's probably a long time [laughter] i'm sure it's not till like twenty five years thirty years
sw04171-A_005822-005944 [vocalized-noise]
sw04171-A_006407-006551 yeah
sw04171-A_006551-007128 huh well i guess what we have is like a f[lex]- what they call a flex benefits plan where you
sw04171-A_007128-008105 you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh [noise]
sw04171-A_008105-008496 guess you can put also put money hold money back and then
sw04171-A_008496-009056 either use it or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or you can just have that money
sw04171-A_009056-009284 you know put in your paycheck
sw04171-A_011494-012409 yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh
sw04171-A_012409-013196 you know you uh think you call it plan D [laughter] deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars
sw04171-A_013196-014282 but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're f[airly]- relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you're gonna use that mu[ch]- amount of money you know
sw04171-A_014282-015508 so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss what[ever]- whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual [laughter]
sw04171-A_016384-016504 um
sw04171-A_017409-017811 really you mean not even y[our]- [dour/your] your car insurance

sw04171-A_022510-022740 yeah it's uh
sw04171-A_023177-023511 [noise] uh with the telecommunications
sw04171-A_023511-024426 type of company supposedly you use[d]- it used to be much more stable it's a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security and crap
sw04171-A_024426-024594 but now they don't
sw04171-A_024719-025065 yeah it's the Bell Corps which is uh
sw04171-A_025065-025900 yeah so i don't know it's it's uh no longer [laughter] so that's what i think it's still based on the old model of
sw04171-A_025900-026180 [noise] and and now they don't uh
sw04171-A_026180-026308 yeah
sw04171-A_026425-026861 yeah but the th[e]- n[o]- no longer [laughter] i don't think so
sw04171-A_026861-027332 uh hearing a lo[t]- there's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit
sw04171-A_027332-027775 that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security
sw04171-A_028101-029250 ah i don't know we don't we haven't been doing layoffs we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i don't know what they do for those people

sw04171-B_011007-011548 that's pretty good you know it's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something
sw04171-B_015450-016116 [noise] yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i- i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh
sw04171-B_016116-017035 one of my kids was in a car accident and and i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of

sw04172-B_007163-007921 think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise
sw04172-B_007921-008767 but um i've been in a job lately where i've been working some really long hours and some nights and weekends and
sw04172-B_008767-009880 it makes you you lose every bit of [vocalized-noise] muscle tone you ever thought about having and then to try to work your way back from that is [laughter] is why i can't really get

sw04173-A_018537-019649 they just adjusted them but they really weren't [laughter-out] [laughter-of] adjustment he they looked at it and he goes it looks like a brand new motor it's because i keep the oil changed and i says well i- i wanted brakes changed and he said
sw04173-A_019754-019919 he looked at them_1
sw04173-A_019919-020690 and he says in the back you have three fourths of your pads and in the front they're three fourths you don't need them_1
sw04173-A_020690-021549 and i so i've been driving all these miles and i didn't need them_1 but i i changed the front i had the brakes done in the front anyway just because_1 i wanted the front wheels you know packed
sw04173-A_021549-022264 the the bearings packed and things and it worked out so i mean i i'm just amazed at the performance and i
sw04173-A_022366-023616 the Japanese cars it just seems that as far as the well i just going interject real quick as a my next purchase i want something with a little more safety features i want the air bags and the antilock brakes that's that's something that i want
sw04173-A_023616-023968 but um i was going to inter[ject]- say is that
sw04173-A_023968-024903 [noise] when General Motors they sell their car and there's too much of a i- i believe there's just too much of a profit margin
sw04173-A_024903-025082 and you they're
sw04173-A_025082-026002 you're not getting the car you're you're you're paying for you might say markup where the Japanese cars you you're paying but you you you're getting that performance
sw04173-A_026002-026842 and so that's i- i said i said i'm i'm very very satisfied with my car in fact i it's a you know it's a little little
sw04173-A_026842-028173 Nissan pickup truck it's five speed i just don't it's i'm i'm not really that tall and it you know it sits me comfortable i have good visibility i mean it just it just a blast it handles like a little sports car just really satisfied with it
sw04173-A_029496-029630 uh-huh
sw04173-B_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04173-B_000580-001340 well [noise] uh the the one we bought most recently and and i think that's a good guard because uh
sw04173-B_001340-002449 we uh we had r[equirements]- our requirements change we we now have two kids and so we need a little bit more room um the the one that we bought in in eighty eight
sw04173-B_002449-003166 uh was a response to the the first child being born and and for that we wanted something really dependable
sw04173-B_003166-003886 something with an excellent repair record uh something that we were not going have it in the shop a lot
sw04173-B_003886-004999 and of all the things that of all the ones that we looked at uh we looked in Consumer Reports and and asked around friends and and looked at our own experiences we went with a a Toyota
sw04173-B_004999-005883 uh we got a Toyota Corolla one of the the wagon kind so it's not as big as the the nineteen fifties uh suburban tank
sw04173-B_005883-006941 but it's it's spacious enough for for now w[e]- now we have two kids uh we've got to put two you know [vocalized-noise] you got enough room for two car seats and and that sort of thing um
sw04173-B_006941-007503 and the repair record has been really terrific um it's been very very nice
sw04173-B_007503-008309 so i think that um based on our own experience and how satisfied and and we know what sort of driving um
sw04173-B_008309-008807 requirements we have we we probably would go with that again it the repair record is
sw04173-B_008807-009854 is for us repair record and the g[as]- and the gas mileage is what drives it for us uh not whether it has a moon roof or uh how many CD players you can stack in it but
sw04173-B_009854-010247 but the the repair record is is the thing for us
sw04173-B_011584-011718 um-hum
sw04173-B_012738-012888 wow
sw04173-B_014031-014171 hm

sw04173-B_015450-015643 that's good yeah
sw04173-B_016990-017112 yeah
sw04173-B_023296-023497 oh yeah yeah
sw04173-B_028004-028508 i- i know it [noise] it it almost seems a shame that [noise]
sw04173-B_028508-029631 of the [noise] the approach perhaps that that uh Detroit takes is that if we're going to make an economy car by God you're going to know it's an economy car
sw04173-B_029631-029840 whereas i get the feel[ing]-

sw04174-A_005382-006155 the one the one thing that i you know i'd advise any parent um you know or any or any person looking for a college um is that
sw04174-A_006155-006276 [noise]
sw04174-A_006276-007360 i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there
sw04174-A_007360-008002 because you know they're just um in my experience i've talked to people at other colleges um that you know
sw04174-A_008002-008697 the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat[alogs]- catalogs isn't always [laughter] the whole story

sw04174-A_014196-015204 [noise] yeah i- i go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not
sw04174-A_015204-016128 the the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there and there doesn't tend to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have

sw04174-A_024148-025503 yeah uh i don't really know of anyone that's like look[ing]- that's looking for colleges now you know because with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters [noise] then only the advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech [laughter] uh
sw04174-A_025503-025705 but uh
sw04174-A_025705-026545 no act[ually]- actually i'm i'm i'm i'm more interested in in in choosing the right j[ob]- job when you graduate [laughter] type information

sw04174-B_000000-000094 [noise]
sw04174-B_000094-001166 okay well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college she's actually at Bible College for this current year
sw04174-B_001166-001347 and uh
sw04174-B_001494-002219 i guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of
sw04174-B_002219-002351 what
sw04174-B_002351-002931 the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh
sw04174-B_002931-003468 uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program
sw04174-B_003468-004692 and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or you know it does it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs
sw04174-B_004692-005039 uh what do you feel about some of the things that need to
sw04174-B_008677-010002 no y[ou]- the the college uh their the catalogs are sales material it doesn't matter whether [noise] you know they're they're selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a
sw04174-B_010002-010316 parent and the student can get there and see
sw04174-B_010316-010932 the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school
sw04174-B_010932-011347 uh i guess there's a difference in here th[e]- the
sw04174-B_011347-012291 [noise] at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community
sw04174-B_012291-012401 uh
sw04174-B_012401-013051 you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the
sw04174-B_013051-014140 smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
sw04174-B_014597-014717 um-hum
sw04174-B_016201-017203 yeah uh i guess we're here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh
sw04174-B_017203-017552 on a small quantity of gas our engineering students
sw04174-B_017552-018386 uh in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of
sw04174-B_018497-019884 achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you an idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a
sw04174-B_019884-020112 a spirit of
sw04174-B_020112-020770 somewhat unkind but producing graduates um you know as sort of
sw04174-B_020770-021595 some development and some training uh like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
sw04174-B_021595-022080 and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even
sw04174-B_022080-022477 as to how you know what the attitude
sw04174-B_022477-022683 towards achievement is
sw04174-B_022785-022907 uh
sw04174-B_023012-023187 do you uh
sw04174-B_023187-023545 have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh
sw04174-B_023545-024170 feed information to i suppose if you're actually a[t]- at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that
sw04174-B_025242-025395 [laughter]
sw04174-B_026349-026485 right
sw04174-B_026485-027123 well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well
sw04174-B_027123-027754 uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on
sw04174-B_027754-028552 the pro[grams]- pro[grams]- programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
sw04174-B_028552-029179 and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market [noise] jeez the best
sw04174-B_029179-029683 right best training in the world is not going to f[eed]- put food on your table
sw04174-B_029683-029853 and uh
sw04175-A_000000-000051 [noise] [laughter]
sw04175-A_000051-000207 i don't believe that we're
sw04175-A_000407-001379 [noise] the recycling program here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean Kroger does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers
sw04175-A_002853-003023 yeah
sw04175-A_003023-004135 the one in Florida is so cool because_1 they pick up everything they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff

sw04175-A_007570-007745 [laughter]
sw04175-A_007745-007933 [noise] i just don't know
sw04175-A_007933-008866 i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because_1 mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff
sw04175-A_009913-010100 i know it i know
sw04175-A_010352-010501 oh yeah

sw04175-A_011046-011177 um-hum
sw04175-A_011449-011812 well i mean it's really [vocalized-noise] you ought to because the
sw04175-A_011812-012139 the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything
sw04175-A_012139-012366 and since we go there all the time i mean
sw04175-A_012366-012488 probably
sw04175-A_012488-012685 be at all
sw04175-A_012685-012853 [laughter]
sw04175-A_012853-013109 oh by the way my name is Julie

sw04175-A_013607-013765 [laughter]
sw04175-A_014438-014746 i just think that everybody ought to do it
sw04175-A_015096-015480 the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs
sw04175-A_015480-015645 [noise] yeah
sw04175-A_015865-016129 [noise] oh yeah they have uh [noise]
sw04175-A_016129-016307 [noise] uh
sw04175-A_016307-017148 what i what i used to uh now that i don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time
sw04175-A_017148-017601 and then go and hand them_1 to them_1 the next time and use them_1 over and over
sw04175-A_017601-018186 an[d]- but also most places i think like Big Star does and i'm not sure if Kroger does or not but
sw04175-A_018343-018875 yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in
sw04175-A_018875-019058 can bring them_1 in
sw04175-A_019238-019456 i know it i know it

sw04175-A_021710-021900 filled with paper
sw04175-A_021900-022021 huh
sw04175-A_022123-022340 well it is it is though
sw04175-A_022443-022627 it is because_1 they
sw04175-A_023011-023132 well
sw04175-A_023132-023496 they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper you know
sw04175-A_023496-024231 takes something like [noise] twenty times as long to decompose you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper an it will still be there in a couple of weeks
sw04175-A_024231-024402 yeah it'll be whole
sw04175-A_024402-024603 you'll be able to read off of it
sw04175-A_024704-024855 um hum

sw04175-A_025302-025383 [vocalized-noise]
sw04175-A_025565-025911 well white paper's bad too they they treat it too
sw04175-A_026291-026550 i'm sure that's fine i'm sure
sw04175-A_026550-026855 maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again
sw04175-A_026970-027122 maybe
sw04175-A_027122-027254 yeah
sw04175-A_027528-027662 you think
sw04175-A_027801-028052 i don't know well i mean
sw04175-A_028193-028513 i think we've kind of you know i mean everybody -[every]body
sw04175-A_028513-028766 [laughter] if everybody had a computer
sw04175-A_028867-029177 we would no longer need paper at all
sw04175-A_029500-029784 [laughter]
sw04175-A_029784-029856 i would love that
sw04175-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04175-B_000048-000447 so what do you think about uh the recycling programs in Atlanta Julie
sw04175-B_001358-001719 i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get [noise]
sw04175-B_001719-002534 i- i really don't know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know
sw04175-B_002534-002676 thing to you but
sw04175-B_002676-003098 i think there should be some kind of curbside service that's the only way i could really
sw04175-B_004057-004205 uh-huh [noise]
sw04175-B_004205-004458 during the summers like the
sw04175-B_004458-004695 around where i live the uh
sw04175-B_004695-005814 homeless people see[m]- i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and they'll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them_1 up and then they'd come around and we'd give them_1 to them
sw04175-B_005814-006243 but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so
sw04175-B_006243-006857 i don't do that anymore and the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that um outside the uh student center
sw04175-B_006857-007056 they never empty those things
sw04175-B_007056-007244 they just overflow
sw04175-B_007346-007506 so what's a guy to do

sw04176-A_002052-002943 the idea of like you know spending spending like two years in a village in Uganda is you know teaching people how to like you know
sw04176-A_002943-003524 plow a straight furrow is just not my idea [laughter-of] something i want to do with my life [laughter]
sw04176-A_003524-003775 [laughter]
sw04176-A_004493-004627 uh-huh

sw04176-A_005465-006124 i you know i- i thought that joining the Peace Corps was something that everybody did like in the sixties you know in
sw04176-A_006675-006831 uh-huh
sw04176-A_007310-008545 i yeah i- i- i talked to i was talking to somebody uh the other day and they they said i think they went they were in the Peace Corps and they ended up going to like Central America or something and uh
sw04176-A_008545-009129 they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face in like you know seventy five years
sw04176-A_009129-010441 and uh they had to go on the it's like they had t[ypical]- it it's the typical third world story you know they they had to every ev[ery]- once a week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into and
sw04176-A_010441-011289 take drive up into the mountains and stop at each village you know and and have like give lectures on like public health and stuff

sw04176-A_012142-013296 and it's like the children would come up and like touch him because you know they had never seen somebody that light you know a gringo and that it was it was pretty it was really pretty strange
sw04176-A_013296-014429 i it was it would seem to me like if joining the Peace Corps is like you know going to anoth[er]- signing up to go to another planet you know [laughter]
sw04176-A_015175-015669 i would really be afraid of i- i don't know when i- i went to school i- i uh
sw04176-A_015669-016888 i took a course in Parasitology and stuff like that i would really be afraid of like you know of all the diseases and stuff that i could catch and like and man it it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight
sw04176-A_016888-017650 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] oh i don't know
sw04176-A_018252-018440 uh-huh i
sw04176-A_018672-018802 [noise]
sw04176-A_018802-019467 no it it doesn't seem like the kind of job that i i'd really be in[terested]- i'm really interested in either
sw04176-A_019467-019857 oh i'm a i'm an engineer yeah
sw04176-A_019857-020111 uh uh Lockheed

sw04176-A_024031-024730 uh i being in the defense industry is not is not really the thing to to be in right now
sw04176-A_024730-025265 it it's sort of like being in steel like ten years ago [laughter]
sw04176-A_025265-025942 right you you know that uh [vocalized-noise] i was just talking to somebody about this the other day is that uh i
sw04176-A_025942-026913 i haven't seen a a a new hire uh somebody you know just fresh out of college brought into the company in like a year and a half
sw04176-A_026913-027825 and uh what's happening is that you know we're just like kind of getting grayer and grayer and grayer you know the the there's no growth here
sw04176-A_028757-028889 um-hum
sw04176-A_029312-029968 yeah [noise] this the this attrition thing though i that that that's like death itself in my mi[nd]-
sw04176-B_000000-000313 [noise]
sw04176-B_000313-000629 uh f[or]- not for any longer than about ten seconds
sw04176-B_000947-001361 no i have no [laughter] i have no real desire to do that [laughter]
sw04176-B_003065-003211 yeah
sw04176-B_003421-003685 yeah i don't doesn't appeal to me either
sw04176-B_003685-004498 where i work uh there's a guy who actually joined the Peace Corps he worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana
sw04176-B_004498-004706 in Africa [laughter]
sw04176-B_004706-004869 and uh
sw04176-B_004869-005102 well he hasn't come back yet
sw04176-B_005102-005224 [laughter]
sw04176-B_005353-005558 yeah he went just recently
sw04176-B_005988-006763 well there's yeah but there's actually been a resurgence of people getting into it i guess part partly for economic times
sw04176-B_006763-007404 and uh i don't know any other reason but lot of people are been getting back into it i think [laughter]
sw04176-B_008371-008513 um-hum
sw04176-B_009051-009185 uh-huh
sw04176-B_011247-011429 uh-huh
sw04176-B_011429-011679 [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw04176-B_011679-011820 uh-huh
sw04176-B_012877-012993 sure
sw04176-B_014175-014302 yeah
sw04176-B_014302-014802 yeah i don't i'm not sure i mean i guess the motivation is partly you want to help these people but i think
sw04176-B_014802-015260 it's a lot of people join it just to go to another country and kind of for the adventure of it i guess
sw04176-B_015922-016058 um
sw04176-B_016425-016587 oh yeah
sw04176-B_016844-017125 yeah seems a little rough for that
sw04176-B_017321-017476 but uh
sw04176-B_017579-018303 i don't know i kind of you know i don't mind going to Europe you know traveling and seeing the sights but i don't want to have to go to Africa to
sw04176-B_018303-018897 no th[e]- maybe they they'll they'll fly you over there and back for free but doesn't seem worth it
sw04176-B_019354-019570 what type of work do you do now
sw04176-B_019672-019984 okay for who do you work for you work for
sw04176-B_020085-020338 oh really i didn't know they had an office up there
sw04176-B_021189-021399 Sanders avionics
sw04176-B_021399-021863 okay yeah i've heard of Sanders Corporation were they bought out by Lockheed and all of that okay
sw04176-B_022495-023215 right that's that's kind of the work that i do so that's why i've heard of Sanders i work for i work for Georgia Tech
sw04176-B_023215-023383 in research
sw04176-B_024547-024803 right that's right [laughter]
sw04176-B_025111-025360 yeah you're just kind of biding your time
sw04176-B_026487-026609 uh-huh
sw04176-B_026916-027028 yeah
sw04176-B_027521-027649 uh-huh
sw04176-B_027751-028840 yeah it we're essentially the same although some some laboratories are hiring if if they can find new technology uh you know or make an efforts to get into the commercial markets
sw04176-B_028840-029373 so we're kind of getting smaller through attrition but there in some cases we're hiring also
sw04177-A_000000-000020 [noise]
sw04177-A_000020-000533 hi so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
sw04177-A_001543-001837 do you watch a lot of TV to get the news then
sw04177-A_002358-002454 um
sw04177-A_002602-003392 well i read um i get a bunch of different things i get a newspaper every day and i try to a[t]- at least have a few minutes to look through that
sw04177-A_003392-003553 and i look through uh
sw04177-A_003553-004033 i get a Newsweek every week which i- i pretty much read that cover to cover [noise]
sw04177-A_004033-004496 and i as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news i get
sw04177-A_004496-004843 uh don't watch much TV don't have enough time
sw04177-A_004843-005908 and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened and that's about all i ever hear of it
sw04177-A_005908-006003 uh
sw04177-A_006003-006506 but most of my news probably comes from Newsweek and for the longer term i- i read
sw04177-A_006506-006589 um
sw04177-A_006589-007118 like Scientific American and and uh Reader's Digest and some of those other types of magazines
sw04177-A_007118-007932 that come out which they the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material
sw04177-A_007932-008767 yeah it's it's more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth and uh
sw04177-A_008767-009498 it's it's more sig[nificant]- it's more just significant information you know it's the big events not the little events
sw04177-A_009498-010002 not the fact that there was a big auto accident down at the corner of Broad and Main you know
sw04177-A_010103-010614 yes or they're making making time because they have to fill in an hour's worth of news
sw04177-A_010614-011200 um i get kind of bored watching TV actually when i watch the news on TV because
sw04177-A_011200-011749 it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting
sw04177-A_012449-013096 [noise] yeah that that's about what it ends up being listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something [laughter]
sw04177-A_013898-014715 yeah i think they're about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind
sw04177-A_014715-014839 and uh
sw04177-A_014839-015081 uh what what kind of um
sw04177-A_015081-015685 what kind of news normally interests you i mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring
sw04177-A_016801-016927 um-hum
sw04177-A_017149-017406 i think it will um
sw04177-A_017406-017739 they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but
sw04177-A_017739-017880 we've yet to see it
sw04177-A_017880-018208 [vocalized-noise] it's real short term yet though i mean it's only been
sw04177-A_018208-018530 three months or something like that since that happened so
sw04177-A_018530-018958 but they like to tell us that it's going to be important [laughter]
sw04177-A_018958-019182 i think it is too
sw04177-A_020133-020500 yeah i- i think that's a possibility um
sw04177-A_020500-021008 it we might also be helped though because it it'll be easier to do business over there too
sw04177-A_021008-021341 for the companies that already have a presence over there
sw04177-A_021341-021697 and uh i know of at least one company that
sw04177-A_021697-022348 specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety two so that they would have it when it came time
sw04177-A_022348-023056 yep because once you're in there then you can easily expand but getting in after nineteen ninety two is more difficult
sw04177-A_023456-023615 [noise] yes
sw04177-A_023615-024319 and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know
sw04177-A_024319-024608 like England doesn't want to do one thing and
sw04177-A_024608-025299 and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
sw04177-A_025299-025812 and some of it i mean is i'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified
sw04177-A_026249-026381 um-hum
sw04177-A_026488-026774 before they open up their borders to everyone
sw04177-A_026774-027385 [noise] um what is the um do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that
sw04177-A_027809-028000 [laughter]
sw04177-A_028000-028198 against your will
sw04177-A_028469-028648 [laughter]
sw04177-A_028648-028947 yeah at least you guys have a remote control
sw04177-A_029056-029524 it's sometimes better to not have one of those course you can always mislocate it
sw04177-A_029524-029863 or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it and
sw04177-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04177-B_000540-001551 uh actually no because_1 because_1 i'm in school i- i kind of miss out on most of the current events i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it
sw04177-B_001787-002409 uh i- i don't watch a lot of it but that's the on[ly]- basically that's my only major source of information
sw04177-B_002409-002600 what about what about you
sw04177-B_005469-005599 yeah
sw04177-B_007047-007174 uh
sw04177-B_007838-008005 and it's more in depth
sw04177-B_009415-009548 yeah
sw04177-B_009918-010163 i know it when they're just trying to fill in
sw04177-B_010520-010650 yeah
sw04177-B_011055-011281 i know i do i do too
sw04177-B_011732-011978 yeah you may find one little
sw04177-B_011978-012480 uh news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it
sw04177-B_013048-013958 [noise] yeah actually y[ou]- you mention Newsweek i- i- i do like uh US News and World Report i don't get to read it as much as i like but that's i think that's a good magazine
sw04177-B_014666-014789 yeah
sw04177-B_015474-015991 oh well right now i'm trying to keep abreast of uh what's going on in Europe
sw04177-B_015991-016856 you know with all the uh USSR's satellites breaking off and trying to become independent and then you know European community coming together
sw04177-B_016856-017164 that's gonna affect our uh economy quite a bit
sw04177-B_017887-017977 [vocalized-noise]
sw04177-B_018323-018479 oh yeah definitely
sw04177-B_018479-018601 yeah
sw04177-B_018800-019061 i'm i'm pretty sure it is because_1 uh
sw04177-B_019061-019384 once once Europe becomes unified
sw04177-B_019384-019791 and uh their economy becomes one big economy
sw04177-B_019791-019945 we're gonna be uh
sw04177-B_019945-020161 kind of hurting [laughter]
sw04177-B_020946-021104 yeah definitely
sw04177-B_022187-022445 oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold
sw04177-B_022997-023103 yeah because_1
sw04177-B_023103-023446 when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist
sw04177-B_023446-023579 so
sw04177-B_023579-023711 yeah
sw04177-B_024253-024390 yeah
sw04177-B_025251-025379 uh-huh
sw04177-B_025740-026505 yeah i- i can understand their viewpoint they're just they're starting off and their economy's a little bit weak so they want to get established before they
sw04177-B_026505-026616 com[pete]-
sw04177-B_026616-026807 yeah totally
sw04177-B_027372-027903 actually i'm not really into sports my roommates are so unfortunately i am forced to watch quite a bit of sports
sw04177-B_027903-028116 [laughter]

sw04178-A_000000-000020 [noise]
sw04178-A_000020-000086 [noise] uh
sw04178-A_000303-000396 [noise] oh did you
sw04178-A_001522-001655 um-hum
sw04178-A_002648-003364 uh-huh well ours is similar to that al[though]- it does not fall on [laughter-anybody] in particular uh
sw04178-A_003364-004280 of course back when my grandparents were alive they always did it and then it seems like our parents kind of let it slide so
sw04178-A_004280-005295 cou[sins]- myself and my cousins have started taking this up [laughter-recently] and we've had one oh a few years ago and what we did was uh
sw04178-A_005295-006371 since we didn't weren't sure of all the addresses and what have [laughter-you] that we started sending out flyers a year beforehand and uh
sw04178-A_006371-007529 yes you know trying to see who knew where who else lived and what have you and also gave them_1 a little questionnaire to fill out as to what would be the most convenient time
sw04178-A_007529-008460 we gave them_1 a couple of choices there uh time and place whether they would like to go back to our quote old hometown or
sw04178-A_008460-008823 someplace in between [laughter] for all of us
sw04178-A_009161-009394 yes uh-huh
sw04178-A_009394-010332 yes just you know anybody that was in the family mostly cousins second cousins and what have you and their families and anybody that
sw04178-A_010332-011386 you know wanted to we wound up going to um since i was i was born in Arkansas and that's what we considered our hometown we wound up going to Biloxi Mississippi
sw04178-A_011386-012008 and we uh of course called ahead and got reservations for everyone
sw04178-A_012008-012178 and uh
sw04178-A_012178-012881 it turned out real well because the children then had a swimming pool and what have you and it gave us a chance
sw04178-A_012881-013482 to get reacquainted without all the burden falling on somebody else
sw04178-A_014351-014472 uh-huh
sw04178-A_015568-015692 uh-huh
sw04178-A_016263-016418 yes it i
sw04178-A_016418-016533 [noise]
sw04178-A_018053-018124 um-hum
sw04178-A_018514-018630 uh-huh
sw04178-A_019009-019185 uh-huh well that could be
sw04178-A_019513-019617 uh-huh
sw04178-A_020030-020171 um-hum
sw04178-A_020587-021640 well we have a pretty small family anyway so uh we're [laughter-only] sixty two you know with our cousins and so forth and like my children
sw04178-A_021640-021843 have no cousins
sw04178-A_021843-022082 [laughter] no first cousins
sw04178-A_022082-022590 so i[t]- it's like i say our family's dwindling [laughter-here]
sw04178-A_022788-023165 [vocalized-noise]
sw04178-A_023704-023938 oh i bet [laughter]
sw04178-A_023938-024076 [laughter]
sw04178-A_024447-024542 um-hum
sw04178-A_025361-025508 right uh-huh
sw04178-A_025635-025761 um-hum
sw04178-A_026955-027078 um-hum
sw04178-A_027191-027681 yeah well that's that's good that's well like i say it uh
sw04178-A_027793-028535 we [noise] have been talking about again this well another cousin and i that seem to [laughter-want] to do this all the [laughter-time] that um
sw04178-A_028535-029498 we've been talking about getting together for another one because_1 it has been quite a few years now and we'll probably go the same route that we did before because we had a good response
sw04178-A_029498-029840 well i don't know we're going give them_1 another choice [laughter]
sw04178-B_000000-000017 [noise]
sw04178-B_000017-000458 well we just had a uh family reunion last summer as it turns out
sw04178-B_000458-001605 and uh the way it usually works is my father's father all of his children which is all my aunts and uncles uh have traditionally had this rotating schedule sort of thing
sw04178-B_001605-002689 and uh would go to one of the brothers and sisters or my aunts and uncles or my father and they'd plan it and go somewhere exotic and invite all the cousins an[d]- so that's kind of the framework that we've been working under
sw04178-B_003708-003878 um-hum
sw04178-B_006176-006427 so a pretty big adventure there
sw04178-B_008709-009480 so so how many generations were you trying to round up was this just like from your grandparents on down or we you trying to get second and third cousins an[d]-
sw04178-B_009879-009990 um-hum
sw04178-B_011040-011163 um-hum
sw04178-B_013455-014585 that sounds like a good way to do it because what happens with with our system is you know the the family who's turns it comes and and they come every oh let's see every two years every three years something like that
sw04178-B_014585-015821 um [laughter] generally finds themselves really doing a lot of organization you know they wherever they decide to go they're responsible for deciding what games that are going to be played and what food the and who's going to bring what an[d]-
sw04178-B_015821-016337 they don't bring everything but just making the assignments and everything turns out to be kind of a chore
sw04178-B_016337-017144 and uh was my family's shot just this last summer and uh my sister ended up doing most of the work
sw04178-B_017144-017475 and uh we've decided
sw04178-B_017475-018825 all the all the my brothers and sisters are pretty much grown up now we're all married we all have our own kids and it's kind of looking like this business of getting all the other cousins my cousins together is just
sw04178-B_018825-019059 not really working out so well
sw04178-B_019059-020312 because my children are are now have cousins of their own that they'd rather get with and and so i think what's going to happen in the future is it will be from my father on down and and all of his descendants and and tho[se]- those cousins so
sw04178-B_020312-020616 we're we're kind of dissipating as we get bigger and bigger here
sw04178-B_021199-021324 yeah
sw04178-B_021898-022043 well that's kind of sad
sw04178-B_022161-022213 that's
sw04178-B_022471-022971 yeah well my dad's one of about eight children and i'm one of nine
sw04178-B_022971-023745 and uh all of my aunts and uncles all have lots of kids so we had lots of cousins by the time you get all of them and their kids together it's
sw04178-B_023745-023927 it's a big undertaking
sw04178-B_023927-024475 you know we have to find a a b[ig]- substantially large place just to get everything set up
sw04178-B_024475-024978 and uh what we did this last summer is my sister used to work for uh [noise]
sw04178-B_024978-025717 uh kind of uh a canyon retreat for uh uh disabled children
sw04178-B_025717-026843 and uh since she was an employee she knew what the schedule was and knew when it'd be free signed up and and reserved and paid for the place so so we could all show up and it was nice you know there're several cabins there
sw04178-B_026843-027234 swimming pool and horses and all that and it and we filled the place up
sw04178-B_029248-029400 back
sw04178-B_029400-029571 back to Mississippi
sw04178-B_029571-029735 [noise]
sw04179-A_000000-000261 [noise] a uh Golden Retriever
sw04179-A_000261-000416 yeah
sw04179-A_000416-000625 is it really
sw04179-A_000625-001127 we've had him for let's see he just had his fourth birthday
sw04179-A_001127-001421 yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
sw04179-A_001421-001651 and uh
sw04179-A_001651-001942 he's pretty okay we like him
sw04179-A_001942-002602 he does that's the one thing we don't like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
sw04179-A_002602-002889 he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that
sw04179-A_002889-003670 he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and he's up to ninety four now
sw04179-A_003670-004423 but he's not a real he's not a real tall uh dog for a Golden Retriever he's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
sw04179-A_004670-005892 he is it's uh just me and my wife and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i gue[ss]- we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten
sw04179-A_005892-006715 because_1 i you can get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids [laughter] how about you
sw04179-A_006933-007064 uh
sw04179-A_007343-007534 uh-huh
sw04179-A_007534-007710 yeah
sw04179-A_008449-008933 that's probably a good idea they're good though uh have you ever had a Retriever before
sw04179-A_009118-010059 because_1 i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play
sw04179-A_010059-010503 and especially_1 with kids they love to play with kids in
sw04179-A_010630-010947 no he's pretty much an inside dog
sw04179-A_010947-012109 he stays in we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside he's he's really a wimp
sw04179-A_012109-013125 and when it comes to being alone uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside he'll he'll just bark and bark and bark
sw04179-A_013522-014492 no he's uh taken to the training pretty well and uh he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries
sw04179-A_014492-015476 and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and uh she she is good friends with my dog
sw04179-A_015476-015715 and so he often gets
sw04179-A_015715-016759 to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but he's pretty goo[d]- he stays out of the street and uh if i catch him i call him and he comes back
sw04179-A_016759-017308 so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and things
sw04179-A_017470-017722 no we never did
sw04179-A_017722-018446 i i trained him on my own and uh this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
sw04179-A_018446-019380 we've had kid[s]- or we've had dogs when i was a kid but this this is the first one that i uh took in so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time
sw04179-A_019380-020186 but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well i never really had to hit him or anything just you know firm tone of voice
sw04179-A_020186-021284 and those sorts of things i i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and and those horrible collars that they put on them_1 with invinci[ble]- invisible fencing least i think i[t]-
sw04179-A_021284-021549 invisible fencing have you heard of that
sw04179-A_021549-022991 it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
sw04179-A_022991-023568 and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them_1 yeah [laughter-yeah]
sw04179-A_023679-024829 yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt
sw04179-A_024829-025871 yeah so i i don't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques i don't think they're always necessary if you put enough patience into uh
sw04179-A_025871-026080 um-hum
sw04179-A_026080-026531 it's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
sw04179-A_027120-027454 somebody just told me that because of the leukemia
sw04179-A_028321-028904 wow quite a difference what uh what kind of climate do you have
sw04179-A_029288-029394 [vocalized-noise]

sw04179-B_006488-007693 um-hum well we have a cat who's also about four years old and [noise] he's our spoiled child right now too [laughter] and he also sheds a lot
sw04179-B_007693-008512 but we uh we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday but we figure we'll get the kids and then th[e]- the dog [laughter]
sw04179-B_008859-009189 [noise] no but my husband had one when he was growing up

sw04179-B_014421-014529 hm
sw04179-B_015411-015566 [noise] oh yeah
sw04179-B_016137-016301 [laughter]
sw04179-B_017100-017802 hm did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own and
sw04179-B_018367-018511 uh-huh
sw04179-B_019661-019805 uh-huh
sw04179-B_019963-020127 huh
sw04179-B_020127-020329 amazing

sw04179-B_021395-021637 no what is that
sw04179-B_022399-022589 oh
sw04179-B_023194-023342 huh
sw04179-B_023342-023846 boy i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog [laughter]
sw04179-B_024749-024915 oh really
sw04179-B_025117-025242 hm
sw04179-B_025688-026091 yeah just be consistent and diligent with it an[d]-
sw04179-B_026091-026226 hm
sw04179-B_026369-027203 yeah he's indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months and
sw04179-B_027203-027388 yeah
sw04179-B_027388-028361 [noise] yeah that and also just um getting hit i guess or getting beat up [noise] and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years [laughter]
sw04179-B_028361-028504 so
sw04179-B_028504-028639 yeah
sw04179-B_028838-029863 [noise] well um [noise] it's we just moved recently [laughter] so now we're in the um Dallas area and it's very very nice an[d]-
sw04180-A_000000-000543 [noise] so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or
sw04180-A_000543-000746 about right or
sw04180-A_000972-001113 yeah
sw04180-A_002523-002772 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] it's hard to tell
sw04180-A_003199-003332 uh-huh
sw04180-A_003858-003992 uh-huh
sw04180-A_004586-004723 um-hum
sw04180-A_004905-005312 now is that the debt [vocalized-noise] or is that just the interest on the debt
sw04180-A_005312-006169 yes [vocalized-noise] you know i really don't understand this completely i've always been a little mystified who who are we paying it to
sw04180-A_006169-006359 okay
sw04180-A_007614-008328 okay so it's to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort
sw04180-A_009102-009290 uh-huh
sw04180-A_009290-009612 okay so but these are nongovernmental entities
sw04180-A_009612-009910 okay who are holding bonds and whatever
sw04180-A_010158-010308 okay
sw04180-A_010308-010712 yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean
sw04180-A_010712-011828 what's to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if you're just servicing the debt you're not really making any progress right
sw04180-A_013032-013589 so we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget
sw04180-A_014344-014504 so
sw04180-A_015182-015380 which is only increasing
sw04180-A_016578-016817 right and uh
sw04180-A_016817-017353 then the question i mean do other countries do this or is this a distinctly American phenomenon
sw04180-A_017861-018003 uh-huh
sw04180-A_018646-018774 uh-huh
sw04180-A_018944-019545 well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt
sw04180-A_019545-019979 and they just seemed like it's a good idea why stop [laughter]
sw04180-A_020915-021042 uh-huh
sw04180-A_021511-021671 uh-huh
sw04180-A_021671-021932 so what do you think is the uh
sw04180-A_021932-022248 you know if you were in charge what would you
sw04180-A_022248-022610 what parts would you change to fix this problem
sw04180-A_023127-023549 so at least we wouldn't have that additional uh
sw04180-A_023549-023905 what was it eighteen percent or yeah
sw04180-A_024215-024346 uh-huh
sw04180-A_025465-025598 uh-huh
sw04180-A_026091-026293 [laughter]
sw04180-A_026461-027214 well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it
sw04180-A_027626-027759 uh-huh
sw04180-A_027904-028081 uh-huh
sw04180-A_028081-028255 um-hum
sw04180-A_028884-029348 it is shocking but apparently no one's willing to
sw04180-A_029348-029808 oh i'm not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems
sw04180-B_000000-000110 [noise]
sw04180-B_000556-001136 well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
sw04180-B_001136-001433 to some extent there is definitely
sw04180-B_001433-002725 you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring
sw04180-B_002725-003354 there there seems to be some prob[lem]- you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not
sw04180-B_003354-003937 what i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day
sw04180-B_003937-004874 i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt
sw04180-B_005138-005416 that that is the interest on the debt
sw04180-B_006081-006207 ourselves
sw04180-B_006327-007657 um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations
sw04180-B_008257-009206 well not not just private but there's you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons
sw04180-B_009206-009494 that are holding that but
sw04180-B_009494-009768 yeah nongovernmental
sw04180-B_009768-010244 yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever
sw04180-B_011741-013091 right well it's actually uh you also looking at the same form they had that we are borr[owing]- the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of h[ow]- how of whatever it's spending every year
sw04180-B_013499-014680 yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eight[een]- the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay
sw04180-B_014680-015285 you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt
sw04180-B_015285-016657 yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
sw04180-B_017277-018446 that i don't know i don't know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so
sw04180-B_018446-018965 you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt
sw04180-B_019493-019610 yeah
sw04180-B_019890-020978 yeah i- i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down
sw04180-B_020978-021764 after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was [vocalized-noise] World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down
sw04180-B_022599-023182 well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have to have a year to year balanced budget
sw04180-B_023725-024642 yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a
sw04180-B_024642-025401 tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy
sw04180-B_025401-026576 you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i very quickly get in trouble with creditors
sw04180-B_027228-028226 um yeah well that's you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger
sw04180-B_028226-028627 but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of
sw04180-B_028627-028916 the money we pay in for taxes each year
sw04181-A_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04181-A_000024-000205 i don't think anybody pays too little
sw04181-A_000854-001101 do you get hit up for local taxes there
sw04181-A_002096-002350 oh so y[ou]- y[ou]- you get the whole smorgasbord
sw04181-A_002350-002619 well i- i actually live in New Hampshire
sw04181-A_002619-002872 tax free or die uh-huh
sw04181-A_003195-003496 no actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either
sw04181-A_003496-003934 no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
sw04181-A_003934-004481 the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there
sw04181-A_004481-005168 yep but it well you know we i[t's]- it's only a state taxes no local we've got a five percent sales tax
sw04181-A_005168-005955 but um the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even though i don't live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
sw04181-A_005955-006152 so that's not too bad
sw04181-A_008895-009979 yeah oh i- i- i mean i- i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun [vocalized-noise]
sw04181-A_009979-010394 right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA
sw04181-A_010394-011481 which is taxes where you [vocalized-noise] most people forget about them_1 because you've g[ot]- you know you can't always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA i'm paying forty percent tax
sw04181-A_012203-012741 yeah well i- i mean i think there's some people there y[ou]- there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
sw04181-A_012741-013195 you kn[ow]- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
sw04181-A_013195-013425 than you're gonna get out of private individuals but
sw04181-A_013425-014233 you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or
sw04181-A_014233-014915 you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in
sw04181-A_014915-016041 into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them_1
sw04181-A_016858-017000 you know like we we
sw04181-A_017000-017121 um
sw04181-A_017121-017461 yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals
sw04181-A_017461-018199 and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
sw04181-A_019144-019265 [vocalized-noise]
sw04181-A_021234-021554 well be[tween]- between between him and Reagan yeah
sw04181-A_021554-021751 the great communicator
sw04181-A_022409-022641 oh oh yeah they think
sw04181-A_022641-023064 oh yeah and then they go and say and that Con[gress]- Congress they're the fault for it
sw04181-A_023064-024077 but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know it's like
sw04181-A_024077-024949 you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if those if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
sw04181-A_024949-025400 so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
sw04181-A_025901-026011 yes
sw04181-A_026699-026912 who who aren't contributing right yeah
sw04181-A_027087-027262 and uh in our
sw04181-A_027364-027446 right
sw04181-A_027446-027510 [noise]
sw04181-A_027510-027738 but what's very funny is in our town meeting
sw04181-A_027738-029020 they were vo[ting]- th[is]- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution [noise] for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
sw04181-A_029020-029297 they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this
sw04181-A_029297-029720 course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use
sw04181-A_029821-029863 yeah
sw04181-B_000000-000044 [noise]
sw04181-B_000179-000898 [laughter-no] i would tend to agree very highly i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it
sw04181-B_001016-001403 yeah we sure do here in Indiana we pay uh
sw04181-B_001403-002148 we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it
sw04181-B_002297-002435 that's [laughter-right] we
sw04181-B_002561-002695 uh-huh
sw04181-B_002695-003283 right which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
sw04181-B_003403-003650 there's [laughter-no] [laughter-sales] tax either
sw04181-B_003865-004012 uh-huh
sw04181-B_004144-004264 right
sw04181-B_004395-004561 {Taxachusetts}
sw04181-B_004830-004931 uh-huh
sw04181-B_005090-005228 [noise] right
sw04181-B_005514-005638 right
sw04181-B_005866-006032 uh-huh
sw04181-B_006032-006949 no i uh i really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh
sw04181-B_006949-007479 last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
sw04181-B_007479-008684 and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that
sw04181-B_008684-008941 that i'm just getting overtaxed
sw04181-B_009631-009800 uh-huh
sw04181-B_009800-010083 [laughter-no] that's that's not any fun
sw04181-B_010336-010478 uh-huh
sw04181-B_010478-010660 right
sw04181-B_010948-011047 right
sw04181-B_011390-012275 yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste
sw04181-B_012689-012816 right
sw04181-B_013144-013286 right
sw04181-B_013797-013942 [laughter-right]
sw04181-B_014073-014347 that's right got to keep those farmers happy
sw04181-B_014690-014829 uh-huh
sw04181-B_015948-017197 right there i[s]- there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that [laughter-bureaucracy] running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs
sw04181-B_018114-018257 right
sw04181-B_018257-019330 [laughter-and] a lot of it's feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot [laughter-about] this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole
sw04181-B_019330-020792 it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures
sw04181-B_020792-021426 uh be[yond]- beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly
sw04181-B_021426-022196 [laughter-right] right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt
sw04181-B_022196-022733 are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are suppo[sedly]- supposedly fiscally conservative
sw04181-B_023007-023137 [laughter-right]
sw04181-B_023479-023606 right
sw04181-B_023743-023866 um-hum
sw04181-B_024859-025049 that's right
sw04181-B_025351-025957 yeah it's really that is the especially that defense [vocalized-noise] cuts in the defense is really a catch-22
sw04181-B_025957-026901 double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
sw04181-B_026901-027096 so that's that's really
sw04181-B_027096-027692 it's i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these [laughter-policies]
sw04181-B_028438-028560 uh-huh
sw04181-B_028955-029079 right
sw04181-B_029651-029863 that's right
sw04182-A_000000-000055 [noise]
sw04182-A_000526-000896 correct i- i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers
sw04182-A_009185-009325 right
sw04182-A_009325-010713 well i- i- i- i tend to look at it like uh right i mean without without uh you know a suspicion of of you know reasonable suspicion of of something going on i- i would have to probably tend to uh
sw04182-A_010713-012025 uh agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i- i also my my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for uh something the last i heard was not a hundred percent effective
sw04182-A_012025-013038 or you know accurate uh with it not being a hundred percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive
sw04182-A_013038-013196 uh
sw04182-A_013196-013459 absolutely you know that that
sw04182-A_013560-014019 sure sure because i mean it's like uh someone goes on trial for something
sw04182-A_014019-014441 the press lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted
sw04182-A_014441-015342 but uh so there is that i mean but also you know as as someone who does not use any controlled substances i
sw04182-A_015342-016184 you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal
sw04182-A_016184-016648 uh so th[at]- you know that that is a tough things to juggle between the two
sw04182-A_016648-016787 uh
sw04182-A_023843-024112 [vocalized-noise] it also involves due process
sw04182-A_025982-026708 and and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the uh employer have to
sw04182-A_026708-026935 you know to get information about that
sw04182-A_028919-029147 [laughter]
sw04182-A_029147-029338 [laughter]
sw04182-B_000000-000603 [noise] okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place
sw04182-B_000758-001218 yeah yeah my my gut feeling is to
sw04182-B_001218-002234 probably side uh on the the Bill of Rights side of this and say that this it's an unfair [vocalized-noise] invasion of privacy i- i um
sw04182-B_002234-002514 it i have to say that i
sw04182-B_002514-002750 m[y]- from my political point of view
sw04182-B_002750-003897 i tend to be i tend to sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of issues but at the same time uh part of my own picture of the way [vocalized-noise] politics should work in this country is there also should be
sw04182-B_003897-005146 uh regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where uh an uh a working individual uh could do damage for instance a an airline pilot
sw04182-B_005146-006055 uh you know or or somebody who's driving a public carrier like like truck drivers and stuff like that i think that there is a uh far more substantial issue
sw04182-B_006055-007533 uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way um people behave um i think a g[ood]- for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um
sw04182-B_007533-008700 in in like a clerical environment or a a work environment like i'm a i'm a computer programmer so [noise] if i were indulging in activities like that or one of my colleagues were um
sw04182-B_008700-009165 it would seem to me pretty easy to to tell if their performance was suffering for it
sw04182-B_009165-009398 i don't know how do you feel about these things
sw04182-B_011956-012101 um-hum
sw04182-B_012101-012250 um-hum
sw04182-B_012954-013351 sure sure and that could ruin somebody's life
sw04182-B_013351-013584 even if they were vindicated
sw04182-B_016108-016238 sure
sw04182-B_016567-016692 um-hum
sw04182-B_016793-018072 well i have to say i'm i'm a child of the sixties and uh it it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my friends did and i saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives or not not really
sw04182-B_018072-018844 i don't know i guess i saw a couple of friends ruin their lives an[d]- that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like
sw04182-B_018844-019648 you know most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever
sw04182-B_019648-019874 and and they become adults about it
sw04182-B_019874-020558 and uh i[n]- in fact my attitudes about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country
sw04182-B_020558-021353 uh are are that i think that the government should ad[ministrate]- administrate it in a com[pletely]- you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a
sw04182-B_021353-022588 a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the
sw04182-B_022588-022969 fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really
sw04182-B_022969-024048 really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's right to privacy and that sort of thing because uh uh you know i mean
sw04182-B_024048-025041 yeah and and uh it it i you know the fact of the matter is is i think that that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to
sw04182-B_025041-026051 have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to im[pact]- uh have an impact upon his ability to make a a a living and and you know and and keep his livelihood coming in
sw04182-B_026864-027832 sure an[d]- and and uh and and so you know it's uh i so anyway i guess that we're we're largely in agreement in that uh
sw04182-B_027832-028801 case and uh and in fact i think that uh because you know i mean i it's it's literally i you know i'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been um almost
sw04182-B_028801-029885 jeez man maybe twenty years almost since i last had any of that that sort of stuff uh around me but at the same time i don't think that that necessarily gives me a right to s[ay]-
sw04183-A_000000-000100 [noise] okay
sw04183-A_000100-000391 well why did your roommate get a dog
sw04183-A_002219-002435 oh
sw04183-A_002729-002882 oh that's good
sw04183-A_002996-003206 [laughter]
sw04183-A_003206-003408 well is he teething
sw04183-A_003408-003536 yeah
sw04183-A_003819-004668 oh yuck oh yuck well i have a um i have a well i call her my a puppy but she's actually going to ten
sw04183-A_004668-005445 and uh had her all ten years and she she'll rough house with you but she's she's learned very quickly when enough is enough
sw04183-A_005445-006216 but she loves to play and stuff but i don't know she's she's i'm getting ready to i'm fixing to move out in on my own
sw04183-A_006216-007101 and she's going with me and i mean that's i i'm thinking that she's going to be one of my main sources of of companionship in in the beginning
sw04183-A_007628-008004 you mean a [vocalized-noise] as far as protec[tion]- house protection
sw04183-A_008104-008450 oh no no no she had a stroke about two years ago she's blind
sw04183-A_008450-008858 so no no [laughter-she] she's strictly the lovable type
sw04183-A_008858-009205 so no she's she's too little to do that
sw04183-A_010308-010744 so this is this is not your first experience with [vocalized-noise] with a dog
sw04183-A_012013-012159 whoa
sw04183-A_012601-012771 oh
sw04183-A_013308-013511 um um
sw04183-A_013511-014496 well uh let's see a lot of the uh i don't know if you've i've i've been i've heard about a lot of studies and stuff
sw04183-A_014496-015377 and they said that um people that have pets have a lower incidence of um heart disease and stuff like that
sw04183-A_015377-015919 [laughter] yeah you take out all your aggressions on the dog [laughter]
sw04183-A_016180-016370 yeah yeah
sw04183-A_016534-016851 it's a lot better than coming home to an empty house
sw04183-A_016851-017006 so
sw04183-A_017650-018030 oh yeah yeah i- i know what you're talking about yeah
sw04183-A_018030-018456 yeah totally i mean because i mean they know no other

sw04184-A_018649-019513 yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them_1 going it's not good to

sw04184-A_024661-025986 attacking a k[id]- a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
sw04184-A_025986-026175 and you know

sw04184-A_027220-027382 and
sw04184-A_027382-028370 that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was fair[ly]- it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadn't
sw04184-A_028471-029334 yeah i they really should've should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though

sw04185-B_015340-016182 yeah i'm a Christian and i know that that God is supposed to be your priority but your family's priority above church work
sw04185-B_016182-016700 is is what i've always believed my dad was chairman of the deacons in our church
sw04185-B_016700-017723 and he put time with the ch[urch]- church uh uh the church burned by accident um uh uh the you know when i was real young and we were in the process of building another house
sw04185-B_017723-018522 and my dad put working on the church building uh before working with my mother on the house kind of left it to her
sw04185-B_018522-019492 and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church
sw04185-B_019492-020513 right right and and he had more of a desire to be with with the rest of the church members than he did with us and so that that was definitely a problem
sw04185-B_020513-021817 and uh when when my parents divorced i- i think my mother has had trouble staying in church because um she's just she just knows that there's a lot of hypocrites and um
sw04185-B_021817-022200 that yo[u]- you just have to put that part behind you
sw04185-B_022200-022526 oh sure sure and
sw04185-B_022526-023821 oh sure and not everybody is going to get [laughter-along] but uh yeah that that was definitely a a a problem in our in the marriage and they didn't communicate well at all so
sw04185-B_023821-024852 since they weren't spending time with each other hardly at all you know my dad would come home late from work because_1 he'd visit everyone in the community before he'd come home um

sw04186-B_010177-010334 i've had uh
sw04186-B_010334-010884 and the Siberian was basically there for the taking if i wanted it as a puppy

sw04186-B_011330-011482 a[nd]-

sw04186-B_012518-012659 and
sw04186-B_012659-013401 so we wanted a bigger spaniel because_1 we didn't want a cock[er]- as small as a cocker for the husky to beat up
sw04186-B_013401-013655 but the what
sw04186-B_013655-013818 tooth and nail

sw04186-B_014945-015087 yeah right
sw04186-B_015087-016227 dogs don't normally fight serious very long because_1 normally one as big as a Siberian or as small as a spaniel the spaniel knows its place pretty quickly and that takes care of that
sw04186-B_016375-016973 you know it's normally they're at each other just you know snarling and snapping and rolling and thumbing
sw04186-B_016973-017941 and then when they're but when the Siberian's decided that she she's had all that she wants of that hyper spaniel it's it's very clearly stated
sw04186-B_018086-018819 you know there are very clear words spoken in dog and that's the end and the span[iel]- and the and the springer goes [laughter-away]

sw04187-B_029432-030039 no no no no i mean somebody else calls you know so many people have call waiting these days actually we have a completely separate
sw04188-A_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04188-A_000185-001574 sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that ha[d]- had recycling
sw04188-A_001574-002816 band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away
sw04188-A_002816-004125 and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more
sw04188-A_004125-004769 so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state
sw04188-A_004769-005222 uh was being snubbed in this particular town
sw04188-A_005735-005866 no
sw04188-A_005866-006090 no we don't uh
sw04188-A_006252-006871 as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up
sw04188-A_006871-007611 and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and
sw04188-A_007611-008551 bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge about twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service
sw04188-A_009730-009845 um-hum
sw04188-A_010024-010142 right
sw04188-A_010516-010631 right
sw04188-A_010832-011663 well uh i[t]- it's interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh
sw04188-A_011663-012932 [vocalized-noise] during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh
sw04188-A_012932-013254 i guess they figure that they wouldn't uh
sw04188-A_013254-013577 they wouldn't provide that particular service
sw04188-A_013577-014907 uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the the bottles and the the paper and all of that and uh
sw04188-A_014907-016241 you know i'd had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said well this is a great idea you know i like doing this it's not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me
sw04188-A_016241-016885 what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but it's going to cost you
sw04188-A_016885-017135 so i- i was fairly surprised
sw04188-A_017361-017469 yes
sw04188-A_017650-018021 well i really do like it here uh i
sw04188-A_018131-018252 um-hum
sw04188-A_018734-019113 right i'm a[bout]- i'm about uh maybe uh
sw04188-A_019113-019457 quarter of a mile to a half a mile away
sw04188-A_019593-020671 but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that i've noticed is i've seen a few articles in the paper now that uh
sw04188-A_020671-021236 there's more recycled material than people know what to do with
sw04188-A_021236-022417 uh apparently the uh manufacturers the uh glass people the plastics people the paper people aren't using enough of the recyclables
sw04188-A_022417-022565 to uh
sw04188-A_022565-023619 to keep the chain going so there's a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and it's actually
sw04188-A_023860-024540 i don't know i i've seen it a couple of times and i'm i'm i couldn't cite the source [vocalized-noise] right now
sw04188-A_025029-025143 um-hum
sw04188-A_025404-025528 right
sw04188-A_026217-026316 right
sw04188-A_026530-027908 w[ell]- it's true we uh in this state don't have a bottle bill and every time it's raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i it's
sw04188-A_027908-029246 i- i really can't see why people would get that upset about it because once it's in place it doesn't seem all that uh that difficult to manage
sw04188-B_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04188-B_000015-000253 okay want to go ahead and start then

sw04188-B_008582-009179 down down here in [vocalized-noise] isn't too much of a tax burden up [laughter-there] but uh down here it's uh
sw04188-B_009179-010077 they have uh the the garbage company picks it up for us and they what we do is we have to separate this stuff you know papers and and plastic materials and glass
sw04188-B_010077-010560 and uh they'll they'll they come by in a separate truck and i guess it's paid for with taxpayer's money
sw04188-B_010560-010840 but up there i guess you guys are saving the tax payers uh
sw04188-B_013535-013759 oh i see yeah
sw04188-B_016832-016938 yeah

sw04190-A_007317-007428 and

sw04190-A_007861-009098 and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i sai[d]- i said i- i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars an[d]-
sw04190-A_009098-010199 he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fi[ngers]- fingers in the pie too
sw04190-A_010199-010591 and that's it's sort of like trickling down for the overall cost
sw04190-A_010591-010917 and the the doctors
sw04190-A_010917-011062 have
sw04190-A_011062-011195 um
sw04190-A_011195-011277 [noise]
sw04190-A_011513-012236 might say a production line and just like i- i said well how much is it going to cost he goes well it'll cost you

sw04190-A_013030-013359 and so it'll cost you a hundred and two dollars well
sw04190-A_013359-014639 i knew which tooth it was and he knew it was too and all i needed was extract it but he wanted he wanted to make the money so they're they're they're taught that people should have certain services whe[ther]- regardless of whether they need them or not

sw04190-A_019669-019996 and in fact i was watching on the TV
sw04190-A_019996-021134 is that if you work for a small company just say maybe thirty to forty employees and you have they're insured and your employees are sure are insured under what's called the group plan
sw04190-A_021134-021617 well if one or two of the people in that group
sw04190-A_021617-022995 happened to have a chronic illness where it it you need they need care all the time like say they had a child that that needed uh a lung machine and a respirator and a nurse to come in and things like this
sw04190-A_022995-023812 well what they would do is they would just cancel everybody's insurance and say we're not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance

sw04190-B_005789-005999 there's not going to be anybody that can afford it
sw04190-B_009203-009295 [noise]
sw04190-B_014571-014678 exactly
sw04190-B_014783-014952 and they're making it
sw04190-B_014952-016037 almost impossible for people to go and get well routine care shall we say insurance now won't cover uh wellness visits
sw04190-B_016037-016620 or uh children baby visits your insurance won't cover that anymore
sw04190-B_016620-017412 and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesn't even cover things like that
sw04190-B_017412-017816 and the thing is just like dental hospitalization and dental it's unbelievable
sw04190-B_017816-019906 you can go to the hospital and you'll pay four dollars for a aspirin
sw04190-B_019906-020027 [noise]
sw04190-B_021069-021200 uh-huh
sw04190-B_023759-023882 exactly
sw04190-B_023882-024801 our our group medical plan has increased every year in the past three years uh i work for Edward D Jones stockbrokerage
sw04190-B_024801-025004 and it's just every year
sw04190-B_025004-025865 every year is just a little bit more of course our y[ou]- our cost um aren't hardly anything compared to people that have to go out and get their own because of the group plan but
sw04190-B_025865-026105 it is the costs have increased every year
sw04190-B_026804-027017 um-hum exactly
sw04190-B_027017-027747 we did start a plan this year there's an insurance company through Metropolitan Life that has started a flexible plan
sw04190-B_027747-028089 and with that they will take out pre tax dollars
sw04190-B_028089-028818 and build it up and it will cover things that your regular insurance won't eyeglasses uh dentist visits
sw04190-B_028818-029636 uh wellness care prescriptions that are not covered through your insurance and that's the first time i have seen any
sw04190-B_029636-029850 e[ffort]- effort at all
sw04190-B_029850-029994 to make a change in the
sw04191-A_000000-000272 so do you think we have an immigration problem right now
sw04191-A_001989-002098 um-hum
sw04191-A_004362-004503 um-hum
sw04191-A_004503-005269 well i think i think there's still is a lot of land it's just not particularly desirable land yeah i think i think you know the plains were never completely settled
sw04191-A_005269-005410 uh
sw04191-A_005517-005643 you know
sw04191-A_005643-005946 uh you know i'm i'm sure we i'm i'm i'm sure that you know
sw04191-A_005946-006597 there's plenty of room fo[r]- room for immigrants in North and South Dakota but i just don't think that [laughter-most] immigrants want to move to North or South Dakota
sw04191-A_008121-008229 um-hum
sw04191-A_008787-009178 yeah i've been hearing about that it seemed like the silliest thing i'd ever heard you know th[e]-
sw04191-A_009178-009270 [vocalized-noise]
sw04191-A_009270-009668 [vocalized-noise] you you can immigrate totally without merit
sw04191-A_009668-009838 but um
sw04191-A_009947-010225 because you know you you get the lucky number [laughter]

sw04191-A_013975-014086 um-hum
sw04191-A_014086-014538 i probably agree w[ell]- wh[at]- what do you think we could do to make it better

sw04191-A_022742-022901 um-hum
sw04191-A_022901-023084 i[t]- it it seems
sw04191-A_023084-023526 you know it seems almost as absurd as a few years ago when um
sw04191-A_023526-024279 and w[e]- uh you know we'd welcome uh refugees from Nicaragua for political reasons but you know if they're from El Salvador then [laughter]
sw04191-A_024279-024783 then they couldn't be fleeing to for political reasons because you know w[e]- we were friends with that government
sw04191-A_025782-025877 um-hum
sw04191-A_027145-027251 um-hum
sw04191-A_028673-029121 were this skills that you know that are really marketable in our country
sw04191-A_029382-029789 because you know you know of the yeah the the see especially hard to
sw04191-A_029789-029840 [noise]
sw04191-B_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04191-B_000315-001562 well it's hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from Haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence
sw04191-B_001562-001802 of uh political
sw04191-B_001802-002029 uh repression
sw04191-B_002029-002185 uh
sw04191-B_002185-002871 the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people
sw04191-B_002871-003709 from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but [vocalized-noise] uh was back in the days when there was a lot of
sw04191-B_003709-004445 a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now
sw04191-B_005214-005365 that's true
sw04191-B_006436-007072 [laughter] that uh that's true the uh
sw04191-B_007072-008178 i- i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble
sw04191-B_008178-008847 uh there was a e[ssentially]- essentially an immigration lottery a few months back
sw04191-B_009175-009266 it
sw04191-B_009608-009725 um-hum
sw04191-B_010161-010302 right
sw04191-B_010302-011434 and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from Ireland
sw04191-B_011434-011623 and how
sw04191-B_011623-012187 how a decision like that is made uh oh we don't have enough Irish in this country
sw04191-B_012187-013546 just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i- i don't understand
sw04191-B_013546-014029 how this is all working and i'm not sure the people who are running it understand it either
sw04191-B_014492-014590 [noise]
sw04191-B_014804-015345 that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question
sw04191-B_015345-015723 i don't know that there's
sw04191-B_015723-016213 there's a lot we can do short of either
sw04191-B_016213-017286 uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its
sw04191-B_017286-017941 i[t]- i[t]- it's going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh
sw04191-B_017941-018245 and other problems like that
sw04191-B_018245-018347 uh
sw04191-B_018492-019042 it's interesting to me to see the uh the current administration
sw04191-B_019042-020497 welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from Haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment
sw04191-B_020497-020636 uh
sw04191-B_020636-021311 given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in Haiti it it's uh
sw04191-B_021311-022427 contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they don't like the uh
sw04191-B_022427-022839 the government the current government that overthrew the democracy
sw04191-B_023150-023254 [noise]
sw04191-B_023936-024040 um-hum
sw04191-B_024040-024169 right
sw04191-B_024285-024401 right
sw04191-B_024725-024834 right
sw04191-B_024935-025813 and i- i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration
sw04191-B_025813-027162 is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes we'll let these people in because uh w[e]- we don't like their government
sw04191-B_027162-027297 uh
sw04191-B_027297-027623 i[t]- i[t]- it's an odd situation
sw04191-B_027623-028737 of course we haven't touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh
sw04191-B_028846-028994 or any [vocalized-noise]
sw04191-B_029094-029173 right

sw04192-A_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04192-A_000024-000174 alright what do you think
sw04192-A_003447-003700 right right
sw04192-A_005396-006800 hum okay well um i- i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i- i read one time about um somebody's developed uh a test to look at the emissions from um your car
sw04192-A_006800-007674 you know you know i- i just don't under[stand]- i mean everybody's so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that's pulled away from the focus of air pollution
sw04192-A_007674-008998 and we're making all these changes with cars and everything and and and battling to have US built cars versus other countries and we're not looking at [noise] um the air quality that we're producing from our cars
sw04192-A_012100-012450 yeah i- i- i hadn't heard anything about that
sw04192-A_012450-013730 well you know until these older model cars i mean granted i have an older model car [laughter] but i mean some of the some of the really older ones that you know the mufflers falling off you know and they're not quiet up to specs but they're still being driven around
sw04192-A_013730-014676 you know and you can i mean i'd go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them
sw04192-A_014676-015498 you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can't see and smell
sw04192-A_017143-017348 that's right
sw04192-A_021399-021600 that's right
sw04192-A_021600-021750 that's
sw04192-A_021930-022890 well i know in Dallas um i'm i- i live pretty close to downtown to Dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i'm not leaving here today you know
sw04192-A_022890-023900 and and i mean there's uh there's a place that used to be called Concrete City and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead
sw04192-A_023900-024900 and now you know i mean here they've been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they're just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they've done is is wrong
sw04192-A_024900-026024 you know and now we're trying to clean that up but you know we've seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it's had on the atmosphere that we don't know yet
sw04192-A_026024-027155 you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now
sw04192-A_027299-027428 so
sw04192-A_028429-028549 um-hum
sw04192-A_028549-029500 [noise]
sw04192-A_029500-029648 right
sw04192-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04192-B_000099-001078 well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
sw04192-B_001078-002368 and there's just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the United States are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
sw04192-B_002368-003421 and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big uh number
sw04192-B_003549-004299 um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their uh
sw04192-B_004299-005472 air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at Los Angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because_1 they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
sw04192-B_006426-006577 uh-huh
sw04192-B_006730-006871 right
sw04192-B_007572-007749 uh-huh
sw04192-B_008419-008518 uh-huh
sw04192-B_008874-009300 right and there was j[ust]- i just saw today that uh
sw04192-B_009300-010250 President Bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh
sw04192-B_010250-011050 is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in Michigan
sw04192-B_011050-012148 and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me
sw04192-B_012352-012500 uh-huh
sw04192-B_012922-013077 right
sw04192-B_013369-013499 uh-huh
sw04192-B_013651-013800 right
sw04192-B_014599-014750 uh-huh
sw04192-B_014750-014898 [laughter]
sw04192-B_015398-016175 right exactly uh the another thing i don't know here in the Midwest in Indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
sw04192-B_016175-017246 and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
sw04192-B_017246-018670 i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
sw04192-B_018670-019524 and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in Indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in New York state and in Canada and all that
sw04192-B_019524-020250 and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these uh
sw04192-B_020250-021276 sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
sw04192-B_021276-021828 you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of
sw04192-B_021828-021999 bothers me [laughter]
sw04192-B_022300-022449 uh-huh
sw04192-B_022774-022949 [laughter-yeah]

sw04192-B_027048-027196 right
sw04192-B_027300-028518 yeah all and all i think that we really i mean al[most]- if you look at almost any industry it's it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
sw04192-B_028518-029863 and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said e[ven]- the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the p[ast]-
sw04193-A_000000-000099 [noise]

sw04193-B_000371-000970 yeah r[ead]- i catch the news sometimes uh but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work
sw04193-B_000970-001596 uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
sw04193-B_001703-001798 [noise]
sw04193-B_002596-003198 yeah i- i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because_1 i don't always call my broker and things
sw04193-B_003198-003874 but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon
sw04193-B_003874-004698 uh so we listen to NPR a lot and we hear we listen to Morning Edition in the morning and Fresh Air and All Things Considered in the afternoon
sw04193-B_004698-005445 so uh and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and
sw04193-B_006246-007403 yeah i- i'd like to get you know things little s[traight]- a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise Clinton won in the South you know
sw04193-B_007403-007900 you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day
sw04193-B_007900-008049 um
sw04193-B_008049-008670 but you know i- i find especially NPR is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch CNN a lot when i got cable
sw04193-B_008670-009278 because_1 uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting
sw04193-B_009278-010446 uh our local papers like the Boston Globe you know where you we have you know you've got the Boston Globe which is extreme in one way and the Manchester Union Leader which like supports Buchanan and things
sw04193-B_010446-011701 so between the [laughter-two] [laughter-of] [laughter-them] you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the Boston Phoenix Weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting
sw04193-B_012875-014345 yeah and and i- i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there
sw04193-B_014345-015497 uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks
sw04193-B_015497-015598 um
sw04193-B_015598-015849 i really think that um
sw04193-B_015849-017100 you know you have to go to some uh place like NPR that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because_1 they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news
sw04193-B_017100-017698 and the other nice thing about my local uh NPR station is they also got monitor radio and the BBC
sw04193-B_017698-018170 through yeah they do [vocalized-noise] this this is basically our all news AM station 10A
sw04193-B_018170-019368 so what you get is you get uh they they've kind of picked up so you get like five AM they give BBC then you've got [vocalized-noise] uh you've got Morning Edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the BBC
sw04193-B_019368-020526 then in the afternoon you get uh the NPR's talk show and then you've got uh Fresh Air at four All Things Considered till seven then you get Market Place then they give you BBC again
sw04193-B_020526-021402 so it's really you know f[or]- they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources
sw04193-B_021402-022271 and you know it's kind of neat to see how the BBC reports things differently you know th[ey]- they've got a much different view like reporting South Africa and the Middle East
sw04193-B_022271-023080 um i find that NPR and the BBC has a much more global view than like ABC or one of the US ones
sw04193-B_023201-024149 but you know because_1 you know i find that um a the the American uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric
sw04193-B_024149-024300 where
sw04193-B_024300-025075 you know they they they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not not just us lucky people
sw04193-B_025075-025199 um
sw04193-B_025301-026747 so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know i'll i'll glance through the Boston Globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the uh like the Milford Cabinet uh the National Telegraph to get the really local news
sw04193-B_026747-027299 yeah it's like the Globe gives you like regional news uh and Boston news
sw04193-B_027299-027647 like my fiance is telling me the Globe sucks uh
sw04193-B_027647-029098 and and then you get like uh you know the uh the Telegraph and the Cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the T[elegraph]- in the in the Cabinet because_1 we went to the school board meeting
sw04193-B_029098-029946 so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage
sw04194-A_000000-000950 [noise] i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up
sw04194-A_000950-001948 um i'd started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on
sw04194-A_001948-003277 and got it all set up and then kind of got it tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were
sw04194-A_003277-003519 i don't think i've looked at that thing in a year and a half
sw04194-A_005227-005374 um
sw04194-A_006175-006303 yeah
sw04194-A_007079-007249 [vocalized-noise]
sw04194-A_007749-008968 yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it
sw04194-A_009075-009550 well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where there's a lot of
sw04194-A_009550-010350 uh fri[volous]- frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things
sw04194-A_010350-010949 it's hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff
sw04194-A_010949-012231 reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them_1 all and tape them_1 on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed
sw04194-A_012231-012702 and uh man that that ended it in about a week um [noise]
sw04194-A_012702-012999 yeah very similar procedure
sw04194-A_013549-013949 [laughter]
sw04194-A_015247-015723 really that has got to be one of the worst problems we've got here today
sw04194-A_015723-016264 and it's hardly considered you know here it is uh a an elec[tion]- election year and you hardly hear anything about it
sw04194-A_016264-016923 especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us
sw04194-A_017671-017972 yeah yep
sw04194-A_020344-020499 [laughter]
sw04194-A_020901-021199 um yep
sw04194-A_021380-021799 [laughter]
sw04194-A_022346-022744 yeah colleges and education in many ways
sw04194-A_023299-023623 [laughter]
sw04194-A_023850-024599 i haven't resorted to um peanut butter but i have had to go to long periods of ragu and um pasta
sw04194-A_024897-025323 ooh ooh actually we've got a stash of that we had a cat but it ran away
sw04194-A_025402-025680 um so we've got a good bit
sw04194-A_025680-026220 we've got a dog now and it'll eat the cat food though that's its treat at the end of the day
sw04194-A_026220-026905 well he's a puppy i don't think he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet
sw04194-A_026905-027404 it's good food fortunately that's cheap and it fits in the budget twenty five cents a can
sw04194-A_027777-028600 well i've been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah that's uh it hasn't been real successful but he barks real well
sw04194-A_029275-029450 uh uh
sw04194-A_029450-029895 [laughter]
sw04194-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04194-B_001699-001899 [laughter]
sw04194-B_003398-003637 [laughter]
sw04194-B_003637-004473 uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time
sw04194-B_004473-005300 and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it
sw04194-B_005300-006223 because_1 to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along
sw04194-B_006223-007272 uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years we're all of a sudden uh it's IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money
sw04194-B_007272-007778 but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head
sw04194-B_008898-009100 how does it pay off for you
sw04194-B_010901-011073 right
sw04194-B_011280-011578 [laughter]
sw04194-B_012478-012611 [noise]
sw04194-B_012611-012827 and the same thing for the budget huh
sw04194-B_012948-013646 interesting i- i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous
sw04194-B_013646-014900 and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to Congress uh
sw04194-B_014900-015150 uh in terms of actually considering a budget
sw04194-B_015150-015225 [laughter]
sw04194-B_015225-015325 and staying with it
sw04194-B_015325-015476 [noise]
sw04194-B_015676-015847 right
sw04194-B_016174-016374 right right
sw04194-B_016700-016849 yep
sw04194-B_016849-017329 and so i think we as a society tend to have
sw04194-B_017329-017899 uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean we're having fun
sw04194-B_017899-018869 and so i guess i'm kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent
sw04194-B_018869-020299 actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February
sw04194-B_020299-020920 uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating
sw04194-B_020920-021000 [laughter]
sw04194-B_021000-022400 uh i it was called subsist on peanut butter and jelly for the the month and at one point some girls in a sorority that i kn[ew]- uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back room and fed me a salad
sw04194-B_022400-022500 [noise]
sw04194-B_022500-022622 [vocalized-noise]
sw04194-B_022622-023926 you bet you bet i think the reason why they did it was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of [laughter] disease like that
sw04194-B_024421-024700 [laughter]
sw04194-B_024700-024900 well at least you're not down to cat food
sw04194-B_024900-025099 uh
sw04194-B_025278-025450 oh no
sw04194-B_026029-026299 sounds like a dog with a complex
sw04194-B_026299-026499 [laughter]
sw04194-B_026828-026977 uh great
sw04194-B_026977-027149 [laughter]
sw04194-B_027298-027828 yeah right right well as long as you're not teaching him how to meow or something like that
sw04194-B_028025-028200 oh really
sw04194-B_028549-029100 uh reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a pig to sing
sw04194-B_029100-029549 the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig
sw04194-B_029549-029895 [laughter]
sw04195-A_000000-000008 [noise]
sw04195-A_000008-000150 how old are your kids
sw04195-A_000250-000374 oh yeah

sw04195-A_001880-002099 right
sw04195-A_002298-003300 yeah that's that's fantastic yeah um a lot of times well i guess the majority of their of their early growing up years they had a full family right
sw04195-A_003499-003849 oh so he traveled around a bit and was on duty
sw04195-A_003849-003998 okay

sw04195-A_005514-005649 [laughter]
sw04195-A_006277-006398 [laughter]
sw04195-A_006398-006749 that's a euphemism huh that's a euphemism huh
sw04195-A_006749-006897 [laughter]
sw04195-A_007648-007799 um-hum
sw04195-A_007999-008149 right
sw04195-A_008429-008599 right
sw04195-A_008998-009149 um-hum
sw04195-A_009449-009576 yeah
sw04195-A_009680-010149 great that sounds good sounds like there's some quality time being spent there

sw04195-A_016447-017946 a lot of people frown on that just on on TV in general but i don't know i- i think my own personal opinion is that it it helps to instill a sense of values and moral as long as it could be ex[plained]- explained and as long as there's good monitoring going on
sw04195-A_018147-018300 right
sw04195-A_018818-018972 um-hum

sw04195-A_023976-025349 that's good i my sister my closest sister is the same way in terms of day care pretty much to where she really tries to not have them in day care because you tend to pick up bad habits that way and oth[er]- other people
sw04195-A_025596-026925 right you don't know what kind of moral people are inflicting on your children and things like that so yeah that's a good thing i'm i'm myself am am not married but am beg your pardon

sw04195-A_027549-028622 uh right now i'm i'm getting closer to marriage and things are getting very serious and we're talking about these kind of issues and things so good to hear a viewpoint from someone who is actually in the situation

sw04195-B_004576-004724 um-hum

sw04195-B_013698-013877 um
sw04195-B_013978-014373 pretty much pretty much because_1 we've had pretty weather

sw04195-B_028149-028298 um-hum
sw04195-B_028598-029904 yeah i- i think it's important to really think really hard before you get married and before you have kids and and when you make that commitment to stand by it not to a few years later go well
sw04196-A_000000-000348 [noise] Steve yeah how do you keep up on current affairs
sw04196-A_001450-001600 uh
sw04196-A_002424-002600 [laughter]
sw04196-A_002701-002849 uh-huh
sw04196-A_002849-003048 that's a good way of looking at it
sw04196-A_003248-003370 uh-huh
sw04196-A_005100-005399 slightly liberal to the left or to the right
sw04196-A_005527-005679 what'd you say
sw04196-A_006078-006249 [vocalized-noise]
sw04196-A_006527-006699 i see huh
sw04196-A_006827-006979 uh-huh
sw04196-A_007899-008001 uh-huh
sw04196-A_008149-008274 uh-huh
sw04196-A_008274-009015 well i get my uh news from really from all the sources uh i will say probably radio is uh
sw04196-A_009015-010300 is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news uh on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the TV for
sw04196-A_010300-011272 for news and i take two newspaper uh the local city newspaper here in Portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the Manchester Union Leader so uh
sw04196-A_011272-012048 you know that's that's how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if it's real important you're going to hear about it from other people besides
sw04196-A_013148-013350 um-hum
sw04196-A_015150-015297 right
sw04196-A_016399-016577 uh-huh
sw04196-A_017073-017249 no
sw04196-A_017249-017600 but you do but you do i- i take it
sw04196-A_017730-017900 uh-huh
sw04196-A_019096-019247 uh-huh
sw04196-A_020049-020200 i see
sw04196-A_020999-021150 um-hum
sw04196-A_022100-022250 um-hum
sw04196-A_022647-023925 well we have a sports interaction with Quebec mainly uh Montreal uh the teams there uh both baseball and with uh with hockey of course and with Quebec and uh Quebec City
sw04196-A_023925-025047 and also uh one of the uh T[V]- TV stations uh from Canada is on the cable system in this area uh from Sherbrook
sw04196-A_025047-025550 so uh we we do have some news from from Canada from time to time
sw04196-A_026720-026976 do you have CNN do you have CNN
sw04196-A_027149-027477 that can be an important source of news international
sw04196-A_027848-027998 um-hum
sw04196-A_028875-029003 right
sw04196-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04196-B_000249-001602 well Frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um
sw04196-B_001602-002950 i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um
sw04196-B_002950-003600 [noise] that's i guess that's primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh
sw04196-B_003600-004779 do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know
sw04196-B_004779-005223 you end up and you say well yeah okay and you
sw04196-B_005328-005528 uh
sw04196-B_005671-005896 oh i would say maybe it's
sw04196-B_005896-007000 a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh it's a fairly liberal minded um
sw04196-B_007100-007799 but you know it's uh you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of uh
sw04196-B_007799-008252 a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened
sw04196-B_011898-013229 right yeah i- i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide
sw04196-B_013229-013625 um here i guess really we're dealing with uh
sw04196-B_013726-013950 the regions being
sw04196-B_014050-014673 i- i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's uh
sw04196-B_014673-015218 several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved
sw04196-B_015218-016447 and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international
sw04196-B_016447-017199 and and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much North Dakota news
sw04196-B_017199-017428 um you know so
sw04196-B_017549-018219 uh w[e]- we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of North Dakota we
sw04196-B_018219-019171 uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between North Dakota and Saskatchewan
sw04196-B_019171-020149 and uh it's not hardly an current event as such but um Minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down
sw04196-B_020149-021400 um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and uh so then it has
sw04196-B_021400-022600 anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh
sw04196-B_023698-023852 um-hum
sw04196-B_024748-024875 oh yeah
sw04196-B_024980-025099 um-hum
sw04196-B_025449-025599 yeah
sw04196-B_025599-026900 it's uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three Detroit stations and we've got three Saskatchewan stations with
sw04196-B_026900-027328 uh yes we do we also have CNN which
sw04196-B_027328-028448 yes uh yeah i- i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh
sw04196-B_028448-029249 so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a
sw04196-B_029249-029946 regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh
sw04197-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04197-A_000049-001200 all right um [laughter] well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it
sw04197-A_001200-002449 um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used
sw04197-A_002449-002599 so
sw04197-A_005249-005497 um-hum right
sw04197-A_005844-006147 yeah i think i think
sw04197-A_006275-006449 um-hum
sw04197-A_006802-006999 right right
sw04197-A_007599-007772 [laughter]
sw04197-A_007772-007877 [noise]
sw04197-A_008150-009300 exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs
sw04197-A_009300-010143 y[ou]- well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like uh yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh
sw04197-A_010143-010196 [laughter]
sw04197-A_010196-011050 killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um
sw04197-A_011050-012180 i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level
sw04197-A_012180-013049 uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um
sw04197-A_013049-013600 and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation
sw04197-A_013600-014868 um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um
sw04197-A_014868-015800 but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so
sw04197-A_016046-017397 um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um
sw04197-A_017397-018248 why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on
sw04197-A_021750-021899 um-hum
sw04197-A_022001-022148 [laughter]
sw04197-A_023549-023700 [laughter]
sw04197-A_023800-024149 yes oh yeah i agree exactly um
sw04197-A_024500-024649 um-hum
sw04197-A_024898-025548 oh yeah yeah i well i think we're seeing a major decline um but
sw04197-A_025548-026049 um i'm i'm not sure how that relates directly to taxation um
sw04197-A_026049-026229 [laughter]
sw04197-A_026229-026549 uh trying to stay on the topic here [laughter]
sw04197-A_026977-027127 right
sw04197-A_027377-027528 yeah
sw04197-A_027528-027747 [laughter]
sw04197-A_028572-028747 hum
sw04197-A_029299-029448 um-hum
sw04197-A_029849-029968 right
sw04197-B_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04197-B_000015-000127 okay you first
sw04197-B_000127-000295 [noise] [laughter]
sw04197-B_002447-003174 yeah i- i agree i don't think it's uh effectively used um as far as the amount um
sw04197-B_003174-003524 i'm never really sure about the amount because there's so much that
sw04197-B_003524-004450 needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but
sw04197-B_004450-005446 there's a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily
sw04197-B_005446-005926 and uh i- i agree with you that things are just not used effectively
sw04197-B_005926-006948 and we you know people don't want to live within their means we've got huge deficits that doesn't appear to you know nobody's talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all
sw04197-B_007054-008325 and i was amazed in the State of the Union address and Bush i don't think mentioned the D word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and i'm like okay where is the money coming from
sw04197-B_008325-008450 yeah
sw04197-B_008779-008897 um-hum
sw04197-B_009526-009727 right [vocalized-noise]
sw04197-B_010026-010170 yeah
sw04197-B_011222-011350 um-hum
sw04197-B_012149-012299 um-hum
sw04197-B_013548-013750 yeah yeah
sw04197-B_014726-014873 um-hum
sw04197-B_015547-015700 yeah yeah
sw04197-B_015798-016145 and round most of those are state administered aren't they
sw04197-B_016277-016403 um-hum
sw04197-B_016779-016924 okay
sw04197-B_017646-017827 right right
sw04197-B_018150-019550 right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about_1 states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Ar[kansas]- and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it
sw04197-B_019550-020749 states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but
sw04197-B_020749-021148 still their economy never really got off the ground and
sw04197-B_021148-022349 you know it it i don't know i don't live in Louisiana or any of those states and i don't ever think that i will but so it's really none of my business but it's like something you know i- i it's
sw04197-B_022349-023603 i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but
sw04197-B_023603-023975 you know the the rest of us in the country at least
sw04197-B_023975-025099 and then i yeah i know there's plenty of people in California here who don't have enough education either i mean you know that's always the a major political football problem in any state the education system
sw04197-B_025299-025428 yeah
sw04197-B_025927-026149 yeah that's true that's true
sw04197-B_026149-026271 [laughter]
sw04197-B_026424-026519 [noise]
sw04197-B_026519-027440 yeah well i don't think it really matters anyway because_1 it you know they'll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction
sw04197-B_027440-028247 but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isn't really
sw04197-B_028247-028873 it it isn't taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that
sw04197-B_028873-029968 [vocalized-noise] people people don't have an idea that the whole we're all in this together and in the eighties that wasn't the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of
sw04198-A_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04198-A_000032-001027 oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because_1 of because_1 of the latest check writing scandal [laughter]
sw04198-A_001027-001700 [laughter] i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund
sw04198-A_001700-001999 uh i don't know what do you think
sw04198-A_004245-004548 [laughter]
sw04198-A_005375-006800 well it sort of i- i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manag[er]- managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to
sw04198-A_006800-007224 uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals
sw04198-A_007224-007400 so
sw04198-A_008125-008250 um-hum
sw04198-A_009174-009345 um-hum
sw04198-A_011641-011849 um-hum
sw04198-A_016467-017400 um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i- i don't know i- i uh i rather think we're not going to see the end of the deficit for some time
sw04198-A_017400-018800 although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall i'm not sure they're they're kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now
sw04198-A_018800-019497 uh running against Washington so that's so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know
sw04198-A_019497-020200 trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking that's kind of strange i don't think they're going to
sw04198-A_020200-021185 i don't think i don't know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially
sw04198-A_021185-021999 you know we had Robert K Dornam who's been a gap fly of a lot of uh he's he's been uh
sw04198-A_021999-022300 uh Orange County's um
sw04198-A_022430-023528 uh [laughter] i don't know i embarrassment i guess he's he's really terrible they um never voted down a a weapon's package ever
sw04198-A_023528-024277 and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that [vocalized-noise] that one check that he he uh he
sw04198-A_024277-025698 he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a Madonna for his for [laughter-his] for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny
sw04198-A_026896-027497 yeah yeah i very much so um you know
sw04198-A_027726-027950 um-hum
sw04198-A_028450-028622 yeah
sw04198-A_028875-029426 do you think it's because other people because people are spending other people money they got
sw04198-B_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04198-B_001647-001776 okay
sw04198-B_002099-002604 well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to
sw04198-B_002604-003381 uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up
sw04198-B_003381-004318 and [noise] seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization
sw04198-B_004318-004422 [noise]
sw04198-B_004422-005405 centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency
sw04198-B_007098-007281 [noise]
sw04198-B_007281-008150 well i think one of the problem is again isn't really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect
sw04198-B_008150-008474 further removed cause and effect get the the uh
sw04198-B_008474-008815 more problems you have i remember an incident um
sw04198-B_008815-008918 [noise]
sw04198-B_008918-009229 back when i was in Dallas
sw04198-B_009331-010000 where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh
sw04198-B_010000-010129 [noise]
sw04198-B_010129-010748 i don't remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that
sw04198-B_010748-011750 that they they wouldn't really have to pay for them i think they'd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest
sw04198-B_011750-012498 and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to
sw04198-B_012498-013849 uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government
sw04198-B_013849-015078 and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why
sw04198-B_015078-015199 um
sw04198-B_015376-016048 centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have
sw04198-B_016048-016500 um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it
sw04198-B_019400-019554 hum
sw04198-B_025597-027054 well i think it's easy to you know once you get in the position of power it's easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying
sw04198-B_027348-027802 it's hard to be ethical i think

sw04199-B_013499-013676 [laughter]
sw04199-B_013777-014171 [laughter] yeah that's right when i graduated yeah
sw04199-B_014400-014898 not i went to one football game down here in Florida i watched Miami Dolphins
sw04199-B_014898-015997 well [laughter] actually terrible they built that Joe Robbie Stadium there in uh in Miami and it's not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south Florida it just it just comes down in buckets
sw04199-B_015997-016598 and that particular Sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel
sw04199-B_016598-017700 all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there they've got little drains but they don't they don't drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees
sw04199-B_017700-018200 and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold
sw04199-B_018200-019201 and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them_1 and putting them_1 over their heads and stuff
sw04199-B_019201-020146 but the but the that that game they played the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami was beating them_1 at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game
sw04199-B_020146-020949 so my my football experience down here in Florida has been very bad when i was in Michigan i loved to go watch U of M play uh i played high school football
sw04199-B_020949-021800 you know so i you know that's that's why i kept up with the sport but in Michigan it's a lot different because_1 you can go there and it's cool weather you know down here it's hot weather it's hard to get into football
sw04199-B_021947-022900 that really get you in the mood that late autumn sun and it's nice and cool and you can bring in some peppermint Schnapps with you in the game [laughter] you know what i mean [noise]

sw04199-B_024670-025848 yeah but when you're there it doesn't seem that bad because_1 everybody's all all real nice and everything and uh like i say you just take a little hip flask of peppermint Schnapps or or something like that and everything goes real [laughter-good] [vocalized-noise] [noise]
sw04199-B_025848-026422 yeah you have like big tailgate parties there's like a golf course right near there and everybody uh has big tailgate parties you know that's
sw04199-B_026422-027821 get like a big bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and eat that before the game and drink beers and stuff like that and you go on out and watch the game it's really neat then after the game Ann Arbor is such a nice town uh it's a big uh it's a football town in the fall i mean it's just an all college town all around it's real fun

sw04200-A_003198-003450 yeah sounds like it
sw04200-A_003450-004149 yeah a lot of people uh don't get any newspapers and you're getting two that's uh definitely kind of shows your interest in it [noise]
sw04200-A_004149-005148 so do you do that for uh because um the morning journal paper is got more of uh a liberal or type bias
sw04200-A_005148-005900 [noise]
sw04200-A_005900-006048 uh-huh
sw04200-A_006798-006949 um-hum
sw04200-A_007976-008125 um-hum
sw04200-A_008548-008671 right
sw04200-A_008777-009348 so the uh Gwinnete paper that's owned by uh is it Wall Street Journal
sw04200-A_009348-009547 New York Times okay
sw04200-A_011098-011246 um-hum
sw04200-A_011772-011924 uh-huh
sw04200-A_013072-014100 um-hum so this something that you do uh just for your own personal interest it doesn't have anything to do with your job you're not in a job where you need to keep up on these current events
sw04200-A_014374-014528 okay
sw04200-A_015228-015372 uh-huh
sw04200-A_015499-015649 oh really
sw04200-A_015649-015873 you going to run for elected office
sw04200-A_016498-016627 uh-huh
sw04200-A_016726-017171 yeah that's good how did you do in you your first uh r[un]- election
sw04200-A_017473-017621 um
sw04200-A_018071-018350 yeah for a third party right
sw04200-A_018350-019050 yeah and you probably uh you know more and more people are probably leaning toward that third party now the way things are going
sw04200-A_019050-019176 huh
sw04200-A_019380-019599 right hum
sw04200-A_019745-020574 uh i guess newspapers uh i get i subscribe to the morning [noise] the Constitution um
sw04200-A_020574-020700 [noise]
sw04200-A_020700-021399 pub[lication]- uh journal publications for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in in terms of the work that i do
sw04200-A_021399-021549 um
sw04200-A_021549-022098 magazines US News and World Report Time magazine uh a lot of
sw04200-A_022200-023305 uh-huh yeah and you know things like Sports Illustrated uh computer magazines uh uh i don't know if you read the National Review
sw04200-A_024149-024299 [laughter]
sw04200-A_024427-024577 oh wow
sw04200-A_024773-024899 um-hum
sw04200-A_025348-025500 sure
sw04200-A_025797-026078 i- i don't know what that is no
sw04200-A_026225-026349 um
sw04200-A_026823-026946 uh-huh
sw04200-A_027399-027528 um-hum
sw04200-A_029098-029600 um-hum so uh what you're in the you're an engineer
sw04200-B_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04200-B_000347-001229 well i- i subscribe to two different newspapers the Gwinnete Daily News and the Journal so morning and afternoon and
sw04200-B_001229-002500 [noise] i guess that's where i get most of it and then i al[ways]- whenever i'm in the car i'm listening to WGST or WSB and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh
sw04200-B_002500-003546 uh i'm kind of addicted to Headline News and C-SPAN and CNN so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers
sw04200-B_003999-004329 yeah [laughter] um
sw04200-B_005047-006000 oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the Journal and the Constitution i'd take the Journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists
sw04200-B_006000-006299 um and also
sw04200-B_006299-007198 didn't want to take two morning papers and sin[ce]- since i live in Gwinnete County i want to take the Daily News to get their Gwinnete coverage and it doesn't make sense to take two papers in the morning
sw04200-B_007198-008598 taking the journal in the afternoon means you're get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven AM or noon uh which you wouldn't get uh until the next day with the Constitution
sw04200-B_009250-009476 well New York Times
sw04200-B_009476-009680 and uh so
sw04200-B_009680-009720 [noise]
sw04200-B_009720-011149 it's kind of strange they they're they're they're generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the New York Times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the New York Times
sw04200-B_011149-011298 so it's
sw04200-B_011298-011601 uh they tend to be really
sw04200-B_011601-011849 uh really liberal
sw04200-B_011849-013182 uh and i- i- i actually think probably uncharacteristic for Gwinnete County but it it's still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues
sw04200-B_013950-015276 well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics
sw04200-B_015276-015724 i'm you know active in politics and uh uh
sw04200-B_015827-016599 well i ran for State Representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for State Labor Commission this year
sw04200-B_016599-016873 kind of ambitious but [laughter]
sw04200-B_017098-018425 well i um i- i was i run as a Libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race
sw04200-B_018847-019472 well i hope so the way [laughter] that's becoming pretty clear that the other two aren't doing that great of a job
sw04200-B_019598-019849 so where do you get your news
sw04200-B_020377-020528 uh-huh
sw04200-B_021349-021498 uh-huh
sw04200-B_021820-021949 yeah
sw04200-B_021949-022275 yeah i subscribe to several magazines too
sw04200-B_022898-023022 um-hum
sw04200-B_023299-023836 i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh
sw04200-B_023836-024850 where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now i've got four kids and a fifth on the way now and it's hard to find time to read as much as i did
sw04200-B_024850-025427 so i've cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four
sw04200-B_025427-026900 things like uh uh Reason which a lot of people don't even they don't even know what it is it's a it's a Libertarian magazine but it's uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature
sw04200-B_026900-028326 and uh the Freeman which is another uh Libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing
sw04200-B_028326-029274 and uh oh a couple of others but uh i don't tend t[o]- to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that
sw04200-B_029550-029795 yeah i work for uh uh
sw04201-A_000000-000227 [noise] what kind of car are you driving now
sw04201-A_000426-000699 uh-huh do you like that one
sw04201-A_000801-000948 uh-huh
sw04201-A_001571-001798 how long have you had it
sw04201-A_001798-002398 uh-huh my car that was the main problem i've ever had with it is
sw04201-A_002398-003370 i guess twice i've had to get the valve cover gasket replaced and once the gasket around the the um oil pan
sw04201-A_003370-003849 it's uh nineteen [laughter-eighty] [laughter-two] Cutlass Sierra
sw04201-A_003849-004300 and it still drives pretty well though i had kind of low mileage on it
sw04201-A_004900-005248 wow that's a lot of driving
sw04201-A_006099-006947 uh-huh i think that um i might've done better to get a pickup for the use that i've put mine to
sw04201-A_006947-007548 but um i didn't get it i didn't get that i got a car and that's
sw04201-A_007548-008446 there have been times when i was glad to have a car but most of the stuff i've done has been hauling around and i've been better off to have a pickup
sw04201-A_009098-009349 a full size pickup
sw04201-A_009748-009899 um-hum
sw04201-A_010224-010947 right what do you think you'll get a um step side or a a smooth split side
sw04201-A_011053-012031 yeah my daddy use used to always get a step side and because he has cows and the cows he can
sw04201-A_012031-012627 with a step side you can haul cows in the back because_1 there aren't those humps for the tires
sw04201-A_012627-012800 but
sw04201-A_012800-013823 this last time he decided to still get a step side even though he couldn't find a step side in the long full length they only had them_1 in the short length
sw04201-A_014100-015279 so he was disappointed in that but he still went with the step side because he thought it was easier to get in and around it and take things off the truck and so on without always having to come out the back
sw04201-A_015279-015947 but he uses it on the farm and he built himself a cow trailer so it he didn't need the length so much anymore
sw04201-A_017098-017597 do you just use it for your own purposes and hauling your family around
sw04201-A_019346-020148 right do you have if you're going to go camping are you going to have to drive you car to take your family camping plus drive the truck
sw04201-A_020999-021198 right
sw04201-A_021949-023047 well even though i could've probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring that'll be more useful in the future
sw04201-A_023047-023248 so
sw04201-A_023248-023699 i don't know i'll probably look for something that has a
sw04201-A_023699-024025 dealer everywhere i would like to [laughter-drive]
sw04201-A_024175-024478 that'll be the main criterion
sw04201-A_024478-025298 i guess the Japanese makes though do are starting to have dealers all over though i don't know about_1 how the Hyundai dealer network is
sw04201-A_025871-026024 um-hum
sw04201-A_027247-027602 that's true that's a good point i remember
sw04201-A_027698-028500 a long time ago my folks got a Chrysler but the nearest Chry[sler]- Chrysler dealer to them_1 was over fifty miles away
sw04201-A_028500-029028 and it weren't all that good of a car they had pretty many trouble with it
sw04201-A_029028-029598 pretty much trouble so whenever it would break down and take it back to the dealer they'd have to
sw04201-A_029598-029808 to nurse it along
sw04201-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04201-B_000099-000597 no i'm well driving a Hyundai Sonata
sw04201-B_000597-000850 no we like it real well
sw04201-B_000949-001600 yeah we haven't had the only problem we've had is the valve cover gasket leaking other than that it's been working real good
sw04201-B_001699-001898 uh two years
sw04201-B_003300-003450 um-hum
sw04201-B_004198-004996 yeah well this um like i said we've had this for two years and it almost got forty five thousand on it
sw04201-B_005098-005873 yeah wife does a lot of driving [noise] she she uses it a lot and then we have the second vehicle the
sw04201-B_005873-006127 Nissan pickup
sw04201-B_006827-007050 [laughter]
sw04201-B_008328-008500 yeah
sw04201-B_008500-009226 well our next vehicle is going to be a a full size truck well we're kind of getting little
sw04201-B_009226-009826 yeah uh Nissan is just a a mini truck
sw04201-B_009826-010348 and it's not real big for a family so [laughter]
sw04201-B_010798-011199 i'll probably get a fleet side
sw04201-B_012499-012746 yeah
sw04201-B_013776-014098 yeah that's that's all they make them_1 in now i think
sw04201-B_014098-015249 [noise]
sw04201-B_015249-015398 yeah
sw04201-B_015850-016048 yeah
sw04201-B_016048-017148 yeah yeah like i say like i'm we're kind of moving out in a mini truck and into the full size will be the next one so
sw04201-B_017447-018226 oh yeah plus you know i help friends move here and there and stuff and we kind of
sw04201-B_018226-019449 getting to the point where it's it's we're going to do a lot of camping and stuff during the summertime and the mini truck just doesn't [laughter] work very well so
sw04201-B_020028-020298 oh no no um
sw04201-B_020298-020448 the
sw04201-B_020448-021101 what we'd probably do right now is just use the car and try to put everything in it that we can
sw04201-B_021101-021449 and then later on we're going to try to get a uh
sw04201-B_021449-021649 camper trailer
sw04201-B_021649-021899 once we buy a new truck
sw04201-B_022849-022973 yeah
sw04201-B_023326-023499 [noise]
sw04201-B_023925-024269 [laughter] oh yeah i can understand that
sw04201-B_024377-024548 yeah
sw04201-B_025200-025946 well its pretty good uh we had one and then he closed and now we got another one here right near us so
sw04201-B_025946-027300 it's it's all right uh like i said the only problem we really had with our car just a valve cover gasket leaking and since they fixed it under warranty it was we haven't had any problem with it
sw04201-B_028427-028599 yeah
sw04201-B_029000-029130 um-hum
sw04202-A_000000-000442 [noise] -[w]ell Doug what are they doing in your community in Pennsylvania about recycling
sw04202-A_000929-001095 uh-huh
sw04202-A_002894-003048 uh-huh
sw04202-A_003048-003435 so the the people have to separate it out is that
sw04202-A_004503-004673 oh
sw04202-A_005294-005453 yeah
sw04202-A_005453-006045 how about_1 at Penn State do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing
sw04202-A_007987-008209 oh yeah
sw04202-A_008669-008752 oh
sw04202-A_009288-010000 well what i've uh learned about recycling is that it's almost impractical to recycle newspapers
sw04202-A_010000-010156 which is sad
sw04202-A_010156-011275 and and as a matter of fact i'm member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of Dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand
sw04202-A_011275-011594 the supply is there people are willing to do it
sw04202-A_011594-012455 but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of [vocalized-noise] used newspapers effective[ly]- cost effectively
sw04202-A_012455-012667 then it's not gonna happen
sw04202-A_012667-013366 and and there are whole huge warehouses in Dallas full of used newspapers
sw04202-A_013366-014053 and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in Texas where they can strip the ink off
sw04202-A_014053-014742 i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said
sw04202-A_014742-015485 uh the city of Plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um
sw04202-A_015485-016006 glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too
sw04202-A_016006-016931 and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood [laughter-yet] but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh
sw04202-A_016931-017573 they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash
sw04202-A_017746-018708 yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you don't want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper
sw04202-A_018708-018947 which you can buy from the city
sw04202-A_018947-019405 and and they're great until it rains and then they start [laughter-biodegrading]
sw04202-A_019547-020138 but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch
sw04202-A_020138-021462 and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter [laughter]
sw04202-A_021462-021593 [laughter]
sw04202-A_021593-021689 but
sw04202-A_021689-021884 it's uh
sw04202-A_021884-023058 uh since they won't take any yard waste it's that's in plastic bags it's a little bit annoying when you're you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing
sw04202-A_023058-024177 and you don't have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you haven't bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves [laughter]
sw04202-A_024177-024314 [laughter]
sw04202-A_024314-025113 but uh i don't know i th[is]- for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community
sw04202-A_025699-025936 um [vocalized-noise]
sw04202-A_025936-027215 i don't know about statewide i think i think in the Dallas area there are few other uh suburbs Plano's a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling
sw04202-A_027215-028419 but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled
sw04202-A_028704-028871 i mean
sw04202-B_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04202-B_000251-000389 okay
sw04202-B_000389-000708 well some stuff
sw04202-B_000708-001765 i go to Penn State up here and the town recycles quite a bit actually they collect curbside
sw04202-B_001765-002111 gone the day that the garbage goes
sw04202-B_002111-003011 and they recycle um tin and aluminum cans and glass and newspaper basically
sw04202-B_003383-003549 um
sw04202-B_003549-004132 no actually the um garbage crew does that you just put a
sw04202-B_004132-005308 you know p[lastic]- plastic recycling bin out on the curb every week and now except for having the paper bundled people don't really separate at all
sw04202-B_005885-006718 um yeah they do although there's just recently been a problem with them
sw04202-B_006718-007419 uh like saying that they weren't able to afford recycling everything anymore
sw04202-B_007419-008075 so that they um they stopped recycling newspaper on campus for instance
sw04202-B_008075-008649 they stopped recycling glass so they're only doing cans and white paper now
sw04202-B_008649-008940 which i think is kind of insane
sw04202-B_008940-009318 because it's really not that expensive
sw04202-B_009984-010180 um-hum
sw04202-B_010836-011055 yeah
sw04202-B_011217-011355 um-hum

sw04202-B_027846-027997 right
sw04202-B_028318-028556 ri[ght]- right because_1
sw04202-B_028742-029952 right the plan o[f]- the state college originally was that the recycling would pay for itself and all that and the people's garbage rates would actually go down and of course if hasn't happened that way
sw04203-A_000000-000037 [noise]
sw04203-A_000037-000224 so John um [noise]

sw04203-A_005508-005814 [noise] couple of things though that i did think of there where um

sw04203-B_001133-001997 [vocalized-noise] keeping records of everything that's sadistic on me i consider that to be an invasion of privacy privacy and i find that it's
sw04203-B_001997-002651 i guess not not to the extreme of wanting to to to drop out of society and not have credit cards and not have
sw04203-B_002651-003551 uh you know cars or cre[dit]- credit cards or anything uh uh i deal with it but i do considered that it has it's uh potential

sw04203-B_011369-012752 [vocalized-noise] for all we know we don't know what's on what's on their data base before all we know when actually ca[ll]- uh call in to check on us uh there may be a little print out says that uh arrested seven times convicted none
sw04203-B_012752-013464 i mean there maybe maybe that kind of detail involved [noise] he may be called upon it may uh the next
sw04203-B_013464-014009 the next move is to have terminals in their in their uh cars
sw04203-B_014121-014412 i know well i'm just saying uh universal
sw04203-B_014412-014554 i mean that
sw04203-B_014554-015661 that and and i well i in fact actually i consider radar detection to be sort of an invasion [laughter] i think that that uh we have uh entirely to much uh
sw04203-B_015661-015908 regulation i think that
sw04203-B_016151-017493 if you take the old philosophy of you know when you when you catch him you convict him that's a healthy philosophy then well we know that you are going to do it so were going to watch you all the time [laughter]
sw04203-B_017740-019075 well the thing is that even though [laughter] even though i will probably do that even though i am guilty uh if someone uses uh uh human judgement instead of just making the rules they find out that
sw04203-B_019075-019250 i don't [vocalized-noise]
sw04203-B_019250-019417 put any risk
sw04203-B_019417-019939 to other people in certainly not any any risk comparable to
sw04203-B_019939-020596 oh let's say granny out on Sunday driving forty five and pulling into my lane when i'm beside her
sw04203-B_020596-020734 uh
sw04203-B_020734-021372 i could drive a hundred and ten and be safer than most of Sunday drivers on their
sw04203-B_021372-022076 i mean i mean a hundred and ten relative to everybody driving fifty five that's how that's how bad of drivers are out there now that have license
sw04203-B_022076-022793 it's the other [vocalized-noise] uh problem of privacy i- i- i think uh i think that uh
sw04203-B_022793-023212 company's intend uh tend to have to much
sw04203-B_023212-023556 uh they want to know to much about you
sw04203-B_023556-023856 and i really think they are only right
sw04203-B_023856-024013 is
sw04203-B_024013-024275 weather or not i do my job [laughter]
sw04203-B_025701-025826 um-hum
sw04203-B_026298-026693 that yeah that that has been the present philosophy
sw04203-B_026693-027259 uh i think something that kind of bother me that this is not a pri[vacy]- i don't think this is a privacy issue but i'm not sure
sw04203-B_027259-027817 uh i don't like morals uh people's uh
sw04203-B_027817-028149 i guess i should call it Southern Baptist morals [laughter]
sw04203-B_028149-028745 that determine whether or not someone can go to a club
sw04203-B_028745-029202 weather it it not that it's legal or not legal anymore now its
sw04203-B_029202-029339 uh
sw04203-B_029339-029757 and i- i give the the example is news club says that they just
sw04203-B_029757-029952 regulated by not allowing them
sw04204-A_000000-000118 [noise]
sw04204-A_000118-001024 well actually not but i'm all ways looking at them_1 [laughter] you know you yeah yeah it uh
sw04204-A_001024-001182 uh-huh
sw04204-A_001520-001618 hum
sw04204-A_001618-002242 you know am convince that um it's always cheaper to repair than replace
sw04204-A_002242-002635 and uh you know if you replace there are other reasons for doing it
sw04204-A_002635-003682 like you want you know m[y]- my answer to a car is it's okay if it ugly um it ok[ay]- depending on the [vocalized-noise] there is a they're bunch of other things that okay that it is it got to be reliable there is no excuse for that
sw04204-A_003778-003963 [laughter]
sw04204-A_004075-004230 yeah yeah
sw04204-A_004230-005084 um-hum well safety is subjective i think um you know one person criteria of safety is maybe a little different from another person
sw04204-A_005084-005230 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-A_005661-006187 well the you know not reliable company it it will never start in which case extremely safe [laughter]
sw04204-A_006187-006358 [laughter]
sw04204-A_006619-007133 yeah that's true there are places where you can starve or freeze to death if your car want start
sw04204-A_007133-008132 um for a while i was a proponent of Saab's and um i have had two of them and one was a tremendous one disappointment from a reliability view point
sw04204-A_008132-008331 and um
sw04204-A_008331-008712 basically i decided to get rid of it before the warranty ran out
sw04204-A_008712-009089 and i think i was cured of the European motoring mystic
sw04204-A_009089-009225 at that point
sw04204-A_010129-010357 um have you own one or
sw04204-A_010357-010530 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-A_010530-010678 guess i'm
sw04204-A_010678-011013 [noise]
sw04204-A_011013-012347 you know if it weren't for the reliability in every other respect the car was wonderful drove great ton of room very very safe but front wheel drive which with me a plus but i just kept having um string of minor malfunctions
sw04204-A_012347-013507 and um just the process of have to pay for these thing you know also now they increment is what hundred and fifty dollars two hundred fifty dollars every time you take it to a mechanic and touch it hundred dollars hundred doll[ars]- hundred dollars [laughter]
sw04204-A_013507-013704 [laughter]
sw04204-A_013943-014437 yeah its can of funny because_1 um i was having it repaired at this place called Import Only
sw04204-A_014437-014823 and um this guy's comment was
sw04204-A_014823-015464 and i asked him you know you you repair them_1 all what do you think is [laughter-best] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] reliability and he kind of get a Japanese car
sw04204-A_015464-015871 um that starting to fall out of fashion these days [laughter]
sw04204-A_016036-016113 uh
sw04204-A_016312-017222 yeah you know i'm convince that well you it kind of interesting is what i'm driving right now is a Ford Probe which is manufactured in a Mazda factory in Illinois
sw04204-A_017222-017594 so i'm not sure whether it's an importer [laughter-or] [laughter-not]
sw04204-A_017594-017769 [laughter]
sw04204-A_018223-018689 yeah it's fake it's fake because_1 see i mean even if i i'm sure the um
sw04204-A_018807-019482 you know if you take the most Americanized in American cars and you know pry open one of those computer you will find a computer chip that were assemble in Singapore
sw04204-A_019482-019906 and so forth uh it's just diff[icult]- difficult
sw04204-A_019906-020264 i mean it's got funny [vocalized-noise] coming once just before and um
sw04204-A_020433-020971 equal the orange juice was label concentrate manufactured in the United States and Turkey
sw04204-A_021091-021483 who would have though of it apple say ora[nge]- apple apple juice and turkey
sw04204-A_021483-021584 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-A_022014-022993 [laughter] very probably you know its um yeah i think the ideal of um yeah its interesting because you know the location um
sw04204-A_022993-023661 don't seem to uh you know y[ou]- you can work over several thousands of miles not like it once was
sw04204-A_023661-024201 [vocalized-noise] use use to be they req[uest]- uh penalty for [vocalized-noise] doing it but i don't think it's true any more
sw04204-A_024311-024434 and so
sw04204-A_024569-025475 yeah absolutely um you know but there may be other bigger factors so if you decide to replace this ten year old vehicle what is the prime contender right know
sw04204-A_026015-026282 yeah i own one [laughter]
sw04204-A_026282-026416 yeah
sw04204-A_026416-026704 yeah
sw04204-A_026704-026883 um which kind
sw04204-A_027043-027134 uh-huh
sw04204-A_027272-027366 yeah
sw04204-A_027518-027755 uh you would like the Saab have you driven one
sw04204-A_027966-028076 um-hum
sw04204-A_028076-028236 yeah
sw04204-A_028236-028758 well i had had a nine hundred which i replaced the nine thousand nine thousands is the one that gave me a lot of trouble
sw04204-A_028758-028876 um
sw04204-A_028876-029596 i happen the think the nine hundreds is a uh i like the nine hundred better it it had more of the Saab weirdness which really attracted me [laughter]
sw04204-A_029717-029842 yeah
sw04204-A_029842-029991 um you know it's um
sw04204-B_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04204-B_000024-000188 so you're looking for a car
sw04204-B_000457-000750 [laughter] yeah i know that feeling
sw04204-B_000855-001394 mines about ten years old now so debating weather to run it into the ground
sw04204-B_001394-001712 put up with those headache or get something new
sw04204-B_002617-002706 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-B_003613-004099 right that's number one well that and safety
sw04204-B_004099-004302 safe and reliable
sw04204-B_005064-005722 well i think yeah that's true but reliabi[lity]- you know if it's not reliable it's not safe
sw04204-B_006068-006664 [laughter] well may be not if you're on the Trans Alaska highway
sw04204-B_008697-008852 uh
sw04204-B_009188-010207 well the Saab does have a lot of good features and the reliability is uh like one of the few things i worry about with Saab
sw04204-B_010207-011009 no i haven't but uh you know lo[ok]- you know looking around it does seem like a roomy
sw04204-B_011009-011222 [vocalized-noise] good handling
sw04204-B_011400-011571 yeah exactly
sw04204-B_012291-012427 yeah
sw04204-B_013198-013360 oh yeah
sw04204-B_013360-013492 well that's
sw04204-B_013594-014023 yeah that's the other drawback of Saab is that they are not really cheap
sw04204-B_015947-016376 oh yeah a lot of uh flag waving going on
sw04204-B_017187-017360 [laughter]
sw04204-B_017661-018335 well that's a serious problem if your concerned with that i don't think its possible to tell where things are built anyone
sw04204-B_019617-019853 oh yeah you know
sw04204-B_021455-022096 yeah its probably own by a European cou[ntry]- company that's employing Mexicans
sw04204-B_022245-022400 y[ou]- you know
sw04204-B_023700-023880 yeah it seems like a
sw04204-B_024297-024645 oh well transportation does still cost
sw04204-B_025474-026028 well uh i was i was actually thinking of the Saab nine thousands
sw04204-B_026028-026396 but there's a there's a few other hatchbacks
sw04204-B_026396-026838 no well i have it a Toyota and i like the Toyota's
sw04204-B_026838-027089 it's a a Supra
sw04204-B_027089-027571 so it handles really well so i'm reluctant to get anything that handles poorly
sw04204-B_027709-028164 um i drove a nine hundred about five y[ears]- years ago
sw04204-B_028164-028306 it was very nice
sw04204-B_028702-028858 uh
sw04204-B_029623-029878 yes uh i don't mind ugly
sw04204-B_029878-029991 in fact i really don't
sw04205-A_000000-000257 what are your views Mister [vocalized-noise]
sw04205-A_002535-003186 well i'm just not really still not really sure why the war started
sw04205-A_003186-004406 uh there was a conflict with the Vietnamese had conflict with the French i- [noise] i know that and they've been in a war like state for seems like most of
sw04205-A_004406-004977 the time that their countries been prospering so they're just award tarnation
sw04205-A_005670-005798 uh-huh
sw04205-A_006354-006477 uh-huh
sw04205-A_006846-006968 uh-huh
sw04205-A_009553-010612 does oil come into the equation all of that is there oil in that area see oil is a a motivating factor for most of the
sw04205-A_010612-010950 altercations that go on in the world
sw04205-A_011241-011390 exactly
sw04205-A_011979-012104 um-hum
sw04205-A_012940-013038 um-hum
sw04205-A_013426-013973 what about what do you think about strategic location just as
sw04205-A_013973-014255 if you think about it
sw04205-A_014255-015678 Russia has Cuba which is an island outside the United States and United States has Japan that's right out side of Cuba it it does Vietnam have a any strategic location
sw04205-A_016401-016528 um-hum
sw04205-A_018381-018514 um-hum
sw04205-A_019306-019418 um-hum
sw04205-A_019951-020075 uh-huh
sw04205-A_020460-021022 i sort of believe that the Vietnam because of the Vietnam war and the
sw04205-A_021022-021899 the way that the United States exited from it that that has brought on other scrimmages and i- i thinks that that's
sw04205-A_021899-022153 some what related
sw04205-A_022153-022284 to the
sw04205-A_022284-022524 Gulf War because
sw04205-A_022524-022949 it makes the American people keep safe face
sw04205-A_025207-025358 um-hum
sw04205-A_026709-026848 um-hum
sw04205-A_027210-027329 from
sw04205-A_027329-027446 um-hum
sw04205-A_027624-027975 um-hum is this is this something in your
sw04205-A_027975-028968 in your m[ilitary]- in your military training that that uh suggests that that is [vocalized-noise] a um procedure of the
sw04205-A_028968-029299 [noise] of the American way of war
sw04205-A_029563-029863 right is there you know like there
sw04205-B_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04205-B_000258-000598 uh [noise] i think Vietnam war
sw04205-B_000712-000906 was justified
sw04205-B_000906-001124 but it was carried out badly
sw04205-B_001124-001402 unfortunately politician got a hold of it
sw04205-B_001402-001734 and it was a military victory but it was uh
sw04205-B_001734-002128 i'd say uh a political defeat
sw04205-B_002128-002502 wh[at]- wh[at]- what do you think about of world i mean the Vietnam War
sw04205-B_004925-005255 [noise] no uh from what i remember was uh
sw04205-B_005255-005401 the French
sw04205-B_005401-005687 had a Vietnam as a colony
sw04205-B_005687-005973 and then after the war World War II
sw04205-B_005973-006072 uh
sw04205-B_006072-006409 Vietnam wanted to become independent o[f]- of France
sw04205-B_006409-006663 so they started an up rising and that was the French
sw04205-B_006663-006894 and oh Chinese War
sw04205-B_006894-007158 and and uh basically
sw04205-B_007158-007842 V[ietnamese]- Vietnamese where beating the French so we took over because_1 we had our containment policy
sw04205-B_007842-008145 and uh the north side of Vietnam
sw04205-B_008145-008402 went to Russia for military aid
sw04205-B_008402-008545 and so [noise] we didn't want
sw04205-B_008702-009113 so we didn't want [noise] Vietnam [noise] become communist
sw04205-B_009113-009584 so that's why we started supporting the South Viet[namese]- Vietnamese that's how the war started
sw04205-B_010010-010225 uh
sw04205-B_010858-011580 but it's not necessarily oil i- i- i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i don't think they had that much of a natural
sw04205-B_011580-012304 to much natural resource it's just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didn't help the South Vietnamese
sw04205-B_012304-012990 the North Vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko
sw04205-B_012990-013290 so we didn't want that so we got into the war
sw04205-B_014674-014795 uh-huh
sw04205-B_015663-015825 uh [noise]
sw04205-B_015944-016229 actually i- i- i really haven't considered that much
sw04205-B_016229-016438 about a strategic location
sw04205-B_016607-016765 hum uh
sw04205-B_016904-017204 other than it being another country falling to the
sw04205-B_017204-017384 to pinkos or the communist
sw04205-B_017496-017695 no not to much real strategic
sw04205-B_017695-017825 location
sw04205-B_017825-017976 it's just
sw04205-B_017976-018749 uh for for Russia to continue it has to expand if it doesn't expand it'll collapse
sw04205-B_018749-019033 so by doing our containment policy
sw04205-B_019033-019232 we're defeating
sw04205-B_019232-019338 Russia
sw04205-B_019466-020018 i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best
sw04205-B_020018-020131 but
sw04205-B_020131-020393 that was our our little view then
sw04205-B_022942-023137 uh
sw04205-B_023266-023669 i- i- i agree partial with you the Vietnam War made us loose
sw04205-B_023669-023967 loose faith uh politically
sw04205-B_023967-024301 and and th[at]- and and to the fact that the American public
sw04205-B_024301-024544 can't stomach war or high causality
sw04205-B_024544-025302 so we aren't really steadfast in that regard but military we un[questionably]- you know unquestionably quick ass in Vietnam
sw04205-B_025401-025499 uh
sw04205-B_025624-025796 [noise] it might have had
sw04205-B_025796-026249 probably did have some re[percussions]- repercussions towards now you know people do
sw04205-B_026359-026775 the enemy does know if the America takes high causality it will leave
sw04205-B_026775-026947 just like in uh
sw04205-B_027084-027675 uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out
sw04205-B_029290-029653 uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities
sw04206-A_000000-000194 how do you fill about drugs testing
sw04206-A_000810-000939 um-hum
sw04206-A_002155-002277 um-hum
sw04206-A_002508-002632 yeah
sw04206-A_003462-003567 um-hum
sw04206-A_004522-004781 well yeah i'm i'm more of the uh
sw04206-A_004781-005628 i'm kind of more against it than i am for it i- i think that people i think people should more be they should be judge on you know their performance and i
sw04206-A_005628-005889 i guess it kind of seems to me that's it kind of a
sw04206-A_005889-006045 you know
sw04206-A_006045-006673 the pos[itive]- you the test type thing that you know people should pay attention to how there employees are you know the supervisors
sw04206-A_006673-007247 should keep an eye on them i- i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum
sw04206-A_007985-008143 and
sw04206-A_008143-008446 it also kind of i mean
sw04206-A_008446-009047 i don't know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like it's um
sw04206-A_009047-009271 it's kind of a personal you know your
sw04206-A_009271-010052 checking you know your body and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can
sw04206-A_010052-010426 y[ou]- you know ge[t]- get away with testing other things yeah exactly
sw04206-A_010601-010698 yeah
sw04206-A_010853-011101 i mean that's a drug as well it's [laughter-just] [laughter]
sw04206-A_011548-011644 uh-huh
sw04206-A_011759-011863 -[th]at's true
sw04206-A_012734-013551 uh-huh well right now with a with air line pilots and stuff i i now my stepfather works for Northwest Airlines and they had a
sw04206-A_013551-014185 a thing a a while back and he knew one of the guys that got in trouble for i guess he had gone out the night before

sw04206-A_014297-014661 ha[d]- had to much to drink and you are not suppose to drink within
sw04206-A_014661-015102 i think i think it's like twelve hours or twenty fou[r]- i know there's a certain
sw04206-A_015102-015674 yeah before before they get back on the job and and he had bee[n]- been within that time period
sw04206-A_015674-015813 and

sw04206-A_016318-016383 [vocalized-noise]
sw04206-A_016611-016693 yeah
sw04206-A_016983-017515 yeah it just change it vary so much from per[son]- person to person is [vocalized-noise] it's a subjective type thing
sw04206-A_018791-018938 you never know
sw04206-A_018938-019367 um-hum
sw04206-A_019367-019732 and it it seems th[ere]- there are a lot of profession now it seems like
sw04206-A_019732-020344 um you know am sure the president of the United States doesn't get drug tested but he's got a lot of responsibilities and
sw04206-A_020344-020726 uh as as seems like you know some things
sw04206-A_020726-020912 if there are going to do it
sw04206-A_020912-021124 you know like i know a lot of government
sw04206-A_021124-021294 um jobs are
sw04206-A_021294-021551 [vocalized-noise] require drug testing
sw04206-A_021551-021740 [vocalized-noise] you know
sw04206-A_021740-021963 it seems like they should uh not
sw04206-A_022117-022436 be you know they should not be hypocritical about it
sw04206-A_023204-023532 [laughter] they having such a big problem with the
sw04206-A_023532-023780 the drug war anyway its
sw04206-A_024133-024202 yeah
sw04206-A_024572-024665 uh-huh

sw04206-A_026229-026781 i mean some people are working with some kind of classified information but non of that i [noise] think
sw04206-A_026781-027280 but uh they don't require any type of testing there and i re[member]- i was in uh
sw04206-A_027280-027995 i was in the Air Force for uh a little while and they had a random type thing going
sw04206-A_027995-028771 so every i mean every i mean i'm a rejoining basic trainer or [vocalized-noise]
sw04206-A_028771-029083 just one mourning like every one from you know this
sw04206-A_029083-029358 flight or what every would be tested [vocalized-noise]
sw04206-A_029358-029561 it's kind of a random thing
sw04206-A_029561-029763 but then i know of some other jobs
sw04206-B_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04206-B_000061-000527 will i'm sorry i ha[ve]- i had mixed fillings about it um
sw04206-B_000527-000992 at originally i thought all man i'm all for it totally then you know and then um
sw04206-B_000992-001426 uh aft[er]- i got to thinking about it after it's been around a while now i think well it's there's
sw04206-B_001426-001591 you know uh
sw04206-B_001591-002714 maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know
sw04206-B_002714-003722 i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think that's a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldn't mind taking it
sw04206-B_003722-004695 but i do also believe there are times when um you you can come out on the bad end of the stick you know uh because of it
sw04206-B_005015-005179 yeah yeah
sw04206-B_005566-005680 sure
sw04206-B_006016-006176 yeah
sw04206-B_006560-006753 that's right that's right and then
sw04206-B_006958-008202 yeah well i agree with that to i mean if you can if there is a reason you might think you need to check them maybe so but um if there doing good performance if i had a good record yeah that's a good point you know wh[y]- why should you
sw04206-B_008202-008334 you know
sw04206-B_009244-009424 yeah sure
sw04206-B_009424-009672 that's right that's right and um
sw04206-B_009991-011000 really really where what's the next step you know yeah and uh cause myself i drink and uh you i'm i'm sure that you know when will they
sw04206-B_011000-012150 that's true that's true and what's what's really the difference there alcohol is worst than a lot of drugs that they might uh consider illegal you know [laughter] and um but they um uh
sw04206-B_012150-013049 i mean i know in alcohol i mean if you if you drink the night before and what if you have the test the next day maybe that will be the next step is alcohol testing you know breath analyzers or [laughter-something]
sw04206-B_013416-013598 yeah yeah
sw04206-B_014164-014345 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04206-B_014905-015179 uh-huh before they go a back on there jobs
sw04206-B_015296-015436 yeah right
sw04206-B_015605-015700 yeah
sw04206-B_015700-015943 yeah that's that's that's yeah i know it's
sw04206-B_016118-017010 [vocalized-noise] i'm sure he did and he was probably perfectly capable you there was nothing at all that he couldn't have done you know as far as his job
sw04206-B_017010-017110 you know
sw04206-B_017255-017457 that's true that's true
sw04206-B_017457-018818 yeah and uh i mean i never thought about it but you know you may drink and uh drink a hole lot one night and you may be going out going somewhere the next day like Sunday afternoon and y[ou]- you be perfectly fine all over again and uh if they did a test on you you might not pass
sw04206-B_018818-019413 you know just just from the night before and um you know that's that's sort like the drugs testing you know
sw04206-B_020252-020402 that's right yeah
sw04206-B_020714-020834 yeah
sw04206-B_021290-021601 yeah that's that's true yeah that's true
sw04206-B_022004-022188 right i know what you are saying
sw04206-B_022320-023293 that's right if you know um if you know if they're going to do it just do it totally nation wide every job there is you know or or else you know just don't do it [laughter]
sw04206-B_023293-023495 i mean it makes good sense
sw04206-B_023708-024104 yeah really i mean that's where the real problem is
sw04206-B_024104-024953 i me[an]- um but where i work uh i think they have talked about it you know and uh but nothing like that has come up at all you know
sw04206-B_025265-025354 yeah
sw04206-B_025354-025439 uh-huh
sw04206-B_025795-025952 yeah yeah
sw04206-B_026512-026655 right right
sw04206-B_027068-027178 yeah yeah
sw04206-B_027643-027779 yeah yeah
sw04206-B_027961-028100 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04206-B_028100-028563 [noise]
sw04206-B_028563-028706 right right
sw04206-B_029331-029444 sure sure
sw04206-B_029557-029650 right right
sw04207-A_000000-000918 [noise] uh actually it took me quite a while to get someone uh about six minutes so i have had some time to think about this and you know what is been done and what's could be done and what should be done
sw04207-A_000918-001045 um
sw04207-A_001045-001741 i think up to this point and time the problem with uh recollection or waste what ever
sw04207-A_001741-002435 is that it is sort of on a voluntary uh bases where you know you have to actually [vocalized-noise] except
sw04207-A_002435-002929 personal effort to make it happen you know like take your papers to the
sw04207-A_002929-003839 uh recycling center you take this uh one place or another and um in Portola Valley where i live
sw04207-A_003839-004470 the i guess [vocalized-noise] i use [vocalized-noise] garbage company i don't know what they do in Mountain View but uh
sw04207-A_004470-005128 uh they have a program that uh they send a truck through
sw04207-A_005128-005558 basically you don't have to do anything all you have to do is to put your papers
sw04207-A_005558-006739 uh out put your bottle out in a bag put your paper out in a bad and they do the recollection for you basically they come by in a cycle quite a bit like garbage pick-up
sw04207-A_006739-007054 um and in fact
sw04207-A_007457-007593 [noise]
sw04207-A_009304-009426 [noise]
sw04207-A_009426-009579 i see
sw04207-A_009860-010010 oh okay
sw04207-A_011746-012338 [laughter] the garbage is [vocalized-noise] inspected
sw04207-A_012338-012676 [laughter]
sw04207-A_012676-012784 [noise]
sw04207-A_012902-013080 oh that's interesting
sw04207-A_013953-015318 well i think the only way to make it really successful is to make it as easy as possible for people and and i think that uh practice here uh you know i lived previously in Dallas up to uh a year or so ago practice here of
sw04207-A_015318-015831 sort of making it an automated part of garbage pick-up uh seems to be a step forward
sw04207-A_017757-019254 [noise] well my sister-in-law lives in northern Wisconsin and they have a financial system there actually i can't recall exactly what it is but you have uh sort of a free pick up of sorted garbage if you sort it and and it's actually pretty tedious
sw04207-A_019254-020434 [laughter] sorted not sorted free pick-up the uh free pick-up of sorted garbage uh but y[ou]- its actually pretty [vocalized-noise]
sw04207-A_020434-021667 nitpicking how you have to sort it uh and for sorted garbage uh indiscriminate garbage there is a fee oh a rather exorbitant fee
sw04207-A_021667-021794 uh
sw04207-A_021921-022914 well uh uh uh it i guess in it this is also a subject inspection as you well mention but uh i a it's basically on an all name basis if you this the [vocalized-noise]
sw04207-A_022914-024012 uh sorted stuff that you put out is uh quite a healthy fee for for picking that up and i think it's free or something like that for the stuff that is sorted
sw04207-A_026285-026447 [noise]
sw04207-A_026447-026643 hum um-hum
sw04207-A_027810-027936 right
sw04207-A_029085-029189 yeah
sw04207-A_029542-029853 yeah it would be nice if we had a continuing cycle here where every
sw04207-B_000000-000070 [noise]
sw04207-B_000070-000205 [noise]
sw04207-B_002642-002779 um-hum
sw04207-B_004378-004541 yeah we have our own
sw04207-B_006899-008392 [noise] yeah that that that also what they do here in Mountain View in fact there is um uh for each area like for our area there is a person who's a recycling block leader where i don't know if it's that way were you are where they put up a sign
sw04207-B_008392-008778 um telling people in the community that it's uh
sw04207-B_008778-009952 the recycling day coming up the next day so that people are aware of it and so people are it's a reminder to tell people to do that and yeah where even uh official recycling block black liters of
sw04207-B_009952-010570 for our area the oth[er]- i know some people living in New Jersey and they said that where they live
sw04207-B_010570-011755 um its mandatory that you do recycling and if the garbage people and i don't know how thoroughly they they check this but if they find certain essentially contra banned um [noise]
sw04207-B_011755-012200 things in your [laughter] uh [laughter]
sw04207-B_012200-012997 yeah basic basically your garbage is [laughter-being] inspected if they find certain contraband [laughter-things] [laughter-in] [laughter-there] you can be fined for it [laughter] it
sw04207-B_012997-014078 yeah i th[ought]- i thought that was really amazing and it's uh it's sort of another way of uh uh encouraging or try new uh enforce that that type of um proper behavior
sw04207-B_015803-016293 yeah i think it i think it's true and i think that um
sw04207-B_016293-016867 do you think it would help if there were um financial incentives like
sw04207-B_016867-017862 you know were people bring the um uh there cans and um and you get a penny a can or something do you think those types of uh remediation are to
sw04207-B_019013-019158 [laughter]
sw04207-B_019158-019367 sorted or sorted [laughter]
sw04207-B_019367-019658 [laughter]
sw04207-B_019658-019953 [laughter] probably some of that to [laughter]
sw04207-B_021012-021157 um-hum
sw04207-B_021630-021893 oh really if you mix and match things improperly
sw04207-B_023509-023575 huh
sw04207-B_023990-024494 yeah around here also i'm in Mountain View and i presume in
sw04207-B_024494-025856 this whole area i expect that the kind of pick-up that that you have in Porta Valley and we have here are now very common uh at least in this area and we also have um uh day when there's um
sw04207-B_025856-026133 uh two days a year when there's hazardous waste
sw04207-B_026133-026847 um drop-offs were we've dropped off things like cans of paint that are in or garage and drop-off um other things
sw04207-B_026847-027716 uh and its a different sort of recycling but it's also uh very helpful to keep that stuff from going down the drain and into the water system and
sw04207-B_027716-028906 wherever else that goes and i don't know what they do with the one that happen seems like it's a uh significant problem for thing that you don't won't people to put down the drain and i don't i don't know if those go into landfills or
sw04207-B_028906-029054 i don't know
sw04207-B_029054-029454 landfills [noise] actually don't seem like a good solution either for them
sw04208-A_000000-000136 [noise] so what do you sell them_1 or what
sw04208-A_000305-000466 [laughter]
sw04208-A_001109-001216 [laughter]
sw04208-A_001216-001510 alright i've got a Mac in front of me as well
sw04208-A_001510-001704 yeah well i
sw04208-A_001704-002550 it's weird um where i came from they were all IBM oriented because i'm a doctoral student at UCF University of Central Florida
sw04208-A_002550-002672 and
sw04208-A_002672-003502 i IBM got to the campus first a long time ago and established themselves so i was real IBM format when i came up here to Minnesota
sw04208-A_003502-004223 but now up here everybody at Honeywell is Macintosh oriented or Sun or Silicon Graphics or what ever
sw04208-A_004347-004708 well i don't know y[es]- yes and no in a way
sw04208-A_004708-005174 i find almost that i am slower on graphical interface than i am on textural
sw04208-A_005805-005903 um-hum
sw04208-A_006228-006331 yeah
sw04208-A_006730-006860 right [vocalized-noise]
sw04208-A_007228-007369 so because
sw04208-A_007605-008290 [laughter] yeah that's true actually i'm i'm kind of interfa[cing]- interested in uh i'm a human factors person
sw04208-A_008290-008401 yeah
sw04208-A_008401-009139 yeah that's what my doctorate degree going to be in so i'm kind of inter[ested]- interested in the interface of the whole anyway you know but uh
sw04208-A_009271-009474 w[ho]- who do you work for
sw04208-A_009474-010324 well yeah yeah i hope so actually interfacing is not really my forte i'm more into uh aircraft displays and controls
sw04208-A_010324-011345 well yeah stuff like that generally i'm right now my dissertation is more into auditory display but uh you know things like beats and buzzers and tones and stuff
sw04208-A_011497-011673 uh yeah actually
sw04208-A_012194-012280 um-hum
sw04208-A_012404-012981 yeah yeah that that seems to be a pretty good pretty good thing as for as i can tell w[ho]- who do you work for in Rochester
sw04208-A_013254-013389 oh okay
sw04208-A_013867-013968 yeah
sw04208-A_013968-014116 [noise]
sw04208-A_014116-014533 [laughter] well not me [laughter]
sw04208-A_014918-015014 it would
sw04208-A_015126-015344 yeah i can say you know for me
sw04208-A_015344-016178 shoot in the last five or six years if i hadn't had access to a computer i would really be screwed in a big way [laughter] you know because_1 i've
sw04208-A_016178-017218 i had a i use to have a IBM compatible and i got my my thesis done and actually my master degree on it and now that i'm trying to work on my dissertation you know it just
sw04208-A_017218-017596 it's really good that i've got access to a Mac and stuff so
sw04208-A_017596-018171 yeah it's helped
sw04208-A_018171-018292 you bet
sw04208-A_018660-018750 yeah
sw04208-A_018750-019034 yeah you can build the fancy art work and stuff
sw04208-A_019034-019143 yeah
sw04208-A_019786-019910 oh yeah
sw04208-A_020372-020501 well that's pretty nifty
sw04208-A_020625-021173 yeah well what do you think about Unix in terms of it's popularity if do you think that is going to blossom or what
sw04208-A_021658-021758 yeah
sw04208-A_022255-022359 um-hum
sw04208-A_023552-023648 right
sw04208-A_024165-024268 yeah
sw04208-A_024534-024625 um-hum
sw04208-A_024994-026087 yeah now that's the best that's the real good thing is the versatility and everything i i've got a lot of friends that work at NASA and uh and Cape Kennedy and things and they're all really like
sw04208-A_026087-027003 really pro Unix kind of like that's the future of mankind in computing you know type of thing and i'm not i'm not real certain that i agree with that but
sw04208-A_027910-028072 with Microsoft
sw04208-A_028072-028271 or with IBM yeah
sw04208-A_029001-029099 yeah
sw04208-A_029260-029347 hum
sw04208-A_029618-029748 no uh
sw04208-A_029909-029955 that's
sw04208-B_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04208-B_000069-000668 uh don't don't bit your tongue no no actually i'm a system engineer and uh
sw04208-B_000668-001102 i i'm sitting right know before there my Mac is at my right hand and my
sw04208-B_001102-001321 DOS machine is at my left hand and
sw04208-B_001468-001611 good for you
sw04208-B_002110-002203 um-hum
sw04208-B_002495-002593 um-hum
sw04208-B_003077-003178 uh-huh
sw04208-B_004157-004451 give me a graphical interface any day huh
sw04208-B_004451-004535 [laughter]
sw04208-B_005126-006560 yeah it seems to be the great equalizer that's one thing that i've notice is uh you you put uh open windows on a sun and i don't see amazing power from it it doesn't degrade as much under a load as a typical
sw04208-B_006560-007772 like an intel chip would but uh it it like i said i- i- i consider GUIs as a great equalizer you know they help people work but they seem to bring all of the machine to there knees
sw04208-B_008231-008452 oh really that's interesting work
sw04208-B_008860-008957 uh-huh
sw04208-B_009084-009308 that would be um
sw04208-B_009308-009565 this is a great time for you to be into it you know
sw04208-B_009934-010030 um-hum
sw04208-B_010245-010439 oh heads up this ways and such
sw04208-B_011275-011516 oh so are you a Star Trek fan
sw04208-B_011631-012104 i've heard a lot of really uh good thing from human factor people about the way that they
sw04208-B_012104-012444 you know the the the bridge of the new enterprise
sw04208-B_012912-013921 i work for a company called Western New York Computing System for twenty year old company and uh we are affiliated with MicroAge i know that
sw04208-B_013921-014266 makes people some people squeamish but uh
sw04208-B_014438-014937 yeah uh you know it's a it a it's fascinating work and uh
sw04208-B_014937-015206 never never a dull moment you know
sw04208-B_015958-016072 um-hum
sw04208-B_017524-017644 oh yeah
sw04208-B_017644-018753 on yeah you can just you know you can just type type type type get it all in there and make it look really excellent and uh some of some of the checkers and thing they have nowadays or
sw04208-B_018753-018934 are a real benefit
sw04208-B_018934-019553 oh yeah sure i even seen uh you can download a three dimensional
sw04208-B_019553-019871 uh Chemical CAD
sw04208-B_019871-020745 small package that lets you draw molecule in three dimension and huh scary stuff you know
sw04208-B_021075-021742 well i'm a little worried about um you know uh what do they call it a government poses
sw04208-B_021742-022635 but um because it could it could fragment it but the government has brought into that type of operating system know and the government seem to derive
sw04208-B_022635-023973 uh you know there is a whole other offshoot people company will developing for that market and then turn around and sell those products into the commercial markets and so i think were going to see a lot in there it's got a lot of promise i don't
sw04208-B_023973-024568 i mean it's it it's been underrated um you know you can you can scale the Unix system
sw04208-B_024568-025053 to fit the need you know you can go all the way from a desktop to a mainframe

sw04208-B_026960-028190 [noise] well i i'm i use to be um a very strong Apple supporter and i was a little worried about this unholy alliance that they have entered into with no with IBM
sw04208-B_028190-028747 but um you know there there there's a company called Talogent that's uh
sw04208-B_028747-029850 third spin off of both of the company it's like there there spawn [laughter] and uh there working on an object oriented operating system that is going to hold a lot of promise
sw04208-B_029850-029955 um [vocalized-noise]
sw04209-A_000000-000332 [noise] Jeff what do you think are you paying to much in taxes
sw04209-A_002986-003111 [laughter]
sw04209-A_003111-003665 well i- i i'm one of those that i'm kind of glad i don't get all the government i pay for
sw04209-A_003770-003981 [laughter]
sw04209-A_003981-005046 well i just ship off so much money to the federal government and if they really uh took it and and did things to govern me well that would be a lot more government than what i think i [laughter-need]
sw04209-A_005254-006210 oh uh the one i guess that on a daily basis the one that bother me is the sale tax i'm paying eight and a quarter percent on sale tax
sw04209-A_006210-006359 yes
sw04209-A_006359-006518 at
sw04209-A_006518-007436 yeah and and you know you you put put your money down on the counter thinking that is enough to pay for it then you need another dollar [laughter-because] you had not guess right on the sale [laughter-tax]
sw04209-A_008682-008795 oh yes
sw04209-A_009352-009652 that that sound great to me [laughter]
sw04209-A_009821-009975 [laughter]
sw04209-A_009975-010107 [vocalized-noise]
sw04209-A_010240-010423 yeah i suppose so
sw04209-A_010423-010981 yeah there there has been a lot of going on in Texas in term of financing schools
sw04209-A_010981-012268 uh there some judge decide that we had to have pay equal amount to students i mean you know education dollars per student all across the state well as you know it's very large state
sw04209-A_012268-012814 and it certainly cost more in in some areas than it does in others
sw04209-A_012814-012964 and [noise]
sw04209-A_012964-014405 the they they call it the robin hood pl[an]- plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i don't know that that's going to be in the courts for a long time
sw04209-A_015857-017348 huh well that that's about the attitude here is just that you know if if you're paying for your local tax you're paying your local school district you can see some results of it but it's if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something
sw04209-A_017348-017827 you it its almost like i don't know socialism or something isn't it
sw04209-A_019132-019251 yeah
sw04209-A_023880-023964 uh-huh
sw04209-A_025295-025513 i know huh
sw04209-A_025513-025649 huh
sw04209-A_025844-025947 yeah
sw04209-A_026670-026771 [laughter]
sw04209-A_026993-027201 yes it's true [laughter]
sw04209-A_027201-027606 that's true do you have income tax and [vocalized-noise]
sw04209-A_028085-028395 we don't have a state income tax yet
sw04209-A_028551-028789 huh it's coming
sw04209-A_028789-029151 it's it's on its way i i'm almost certain
sw04209-A_029151-029552 uh but that's why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax
sw04209-A_029663-029856 and an[d]- you know the the dam[age]-
sw04209-B_000000-000022 [noise]
sw04209-B_000258-001101 i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think it's mostly on the federal area were i don't see as much
sw04209-B_001101-001624 maybe fo[r]- for my money as uh i might uh i thought of
sw04209-B_001624-003064 school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh it's all fat [laughter]
sw04209-B_003064-003260 how about you
sw04209-B_003745-004055 i tell me more i don't understand [laughter]
sw04209-B_004994-005439 [laughter] uh
sw04209-B_006119-006259 [vocalized-noise]
sw04209-B_006378-006589 yeah that that adds up
sw04209-B_007118-007220 uh-huh
sw04209-B_007390-007688 it certainly adds up quickly yes
sw04209-B_007688-008791 and i've heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax
sw04209-B_008791-009349 um i guess that's i- i guess i'm luck here i only pay five percent
sw04209-B_009349-009475 and
sw04209-B_009475-010339 [laughter] well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another [laughter]
sw04209-B_010339-010541 [laughter]
sw04209-B_011783-011942 um-hum
sw04209-B_012067-012230 cool
sw04209-B_012702-013057 exactly they uh [laughter]
sw04209-B_013187-013322 [laughter]
sw04209-B_014343-014884 i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and
sw04209-B_014884-016068 the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for [laughter]
sw04209-B_017215-017329 yeah
sw04209-B_017772-019174 exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children
sw04209-B_019174-020429 and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles
sw04209-B_020429-020585 and
sw04209-B_020585-022068 can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically e[qual]- well base upon their income
sw04209-B_022068-022702 to i'm sorry i- i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh
sw04209-B_022702-023909 to support doing thing like that and that's probably okay uh it's kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles
sw04209-B_023909-024784 uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also
sw04209-B_024784-025926 uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i don't have any kids in school i've been retried for thirty five years and i'm still paying for somebody education
sw04209-B_025926-027039 i- i guess i'm a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time i'll hate to have to ante up before they got here
sw04209-B_027039-027302 [laughter]
sw04209-B_027449-028150 yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay
sw04209-B_028469-028705 well [laughter]
sw04209-B_028705-028935 [laughter]
sw04209-B_028935-029053 yeah
sw04209-B_029173-029338 i i certainly
sw04209-B_029551-029704 that's true
sw04210-A_000000-000198 [noise] what kind of air pollution do you think is the worst
sw04210-A_000647-000781 cars
sw04210-A_001370-001788 yeah but they c[ouldn't]- there is a lot of different pollution you can get from cars right
sw04210-A_002725-003137 um-hum there is carbon monoxide carbon dioxide
sw04210-A_003137-003317 nitric oxide
sw04210-A_003458-003668 the all that kind of stuff
sw04210-A_004165-004396 yeah and there's ozone
sw04210-A_004509-004734 it's like uh from
sw04210-A_004734-005042 also like when you fill-up your car with gas
sw04210-A_005581-005804 oh yeah that's right yeah
sw04210-A_006202-006421 yeah um-hum yeah
sw04210-A_006699-006882 uh [laughter]
sw04210-A_007027-007128 hum
sw04210-A_007354-007472 oh
sw04210-A_007472-007813 [vocalized-noise]
sw04210-A_007813-007925 huh
sw04210-A_007925-008208 well let's see what else there's uh
sw04210-A_008208-008645 more more sometimes they say it more pollution inside your house
sw04210-A_008941-009157 well i got the dry cleaning
sw04210-A_009157-009417 that stuff is pretty n[asty]- nasty
sw04210-A_009417-010062 um i know all the kind of fumes you can get from bathroom cleaners your aerosols
sw04210-A_010849-011459 chlorofluo[rocarbons]- chloro[fluorocarbons]- chlorofluorocar[bons]- or something like that chlorofluorocarbons that's it [laughter]
sw04210-A_012033-012496 wh[at]- si[mple]- simple green is supposedly [vocalized-noise] it not toxic really
sw04210-A_012766-012934 oh yeah yeah
sw04210-A_014521-014687 what is it
sw04210-A_014687-014952 scrub free huh
sw04210-A_014952-015071 well
sw04210-A_016699-016983 oh really where are you originally from
sw04210-A_016983-017205 oh huh
sw04210-A_017904-018573 well not always depends if you don't there if there's a brief stop then you get the uh smog
sw04210-A_018573-019433 doesn't move like you're out in Lake Tahoe its like that you can really smell the gas fumes from cars the air is trap and it doesn't go anywhere
sw04210-A_019433-019870 in fact the worst place is probably in Mexi[co]- Mexico City i heard is
sw04210-A_019870-020083 [vocalized-noise]
sw04210-A_020083-020401 well they validated i think uh
sw04210-A_020401-020994 one or two hundred day uh days out of a year over three or four times the
sw04210-A_020994-021270 known you know the allowable limit
sw04210-A_021270-022053 it crazy and uh some of the worst kind that our you can have also air pollution you can just have cigarette smoke
sw04210-A_022053-022258 stuck in [vocalized-noise]
sw04210-A_022725-022892 in a laundry mate
sw04210-A_023377-023602 [laughter]
sw04210-A_023602-023785 oh gosh
sw04210-A_023916-024024 um-hum
sw04210-A_024144-024311 really wow
sw04210-A_024699-024838 hum
sw04210-A_024838-024973 oh
sw04210-A_025431-025818 i know which is worst cigar smoke or regular cigarette smoke
sw04210-A_025818-026831 [laughter]
sw04210-A_026831-026976 yeah hum
sw04210-A_027502-027667 [laughter]
sw04210-A_027667-028253 uh i don't know its a lot of smoke ou[t]- uh out her you can see um
sw04210-A_028253-028817 the New Jersey when you go by the refinery or even when you go across the Delaware River
sw04210-A_028817-029102 down by uh
sw04210-A_029102-029535 it passes away but down as you go down toward ninety five you see all that
sw04210-A_029535-029904 that stuff that comes out of the refineries [vocalized-noise]
sw04210-B_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04210-B_000198-000705 in Philadelphia i think the worst is cars
sw04210-B_000705-001344 because_1 there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in Philadelphia any more at least not any heavy manufacturing
sw04210-B_001747-002762 right a lot of pollution from cars and also the trucks that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city
sw04210-B_003100-003305 oh right uh-huh
sw04210-B_003305-003438 uh-huh
sw04210-B_003650-004189 and plus we get the -[chloro]fluorocarbons i guess from the old refrigerator and old cars
sw04210-B_004391-004517 right
sw04210-B_005011-005693 well you know in Philadelphia they've got these g[as]- vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now
sw04210-B_005693-006199 if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out
sw04210-B_006430-006781 it makes it really hard to tell when your tank is full though
sw04210-B_006781-007076 because_1 you can't really lessen very well
sw04210-B_007076-007410 you have to just trust the automatic shut off
sw04210-B_007410-007869 so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard
sw04210-B_008646-008988 yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah
sw04210-B_009115-009216 uh-huh
sw04210-B_010062-010466 that's true though most help aid don't let me use
sw04210-B_010466-010900 bathroom cleaner with bad uh chemicals in them any more
sw04210-B_011353-012086 right they make me use Simple Green or um they will let me use Comet or self cleanser but
sw04210-B_012311-012829 right it it suppose to be none toxics and its suppose to be good for the environment
sw04210-B_012829-013002 so they like that
sw04210-B_013002-013148 i prefer uh
sw04210-B_013148-013263 ammonia
sw04210-B_013363-013494 and um
sw04210-B_013494-013705 there's something my mamma gave me
sw04210-B_013705-014017 last time i was visiting her its a
sw04210-B_014017-014594 it's called scrub free it really makes a bad odor though so my housemate don't like that
sw04210-B_014594-014745 scrub free
sw04210-B_014852-014952 right
sw04210-B_015056-015925 you know i knew that the air in Philadelphia was not the greatest when i first came here it i lived where i could on a clear day
sw04210-B_015925-016735 see the Walt Whitman bridge but i couldn't see it for a a couple of months until it got to be winter time and the pollution cleared up
sw04210-B_016901-017054 from South Carolina
sw04210-B_017169-017943 but the amazing thing i was out at San Francisco a few years ago and the air there is so clean
sw04210-B_017943-018531 [noise]
sw04210-B_018531-018640 right
sw04210-B_019388-019496 uh-huh
sw04210-B_019866-020103 right on the top of the mountain yeah
sw04210-B_021206-021309 right
sw04210-B_022090-022738 oh cigarette smoke the worst place for air pollution of cigarette smoke is the laundry mat i hate that
sw04210-B_022857-023454 right when people come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out
sw04210-B_023454-023895 and they're all clean and you want to hang them_1 up and
sw04210-B_023895-024189 there all these people smoking there
sw04210-B_024189-024714 fortunately i've started going at an hour where not many people smoke
sw04210-B_024714-024902 but
sw04210-B_024902-025314 i really hated that when that was a problem for me
sw04210-B_025868-026080 uh boy
sw04210-B_026247-026516 um
sw04210-B_026516-026914 boy i'll chose regular cigarette smoke
sw04210-B_026914-027557 but if there was as many people smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst
sw04210-B_029770-029904 oh right
sw04211-A_000000-000443 [noise] okay uh well what do you think is there something wrong with public schools
sw04211-A_000829-000961 oh is that right
sw04211-A_000961-001043 uh-huh
sw04211-A_001401-001517 uh-huh
sw04211-A_001853-001951 uh-huh
sw04211-A_002049-002131 right
sw04211-A_002514-002734 you feel they get a better education
sw04211-A_003932-004072 um-hum
sw04211-A_005243-005387 [vocalized-noise]
sw04211-A_005387-005508 right
sw04211-A_005760-006605 right they have the same motivation for sending their children their well i think there is a problem with with the public s[chool]- education system and i
sw04211-A_006605-007291 i think it is demonstrating by the fact so many people uh graduating from high school and can't even uh perform
sw04211-A_007291-008700 some simple uh math problems and uh or or even read a a decent uh book uh or geography i mean some of them can't even identify the states United States or various places in the world so
sw04211-A_008700-009969 i think that we are sending uh some some children out into the world with a very poor education foundation and i think that the problem started when the National Education Association stop being
sw04211-A_009969-011020 for education and really became more of a labor union and only put their main entrance in teachers pay like ed[ucation]- like money was the the solution to every thing
sw04211-A_011020-012517 [noise] i think that the i think the answer is something what you are doing right now i think that a voucher system or some competition between schools to give uh parents a choice of where they send their children to schools and allowing
sw04211-A_012517-013108 uh the school to compete with one another the become better i think that is the American way
sw04211-A_016050-016206 uh-huh
sw04211-A_016557-016655 right
sw04211-A_017174-017258 um-hum
sw04211-A_018116-018227 that's
sw04211-A_018351-018450 uh-huh
sw04211-A_018664-018786 um-hum
sw04211-A_018911-019052 a magnetic school
sw04211-A_020339-020465 uh-huh
sw04211-A_021409-021519 [vocalized-noise]
sw04211-A_022085-022181 right
sw04211-A_022929-023048 um-hum
sw04211-A_023397-023488 um-hum
sw04211-A_025920-026068 uh-huh
sw04211-A_026068-027203 i think part of the problem with the education system really isn't the education system but it really has to do with the loss of the family structure in the United States and the loss values of
sw04211-A_027203-028052 uh you know the guidance that went along with the stable family structure isn't isn't there for all the kids like it use to be
sw04211-B_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04211-B_000415-000559 well
sw04211-B_000559-000874 i'm not so that i am not willing to send my kids to them
sw04211-B_000997-001926 yeah now that's partly because i want my children to have a religious education uh which a public school can not and should not
sw04211-B_001926-002489 offer uh but it's also because
sw04211-B_002609-003201 i fill that they'll get a better education i fill that i have more control over
sw04211-B_003201-003556 uh the type of social
sw04211-B_003657-004181 pressure that they get expose to because i can choose
sw04211-B_004305-005171 you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that they're getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because
sw04211-B_005283-005900 it works both you know because not only am i doing this but presuming the other parents are doing the same thing
sw04211-B_006011-006127 yeah
sw04211-B_006127-006249 yeah
sw04211-B_010802-010899 yeah
sw04211-B_011072-011180 yeah
sw04211-B_013075-013603 well i think i- i think that that works too uh
sw04211-B_013780-013957 you know i
sw04211-B_014134-015191 i sometimes wonder there a a school system near me that they actually a fairly good one what they've done is they had one school that was
sw04211-B_015191-016652 because of the neighborhood the neighborhood school system basic the school system basically and they put their talented and gifted program in the poorest school district you know the or the poo[rest]- poorest elementary district that was part of this larger district
sw04211-B_016652-017814 and um they allowed any of those neighborhood children who wanted to stay there to stay and then they didn't it wasn't that they had the talented and gifted program just housed in this building
sw04211-B_017814-018976 all of the classes were based on talented and gifted and all the kids were treated the same way and as a result this is now the best school in the school district which is really kind of interesting
sw04211-B_018976-019588 well it's essentially a magnetic school that's right but it's also a neighborhood school you know and
sw04211-B_019588-020189 the neigh[borhood]- there are some of the neighborhood kids who can't manage and
sw04211-B_020189-020546 the talented and gifted program because
sw04211-B_020546-020866 and i think it's more case of
sw04211-B_020866-021602 you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps [vocalized-noise] you know and and they just
sw04211-B_021602-022973 not only can not compete they simple didn't you know those kids really felt uncomfortable but the majority of kids if they're taught the way that they teach talented and gifted kids it turns out the majority of kids really are that way
sw04211-B_022973-024057 you know each one a little bit different but each one has a lot to offer so that's a public school that works but then there are other public schools in that same district that really don't work
sw04211-B_024057-024228 and
sw04211-B_024356-024923 and unfortunately even that school although it seems to be working academically has
sw04211-B_025028-026038 some um some real race problems that uh which is real unfortunate because_1 most of the kids who comes in are white and most of the kids who are there are black or
sw04211-B_027902-028020 yeah
sw04211-B_028020-028568 yeah i think you right i think you right and i think that a caring teacher
sw04211-B_028568-029907 can do a lot to change that but then you are not talking about is it a public school is it a private school is it you talking about you know are you and the kids are going to be lucky enough to hit the teacher who can get home
sw04212-A_000000-000026 [noise]
sw04212-A_000026-000426 well Jim sounds like you're starting out on something new uh
sw04212-A_000426-000563 so
sw04212-A_000563-000914 what kind of uh aspect do you have as for as budgeting
sw04212-A_001449-001593 um-hum
sw04212-A_004032-004175 good
sw04212-A_005358-005456 um-hum
sw04212-A_006334-006842 well that's good [noise] i guess our situation uh
sw04212-A_006842-008077 well we've been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is it's actually minimum and we've gone through period where we've needed to budget on quite formally but uh we've gotten to where we structure
sw04212-A_008077-008812 a lot of our thing so that they uh u[se]- use a automatic debit with our banking account [noise]
sw04212-A_009454-010026 right yeah i guess um you know the situation i'm in um
sw04212-A_010026-011335 my pay is [vocalized-noise] given at a particular period of time and it never varies and you know so there's something that we've just found that it works best to deal with the you know the the regular fixed expenses uh
sw04212-A_012159-012253 yeah
sw04212-A_012363-012812 yeah um [noise] i guess um
sw04212-A_012812-013785 there really haven't been a lot of thing that we have picked on that have work for us other then you know [vocalized-noise] the uh the automatic
sw04212-A_013785-014105 debits req[uire]- require more discipline
sw04212-A_014105-014524 um it also simplifies in that [vocalized-noise]
sw04212-A_014675-015735 doesn't require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and uh so actually we live in uh
sw04212-A_015735-016204 in [vocalized-noise] in Canada and so with our banking system being more national
sw04212-A_016204-016680 uh it does make uh funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more
sw04212-A_016680-016829 readily available
sw04212-A_017233-017312 um-hum
sw04212-A_019362-019579 great
sw04212-A_020056-020201 yeah
sw04212-A_020201-020498 oh i would think you know i would think it did
sw04212-A_020498-020579 um
sw04212-A_020579-022033 [noise] yeah i guess you know in the late of budgeting it's something that we always have been very week on and i guess for us the challenge is now that we've got a son fifteen and a daughter eighteen that we're trying to train
sw04212-A_022640-022753 um-hum
sw04212-A_024085-024230 right
sw04212-A_024494-024598 um
sw04212-A_024924-025036 right
sw04212-A_026238-026363 yeah
sw04212-A_027267-027428 yeah and that's
sw04212-A_027428-028337 [noise] that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about it myself is the budgeting impact from a parenting role uh
sw04212-A_028337-028504 it t[ake]-
sw04212-A_028504-028894 it takes so long for a person to develop
sw04212-A_028894-029539 that budgeting skill and there's [noise] i think it's going to become more critical because
sw04212-A_029539-029625 of
sw04212-A_029625-029763 were now [noise]
sw04212-B_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04212-B_000871-002052 well we're we're actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so it's kind of a double whammy uh where i- i stood out uh i been few i uh bachelor for a long time so
sw04212-B_002052-002998 you know i was kind of living for the the day and [vocalized-noise] what a debt so the last year or so i've been killing off a lot of debt and actually and uh

sw04212-B_004274-005192 w[e]- we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class uh
sw04212-B_005192-005817 save every penny you've got [laughter-family] so we've kind of i taught her to to let go a little bit more and she taught me to
sw04212-B_005817-006245 do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff we're doing
sw04212-B_008672-008962 yeah i- i use to do that but um
sw04212-B_008962-009517 i found that it it doesn't give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to
sw04212-B_011215-012149 yeah i- i suppose when when you've got y[ou]- you know a a when you got a good pad of of money where you know you don't ha[ve]- have when you're not you know you cash flow bound
sw04212-B_012149-012352 that's where to work at
sw04212-B_012352-012472 um
sw04212-B_016595-017120 yeah i've i've got i've got direct direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have Quicken

sw04213-A_019515-019938 yeah oh i see what you are saying so
sw04213-A_020378-020582 yeah [noise]
sw04213-A_021128-021258 yeah
sw04213-A_021983-022230 oh well so when it
sw04213-A_022338-022929 yeah so in in other words they they make you wait or you
sw04213-A_023449-023576 yeah
sw04213-A_024221-024354 yeah

sw04213-A_028689-028875 [laughter]
sw04213-A_028875-029192 but they're still going to have problems though
sw04213-A_029192-029386 [noise] yeah
sw04213-A_029386-029799 well they break into somebody house and just take their guns [vocalized-noise]
sw04213-B_000000-000267 [noise] gun control means using two hands
sw04213-B_002469-003176 oh i agree i mean i don't see any particular sporting purpose in anything that explodes when it arise
sw04213-B_003176-003729 and i can't quite understand what i do you know what you a rational for a machine gun
sw04213-B_003846-003974 but
sw04213-B_003974-004470 i mean to say that the quote assault rifle is
sw04213-B_004571-004736 you know a bad thing
sw04213-B_004736-005090 all that is is a change in a stock configuration
sw04213-B_005090-005252 if you think about it
sw04213-B_005354-005806 because_1 you know they been making semi automatic
sw04213-B_005806-006140 classically style if you will
sw04213-B_006140-006342 rifle for years
sw04213-B_006452-006924 and the and the only thing between the assault rifle and that is a stock is a stock change
sw04213-B_007179-007359 what can i say right
sw04213-B_008353-008511 oh okay
sw04213-B_008511-009320 yeah i just uh you know i just can't quite understand it's interesting is uh i get down to Texas quite a bit
sw04213-B_009320-009898 and uh you know it's interesting how when you get away from
sw04213-B_010006-010377 you know north of the middle of Virginia
sw04213-B_010377-010653 how altitude change
sw04213-B_011433-011540 um-hum
sw04213-B_012043-012366 well i'm from central Virginia and it's
sw04213-B_012366-012501 you know it's
sw04213-B_012501-013251 not uncommon at all to drive down the road and you know there's a you know the the shotgun is in the back of the pickup
sw04213-B_013251-013410 you know
sw04213-B_013410-013877 and so it just you know wha[t]- you get up here it gets really weird
sw04213-B_014717-015037 right where where are you from in Dallas
sw04213-B_015037-015212 i mean from Texas
sw04213-B_015332-015463 okay
sw04213-B_015636-016047 yeah i flown into Dallas Fort Worth a bit so
sw04213-B_017200-017404 but it's you know it's
sw04213-B_017404-017826 it's sig[nificant]- i just detected a significantly different altitude
sw04213-B_017826-018044 like up here
sw04213-B_018044-018422 you would find it very difficult to go to like
sw04213-B_018422-019192 most of the sporting good stores up here hardly they may carry firearms but would have to hunt for them_1
sw04213-B_019192-019584 and you go to Texas and that's just part of the store
sw04213-B_019771-020443 yeah you know i mean you might go you would to you know go to a major chain like a KMart
sw04213-B_020443-021190 is you will have a hard time up here in a KMart finding somebody to sell you a gun if they may have three or four of them_1 on display
sw04213-B_021190-022000 when you go to a KMart in Texas in you know that's a major section of the sporting good section that all the difference i'm saying
sw04213-B_022103-022391 they don't even [vocalized-noise] totally different
sw04213-B_022779-023079 uh Virginia's by county
sw04213-B_023079-023478 is there's no wait for a long gun
sw04213-B_023478-024051 there's in some county it's whatever the county wants
sw04213-B_024051-024256 statewide there's no wait
sw04213-B_024363-025021 which is stupid because if i don't want to wait three days in the county that i live in i'll drive to the next county there isn't a wait
sw04213-B_025021-025164 [laughter-you] know
sw04213-B_025324-025693 you know [laughter] i mean that you know it's uh
sw04213-B_025693-026271 in fact they got big trouble is Washington DC is got total band on firearms
sw04213-B_026271-026437 you can't own one
sw04213-B_026566-026988 but they're killing each other by you know five and six a night in that city
sw04213-B_027284-028716 well but you understand what i'm saying is is their gun control is a hundred percent but it doesn't work so now they say well we got to you know they're saying Virginia and Maryland got to have gun control so they can't you can't buy g[un]- gun in Virginia and Maryland and bring them to DC
sw04213-B_029085-029259 no they just steal them_1
sw04213-B_029702-029907 oh they don't break into to people houses they
sw04214-A_000000-000031 [noise]
sw04214-A_000031-000342 hi what kind of pets do you have

sw04214-A_014809-015681 i mean it wasn't like very obvious and so we name him Tiffany because he seems like a pretty prissy little cat and we thought it was a she

sw04214-B_003400-004294 they're [vocalized-noise] median hair uh their like their hair length is like a tubby but uh an[d]- actually they're closer related to the American tabby
sw04214-B_004294-005278 but they have uh they call them folds because they have this genetic anomaly that makes their ears fold over and so they look like they're s[narling]- they're snarling all the time

sw04214-B_011039-011188 right

sw04214-B_016148-016767 look at look at Johnny Cash song [laughter] yeah that's
sw04214-B_017033-017168 uh-huh
sw04214-B_017702-018295 yeah we had a we had a red uh doberman uh a long time ago
sw04214-B_018295-019038 and we called we we named it uh Mistral as in the as in the mus[ic]- you know like the Wondering Mistral you know
sw04214-B_019038-019678 but uh an[d]- not real reali[ze]- because we were you know [noise] we just didn't realized what it was going to sound like you know when we went out the back door
sw04214-B_019678-020462 you know and scream you know Mistral Mistral [laughter] [laughter-wish] [laughter-i] [laughter-could] [laughter-have] [laughter-saw] [laughter-our] [laughter-neighbor] [laughter-like] [laughter-what] [laughter-the] [laughter-hell] [laughter-going] [laughter-on] [laughter-over] [laughter-there]
sw04214-B_020462-021156 [laughter] and we didn't realized for the longest time why everybody thought it was so funny until we finally picked up on it but
sw04214-B_021156-021265 anyway the
sw04214-B_021265-021755 [laughter] it was a it was a really good dog i was i was amazed at the uh
sw04214-B_021755-022650 the energy that doberman have i never realized it compared to Great Danes i mean Danes are like just really slow moving animals and uh
sw04214-B_022766-022937 yeah
sw04214-B_022937-023166 just {boings} up in the air
sw04214-B_023166-023305 yeah
sw04214-B_024298-024426 uh-huh
sw04214-B_024735-024840 yeah
sw04214-B_025050-025722 it we had a it when when we first got the uh the cats our Great Dane was standing in the living room
sw04214-B_025722-026675 and the cats you know literally were just out of the out the bag you know they just came out and their wondering around and one of them_1 wonders in to the leg of the dog
sw04214-B_026675-027422 and it the the dog doesn't move you know and you can see the cat the cat kind of looks at it re[ally]- think you know thinks this must be a chair leg or something you know
sw04214-B_027422-028183 and just kind of progressively looks up higher and higher until it looks up and then there this gigantic face you know right in front of the cat's [laughter-face]
sw04214-B_028183-028953 [laughter] it real[ly]- it really freaked the cat out you know he was like [noise] [laughter] [laughter-took] [laughter-off] [laughter]
sw04214-B_028953-029575 [laughter] [laughter-exactly] but that [laughter-was] that that was one of the funnier uh things that happen
sw04214-B_029575-029904 [laughter-yeah] [laughter] but uh their
sw04215-A_000000-000066 [noise]
sw04215-A_000066-000335 okay so we are talking about recycling
sw04215-A_000335-000684 i- i just move down from uh up near Boston
sw04215-A_000684-000990 yes and up there they're doing quite a bit
sw04215-A_000990-001890 they they one of the thing that they've tried doing is they've had it they got a uh deposit on all uh plastic containers you know bottles what not
sw04215-A_001890-002094 and [vocalized-noise]
sw04215-A_002200-003088 i mean like Coke bottles things like that and also cans so it's a five cent deposit on all of those uh which you know encourages somewhat for people to bring them back
sw04215-A_003088-003518 there also in areas up their that mandated uh separating your garbage
sw04215-A_003518-003650 uh
sw04215-A_003875-004175 from the paper i believe even right
sw04215-A_004175-005185 so i know that they're doing and up there and several community down here they're not doing a hole lot down here uh their actually are some community where they mandating that uh most i think it's aluminum from everything else
sw04215-A_005185-006077 and also it's against the law anywhere in the county down here to uh deposit uh yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash
sw04215-A_006077-006353 so that's what they're doing here what are they doing there
sw04215-A_008950-009076 but it
sw04215-A_009076-009252 but it still voluntary
sw04215-A_011739-012079 what of the other things that there was been done up in Massachusetts
sw04215-A_012079-012727 that was very good were several of the grocery store chains were uh instituting a five cent credit if you brought back your bags and reuse them_1
sw04215-A_012874-012978 uh
sw04215-A_013500-013679 [laughter]
sw04215-A_013877-014022 sure
sw04215-A_014443-014778 you haven't seen any i haven't seen any of that down here
sw04215-A_015684-015825 sure
sw04215-A_016163-016495 right my parents uh live in Little Rock Arkansas
sw04215-A_016495-017385 yes well they do and they uh and i- i sent my mom a couple of those canvas bags just so she can do that because they you know they look at her like she was crazy there
sw04215-A_019002-019131 sure
sw04215-A_019354-020032 unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like Plano i where it's not as densely populating uh you know the whole area
sw04215-A_020032-020854 that it is a lot easier for people to uh you know ignore the landfill problem where as New Jersey Massachusetts you know New England [vocalized-noise]
sw04215-A_020854-020975 right
sw04215-A_021355-022144 Massachusetts is getting there well [vocalized-noise] Boston is like Massachusetts is very heavily populated you know western Massachusetts is not
sw04215-A_022245-023086 no no actually not i was i was born in Alabama and i lived in Oklahoma where we didn't do any recycling i lived in Arkansas Massachusetts now Florida
sw04215-A_023194-023572 so Massachusetts is probably like like i said the best of what i seen there
sw04215-A_024285-024434 sure
sw04215-A_024434-025689 well [vocalized-noise] there's there's actually some other good ideas that have come up where for example i think this was actually originated in Oklahoma city on the uh where they scrape the uh top of the roads off and they actually remixed that and use it again
sw04215-A_025689-026069 you know for the asphalt so they're gonna you know trash out
sw04215-A_026316-026488 so why don't Oklahoma city thought of that
sw04215-A_026830-026976 sure
sw04215-A_027348-027463 sure
sw04215-A_027566-027995 i- i believe in Baltimore they're recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt
sw04215-A_027995-028418 yes which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier
sw04215-A_028418-028567 because_1 they sparkle
sw04215-A_029378-029615 my sister is born in Baltimore
sw04215-A_029615-029846 born in Baltimore
sw04215-A_029846-030048 i- i don't know
sw04215-B_000000-000103 [noise]
sw04215-B_000248-000437 recycling yeah
sw04215-B_000606-000773 oh you did
sw04215-B_000914-001054 uh-huh
sw04215-B_001946-002237 you mean like bottles of what kind
sw04215-B_002345-002616 oh Coke bottle okay yeah
sw04215-B_003005-003198 oh that's terrific
sw04215-B_003499-003915 yeah so you have to se[parate]- separate the glass from the plastic from the
sw04215-B_003915-004249 from the paper oh that's really
sw04215-B_005153-005271 yeah
sw04215-B_005899-006120 yeah yeah
sw04215-B_006310-007492 well i i'm very interested in this because_1 i think it's it's extremely necessary and i i've tried to you know from the very beginning i- i started you know um trying to recycling even before they had any program
sw04215-B_007492-008250 you know they they just sort of had voluntary trash uh you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they it's they're trying to have um
sw04215-B_008250-009187 a city wide program where they're actually have special trucks to pick up your separated um plastic and glass and uh newspapers
sw04215-B_009187-010062 but well they've they've got trucks for part of the city and and they haven't gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of Plano
sw04215-B_010062-010765 so some of the people in Plano do have that recycling and it's pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we don't
sw04215-B_010765-011790 so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know the glass bin and the and the aluminum and and uh but there they don't take plastic
sw04215-B_012661-012879 oh that's great
sw04215-B_012879-013751 see we're we don't have that e[ither]- yet either and i'm trying you know i keep trying to remember to bring my little canvas bag into the store with me but i can't remember to [laughter-do] [laughter-it]
sw04215-B_013751-013929 it's real hard to break that habit
sw04215-B_013929-014586 you know just going into the grocery for five or six thing and then you get in there you think why i don't have the bag with me you know
sw04215-B_014708-015699 but we have uh you know a lot now i saw one lady not to long ago with five or six of those canvas bags and she had them_1 all with her and she took her grocery home in those which i thought was great
sw04215-B_015699-015964 [noise] but nobody does that i mean it's
sw04215-B_015964-016220 you you just never see anybody with them_1
sw04215-B_016220-016324 so
sw04215-B_016435-016650 oh they did yeah that's not to
sw04215-B_016650-016814 oh they do okay
sw04215-B_017056-017250 yeah well good for you
sw04215-B_017359-017875 yeah yeah they they really we we need to encourage i mean i know in New Jersey where i'm from
sw04215-B_017875-019079 originally i'm from there and you know they've been doing um the gla[ss]- you know the pickup of separating trash and mandatory for a long time they've they've been doing it for at least [noise] a year or two
sw04215-B_019079-019441 but um but Plano just needs to get more of these trucks
sw04215-B_019981-020098 yeah
sw04215-B_020453-020605 oh yeah
sw04215-B_020718-021466 see they have to do it yeah New Jersey especially i mean that's a really pop[ulated]- highly populated state i guess Massachusetts is to
sw04215-B_022035-022362 is not is that where you're from originally is that where you were born
sw04215-B_022898-023054 yeah
sw04215-B_023054-023277 yeah so you've been around
sw04215-B_023546-024524 well it's i just i just think the more you you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little or something big whatever you can do
sw04215-B_024524-024633 but
sw04215-B_025757-025990 oh yes
sw04215-B_025990-026324 oh that's a neat idea i never would have thought of that
sw04215-B_026427-026905 well that's the that's the thing that there are thing you can do that you can't you know nobody thinks about
sw04215-B_026905-027614 there are these things that people would get their minds working and just you know brainstorming that you just can it's a whole new way of thinking
sw04215-B_027934-028176 are they really well that's neat
sw04215-B_028408-028864 oh for heaven sakes that's right that's amazing because_1 we use to live in Baltimore
sw04215-B_028864-029427 we lived there for a while before we came down and we lived in Pennsylvania and then we came here about fifteen years ago
sw04215-B_029590-029934 she was where she was at what hospital
sw04216-A_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04216-A_000097-000341 okay i guess we can just go ahead and start
sw04216-A_000341-001242 so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered
sw04216-A_001242-001925 is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that
sw04216-A_001925-002930 uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and i'm paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same
sw04216-A_002930-003545 she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks don't come at the same time mine do
sw04216-A_003545-004004 and she doesn't get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid
sw04216-A_004004-005272 and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have
sw04216-A_005272-006525 and uh so what we've done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it
sw04216-A_006525-007577 so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive
sw04216-A_007577-007866 and that's that's been fairly effective
sw04216-A_008046-008481 hum you mean like recently [laughter] right
sw04216-A_008992-010157 exactly and that's uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one
sw04216-A_010157-011284 and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also we've got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund
sw04216-A_011284-012246 and that's kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing
sw04216-A_012246-012498 so uh
sw04216-A_012498-012669 no
sw04216-A_012669-012816 right
sw04216-A_013842-014065 don't even have one
sw04216-A_014382-014523 um-hum
sw04216-A_014817-014962 yeah
sw04216-A_015154-015298 right
sw04216-A_015400-015556 um-hum
sw04216-A_015858-016013 um-hum
sw04216-A_016489-016639 uh-huh
sw04216-A_017350-017480 hum
sw04216-A_018299-018533 a different account huh um-hum
sw04216-A_018847-019352 [laughter-right] so you can the her money and then save it or right
sw04216-A_019649-019793 um-hum
sw04216-A_020103-020272 [noise]
sw04216-A_020372-020508 uh-hum
sw04216-A_020640-020779 right
sw04216-A_021242-021385 um-hum
sw04216-A_021852-021968 right
sw04216-A_022070-022353 a valuable uh budget yeah
sw04216-A_022597-022732 um-hum
sw04216-A_022732-022964 right um-hum
sw04216-A_023163-023348 um-hum
sw04216-A_024147-024232 hum
sw04216-A_024401-025490 we've got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that don't come on a
sw04216-A_025490-026306 uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months
sw04216-A_026306-027161 so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh
sw04216-A_027161-027682 certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up
sw04216-A_027682-028253 paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it
sw04216-A_029342-029487 um-hum
sw04216-B_000000-000103 [noise]
sw04216-B_000279-000416 sure enough
sw04216-B_001172-001303 ooh
sw04216-B_002702-002862 okay
sw04216-B_002862-003008 um-hum
sw04216-B_003468-003602 okay
sw04216-B_003919-004102 oh geez
sw04216-B_005250-005412 wow
sw04216-B_006497-006623 um-hum
sw04216-B_007550-007687 okay
sw04216-B_007796-008270 what happens if you get hit with some extraordinary expense
sw04216-B_008270-009099 well i mean you know [vocalized-noise] you know before you have a chance to say well geez we have a couple of months where we been low and put some off uh in the bank
sw04216-B_009425-009677 uh-huh ooh
sw04216-B_010100-010229 yeah
sw04216-B_010522-010646 um-hum
sw04216-B_011175-011311 um-hum
sw04216-B_012172-012325 sure
sw04216-B_012325-013344 well i mean you don't want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the bank but uh [noise] my gosh no i you know it's it's funny because when they came on they talked about
sw04216-B_013344-013703 a home budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself
sw04216-B_013703-014141 geez we don't have a [laughter] or turns out that you know
sw04216-B_014141-014436 uh my wife and i also work
sw04216-B_014436-015483 and uh she work for the federal government and i work almost for the federal [laughter-government] and but it's you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much you're going to get
sw04216-B_015483-015629 and
sw04216-B_015629-015941 uh i'm the only guy that pays any bills
sw04216-B_015941-017416 i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time [vocalized-noise] everybody who mails a bill like gas company and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the house and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every two weeks i'll sit down and and write checks
sw04216-B_017416-017873 well just recently we've we've found out that um
sw04216-B_017873-018408 we've had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account
sw04216-B_018408-019121 correct and we've been trying to live off my money which is not working [laughter-out]
sw04216-B_019121-019728 exactly we've been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house
sw04216-B_019728-020519 you know that was that way we wouldn't have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine
sw04216-B_020519-021460 and it just hasn't work out you know and it i i've read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much it's costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but
sw04216-B_021460-022058 uh what i've notice is that it's extremely difficult for us to come up with a
sw04216-B_022058-022975 uh it u[sually]- it it well co[st]- it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesn't work that [vocalized-noise] one month it's five hundred the next month it's
sw04216-B_022975-024438 it's a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh you're off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didn't spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean it's uh that's been my problem
sw04216-B_026236-026369 right
sw04216-B_027562-027826 [noise]
sw04216-B_027826-027981 um yeah
sw04216-B_028222-029002 well i do have to say that uh wh[en]- you know when we were real serious about budgeting the money and doing all of this my uh sister sent me a book
sw04216-B_029002-029442 [noise] and it was the book uh Wealth Without Risk by Charles Given
sw04216-B_029442-029939 and i do have to admit he had one suggestion in there that really
sw04217-A_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04217-A_002900-003144 yeah i- i agree with you there
sw04217-A_003144-003573 the metric system is very good i'm um i'm um
sw04217-A_003573-004606 do drafting i'm i'm a engineer and i've done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing
sw04217-A_004606-005780 and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all [noise] four different type of system with gravitational constant
sw04217-A_005780-006122 and it it just goes it just goes on and on
sw04217-A_006122-007009 -[a]nother th[ing]- thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them_1 so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier
sw04217-A_007009-007327 i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i
sw04217-A_007327-007703 i really think that what can be done differently
sw04217-A_007703-008976 is that it's it's to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template [vocalized-noise] our bolts our threads everything
sw04217-A_008976-009968 the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away
sw04217-A_010346-011290 well most of them_1 have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the
sw04217-A_011290-012133 the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thou[sand]- hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's
sw04217-A_012133-013580 and i guess maybe they could be re[sented]- some of them_1 could be resented but the comp[any]- the business community just doesn't want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier
sw04217-A_014154-014600 oh exactly also the trade you're you're exactly right
sw04217-A_014600-015006 yeah it's uh we need to do that
sw04217-A_015006-015697 and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation th[e]- th[e]-
sw04217-A_016938-017078 exactly
sw04217-A_017300-017449 in what
sw04217-A_017621-017773 [vocalized-noise]
sw04217-A_017894-018153 oh okay i know what that is yeah
sw04217-A_018427-018580 yeah it's it's
sw04217-A_018580-019486 you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use
sw04217-A_019486-020237 but we our [vocalized-noise] our society in the United State in the global in in the world
sw04217-A_020401-020963 and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be
sw04217-A_021110-021550 compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers
sw04217-A_021550-022449 and we've we've had to fight tooth and nail just to get them_1 to be some what compatible and they're all just going off and all dif[ferent]- all these different directions
sw04217-A_022449-023030 and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to pro[duce]- pro[duce]-
sw04217-A_023030-024134 -[pro]duce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny
sw04217-A_025463-025603 um-hum
sw04217-A_027093-027205 um-hum
sw04217-A_028050-028273 um-hum um-hum [noise]
sw04217-A_028273-028465 yeah well i guess
sw04217-A_028465-028627 so you just
sw04217-A_028742-029018 [noise] yeah i guess that's that's true
sw04217-A_029018-029777 i really [vocalized-noise] like first thought i can't really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh
sw04217-B_000000-000183 [noise] so i think the matrix system
sw04217-B_000183-001118 would be a wonderful thing for the United States and for um United States being able to trade more easy with other people in the world
sw04217-B_001118-001555 as the world economy become [vocalized-noise] much more global
sw04217-B_001555-002645 just having a standard system of measurement especially one that easy to calculate where G not become one and all kinds of nice stuff like that is
sw04217-B_002645-002928 just a wonderful advantage
sw04217-B_004531-004750 oh right yeah so you get
sw04217-B_005658-005886 that's exactly right
sw04217-B_006137-006217 i rem[ember]-
sw04217-B_006975-007099 right
sw04217-B_008865-009181 [noise] that's right the tools are that's the expensive thing
sw04217-B_009913-010398 that right if you think that every gar[age]- corner garage has to buy a whole new set of tools
sw04217-B_013589-014229 right but not only will their life would be ea[sier]- easier but they'll be able to make more money selling things abroad
sw04217-B_015600-015975 i know i most calculation i remember when i took fluid mechanics and
sw04217-B_015975-016986 i the professor was telling us how he wanted us to give the answer and i was he said he wanted them the answer in the English system because the engineers needed to know how to use the English system
sw04217-B_016986-017339 i- i treat to give my answer in {toundar}
sw04217-B_017339-018025 {toundar} which is a um {toundar} T O U N D A R
sw04217-B_018025-018414 so [laughter-he] he didn't like that very [laughter-much]
sw04217-B_021571-021676 right
sw04217-B_022093-022195 right
sw04217-B_024079-024504 well there's always the conflict between innovation and standardization
sw04217-B_024504-025242 and they're it's always going to be true that the most advantage advance thing and the thing that has the highest performance for any given
sw04217-B_025242-025578 [vocalized-noise] application are going to be non standard
sw04217-B_025578-025718 but
sw04217-B_025718-026311 for the general everyday things that have been worked out
sw04217-B_026311-026607 the standardization is such an advantage
sw04217-B_026607-027178 so and something like what side of the road you drive on
sw04217-B_027178-027559 i guess there was a time when that had to be [laughter-worked] [laughter-out]
sw04217-B_027559-027704 and
sw04217-B_027809-028178 before very many people were driving it wasn't a problem
sw04218-A_000000-000014 [noise]
sw04218-A_000014-000258 okay uh what's done in your area
sw04218-A_002176-002588 uh different types of plastic other than food types container plastic
sw04218-A_002588-002782 um what about glass
sw04218-A_003182-003537 s[o]- a[long]- along with the paper or or or the plastic and the
sw04218-A_003639-004233 yeah okay that's that's the way we do it here uh we have the addition thing of uh newspaper pickup
sw04218-A_004233-005289 but it doesn't include uh magazines or telephone books or just plain regular paper like computer print out just only for news print only
sw04218-A_005390-005742 that's not included that's that's completely different
sw04218-A_005742-005847 uh
sw04218-A_005847-007097 i feel you know it's kind of ridiculous you know you're only allowed to pick-up one sort of paper when you have something such as phone books which contributes a lot to uh waste paper they should pick that up as well
sw04218-A_007471-008797 yes that that would be good if they can if they would pick it up i- i- i put them in too because [vocalized-noise] so much of the uh junk mail that you get is made of the same type of uh print uh wax print
sw04218-A_008797-009031 that's makes it hard to recycle
sw04218-A_009682-009805 um-hum
sw04218-A_010256-010392 i see
sw04218-A_011247-011690 so do you feel people are uh hoarding [laughter] their garbage
sw04218-A_012151-012253 uh-huh
sw04218-A_012759-012868 i see
sw04218-A_013382-013619 rather steep i guess
sw04218-A_013849-013950 um-hum
sw04218-A_014051-014770 hum well wh[at]- what we have you just instituted here was a um uh biodegradable type pick-up
sw04218-A_014770-015616 uh once a week they'll come by and out of a container that you've mark only for biodegradable plant clippings lawn clippings
sw04218-A_015616-016321 uh it has to be decomposable matter no uh dirt uh no bricks or anything like that
sw04218-A_016321-016814 uh they'll pick that up once a week and we are not allowed to put that in normal trash
sw04218-A_017167-017612 that's right yeah they turn it to compose and where they put that i have the foggiest idea
sw04218-A_017612-017996 [laughter] because i don't see at along side the road
sw04218-A_017996-018452 uh it got to be this big huge pile somewhere in the city [laughter]
sw04218-A_018452-018584 or they just
sw04218-A_019571-019686 yes
sw04218-A_019686-020222 um wh[at]- what do you fill would be a good idea to encourage more recycling
sw04218-A_021217-021340 um-hum
sw04218-A_023444-023570 uh-huh
sw04218-A_023692-024331 what about the idea of um that some state have about force deposit on say beverage containers
sw04218-A_024331-024519 you think that's a good idea
sw04218-A_026066-026191 um-hum
sw04218-A_026829-026969 i say
sw04218-A_027070-027483 um that interesting because_1 i- i i [vocalized-noise] personally like the idea
sw04218-A_027483-028040 uh if i had uh five hundred cans saved up between soda and other beverages uh
sw04218-A_028149-028253 uh
sw04218-A_028834-029443 well if they did like what they did when i was younger were all soda bottles were returnable for the most part
sw04218-A_029443-029917 um every store had where you turned in the bottles and the manufact[ure]-
sw04218-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04218-B_000239-000512 well in our area we uh
sw04218-B_000512-000999 had basically a road side pick-up for uh aluminum cans plastic
sw04218-B_000999-001585 um that's about it if you want to participate with paper um
sw04218-B_001585-002183 wood and other products alone that line uh different types of plastic you have to bring physically down to the dump
sw04218-B_002445-002579 right
sw04218-B_002755-003119 um glass actually that's handle on the road side too
sw04218-B_003291-003683 along with no glass and the aluminum together
sw04218-B_005250-005418 what about cardboard
sw04218-B_007105-007534 [noise] what do you think about the value of of magazines as you mentioned
sw04218-B_007534-009029 uh
sw04218-B_009029-009285 well in our town we've imposed um
sw04218-B_009387-010058 [vocalized-noise] basically a [vocalized-noise] sign that forces people to recycle you have to pay for all your trash all your trash bags
sw04218-B_010058-010280 there's no more municipal trash pick-up
sw04218-B_010280-010822 and that intricate people encourages them to uh reduce there waste
sw04218-B_010822-011175 um and that actually had a pretty good result so for
sw04218-B_011612-012356 no there um [vocalized-noise] a lot of them_1 are recycling by trying to compress their trash into the bags as much as they can
sw04218-B_012356-012767 um but for the most part it it's been a big boost to the recycling effort
sw04218-B_012767-013328 it was uh much contested because no one likes to have to pay a dollar fifty a bag
sw04218-B_013482-013932 it it is very steep but it really forces you to think about what you're throwing out
sw04218-B_016520-016636 hum
sw04218-B_016879-017244 well that makes good sense what did he do turn into compose or
sw04218-B_018379-018831 hum yeah we don't have anything like that around here or at least that i am aware of
sw04218-B_018831-019611 but that does sound like it could be beneficial especially in the fall when you've got about twenty bags of leaves out on the side of the road
sw04218-B_020279-021260 um in our area a[s]- a[s]- as i mention earlier if you force people to pay for their trash they're going think twice about what they're throwing out
sw04218-B_021260-021810 they're going to look at everything closely i know i go out of my way to recycle what ever i can
sw04218-B_021810-022148 um part of it is because [vocalized-noise] my environmental
sw04218-B_022148-022481 belief but [vocalized-noise] the main part is uh
sw04218-B_022481-022847 you know avoid paying more than they have to pay
sw04218-B_022847-023626 and uh i think if more people are force to make that type of decision you know as far as the pocket book they're going to recycle
sw04218-B_024521-024720 no i think that
sw04218-B_024720-024905 people uh
sw04218-B_025013-025703 that that that hurts people economically and i don't think that really benefits the overall recycling effort
sw04218-B_025703-026438 um because_1 i know a lot of people just throw out there cans anyway regards weather it's a nickle a dime for a bottle
sw04218-B_026538-027013 um and i'm just not a big believer in that type of text which is how i view it
sw04218-B_028201-028833 what i think you run into a problem there is then you have to bring the cans down to a dep[artment]- a a pick-up center
sw04219-A_000000-000046 [noise]
sw04219-A_000155-000784 at home i have a wide variety we have a lab back home and we also have some horses and
sw04219-A_000784-001441 we have [vocalized-noise] we have one calf but it's not really a pet it's just [laughter] it's a means of food [laughter]
sw04219-A_001441-001718 but my horses and my dogs are my pets
sw04219-A_001820-002266 i- i was raise on a little ranch so i've been raised around horses and dogs my whole life
sw04219-A_002367-002479 Arizona
sw04219-A_003428-003544 yeah
sw04219-A_003544-003707 yeah i know what they are
sw04219-A_003814-003968 oh really
sw04219-A_004878-005037 [laughter-yeah] when i wa[s]-
sw04219-A_005138-005529 when i was growing up i had a German shepherd that was everybody
sw04219-A_005529-005930 my mom brought the dog for herself but the dog didn't like anybody except me
sw04219-A_005930-006453 and i was the only child so me and that dog were just like best friends and
sw04219-A_006553-006851 unfortunately we had to put here out because she got to old but
sw04219-A_006851-007231 i did want any dogs after that and then when i got married
sw04219-A_007231-007458  yes i know a chicken [laughter] 
sw04219-A_007458-007733 that's my you[ng]- [laughter-that's] my oldest son [laughter]
sw04219-A_007733-008337 but um i just dogs and horses are the only kind of pets i really enjoy
sw04219-A_009214-009346 [laughter]
sw04219-A_010425-010559 yeah
sw04219-A_010930-011141 oh i know that feeling [laughter]
sw04219-A_011141-011643 i have to do that with the cocker cause i use to have a cocker to and

sw04219-B_015097-015300 oh okay
sw04219-B_015554-016211 that would be good now we got the peekaboo as a puppy but the Airedale was was pretty much grown

sw04219-B_018094-019292 um the only thing was one she was she was use to being on a ranch a big wide open and then i brought her to our our duplex and we had a fence in back yard
sw04219-B_019292-019920 and so the only problem with her was when you open the gate she was gone
sw04219-B_019920-020725 and this dog if you said sit she'd sit you'd say lay she'd l[ay]- she'd lay you'd tell her go get in your pin she'd go get in her pin
sw04219-B_020725-021752 and she wouldn't come out but if you got her out beyond the fence or beyond the house inside the house she would not come when you called her
sw04219-B_021752-022471 it would just be she's gone she's gone and she's gone that's it she opened up she opened the gate by herself
sw04219-B_022471-022883 you know she would take her nose and she would flip it open and get out
sw04219-B_023142-023333 she was very smart
sw04219-B_023700-023851 uh-huh
sw04219-B_024033-024181 she was just gone

sw04219-B_029651-029806 and um
sw04219-B_029806-029923 so
sw04220-A_000000-000009 [noise]
sw04220-A_000009-000318 o[kay]- o[kay]- okay i'm uh
sw04220-A_000318-000794 well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about tw[elve]- uh twelve thousand people
sw04220-A_000895-001307 and uh it use to be twice as big so
sw04220-A_001307-002069 could've been uh could've been better i'll put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now it's twelve thousand and dropping
sw04220-A_002198-002660 but uh the advantages of a [vocalized-noise] h[ow]- how big is the company you work for
sw04220-A_002765-002937 okay less then a hundred
sw04220-A_002937-003448 some of the same thing still applies i've work for company's uh your size before
sw04220-A_003448-003949 and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is
sw04220-A_003949-004280 like i know a guy who's gone to work for himself
sw04220-A_004280-004383 and
sw04220-A_004484-004781 and uh after a while he became
sw04220-A_004781-004925 isolated
sw04220-A_004925-005440 yeah he was he craved uh [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04220-A_005440-006218 and uh that's one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh
sw04220-A_006218-006488 do you have internet how did you get hooked up to this
sw04220-A_007644-008212 so things like that the internet uh access internet access to a library
sw04220-A_008212-008324 um
sw04220-A_008424-008628 gee how do i say it uh
sw04220-A_012180-012300 uh-huh
sw04220-A_013104-013185 the
sw04220-A_013286-014091 one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is
sw04220-A_014091-014418 is uh access to other people that do the same thing
sw04220-A_014418-015017 if you're the only computer programmer in your company then it's it's it is kind of isolated
sw04220-A_015017-015140 and uh
sw04220-A_015140-015597 so that's one of the advantages uh there are lots of disadvantages of course but uh
sw04220-A_016901-017432 yes and one of the things that that uh tends to happen
sw04220-A_017432-017697 i[n]- in a larger company is uh
sw04220-A_017797-018250 oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh
sw04220-A_018250-018919 to people uh they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size
sw04220-A_018919-020102 uh let see a hundred or so i[t]- i in the past uh had access to people who had access to just anything anyth[ing]- anything and everything was uh was available
sw04220-A_020102-020370 where as in a company like this it's very fragmented
sw04220-A_020370-020553 and i'm i might be
sw04220-A_020701-020834 [vocalized-noise]
sw04220-A_021478-022035 yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing
sw04220-A_022668-022789 [noise]
sw04220-A_025461-025884 i- i have one fear here i i don't know if i push the one button long enough
sw04220-A_025884-026207 do you think you can hear that huh okay because_1 i
sw04220-A_026836-026989 [laughter]
sw04220-A_026989-027689 well in the past they've it you know they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i- i was wondering about that let me try it once more here
sw04220-A_028480-028829 [laughter]
sw04220-A_028829-028915 [noise]
sw04220-A_028915-029053 okay
sw04220-B_000000-000009 [noise]
sw04220-B_000009-000168 okay [vocalized-noise]
sw04220-B_000744-000858 that's big
sw04220-B_001589-001717 uh-huh
sw04220-B_002590-002821 uh less then a hundred people
sw04220-B_002821-004869 [noise]
sw04220-B_004869-005001 uh-huh
sw04220-B_005211-005422 interaction yeah
sw04220-B_005422-006435 [noise]
sw04220-B_006435-007151 uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but we're in the process of
sw04220-B_007151-007494 [noise] establishing our own internet fee[d]- internet feed
sw04220-B_007494-007638 um
sw04220-B_007755-007899 yeah
sw04220-B_008517-009848 well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um
sw04220-B_009848-010594 granted if your s[kill]- your skills were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow t[o]- to uh
sw04220-B_010594-010666 [noise]
sw04220-B_010666-010863 your choices are narrowed but
sw04220-B_010863-011581 i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess you'd call them in a larger company
sw04220-B_011581-011719 um
sw04220-B_011719-012051 i'm a systems engineer and i basically
sw04220-B_012051-012316 design networks um
sw04220-B_012316-012887 so for our end users and our customer i'm you know uh
sw04220-B_012887-013333 i'm pretty much limited to that that's what that's what i do
sw04220-B_014353-014475 um-hum
sw04220-B_015600-016542 yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost any[thing]- getting anything done at all you have to
sw04220-B_016542-016674 uh
sw04220-B_016674-016955 [noise] many layers to go through
sw04220-B_020039-020166 uh-huh
sw04220-B_020280-020393 [noise]
sw04220-B_020393-021550 um-hum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work groups one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right
sw04220-B_021550-021671 [vocalized-noise]
sw04220-B_021972-022066 uh-huh
sw04220-B_022066-022450 we are structured in the uh
sw04220-B_022450-022696 in uh in uh bubble
sw04220-B_022696-022867 uh structure
sw04220-B_022867-023192 we are many different work groups however we work together
sw04220-B_023192-023685 um that's by design we've had the same structure for basically for twenty years
sw04220-B_023685-024215 and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization
sw04220-B_024215-025474 uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facets into play as they're needed so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh
sw04220-B_025781-025964 i think you did
sw04220-B_025964-026118 yeah
sw04220-B_026118-026231 [vocalized-noise]
sw04220-B_026231-027068 i haven't they haven't said that we're out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory [laughter]
sw04220-B_027315-027418 yeah
sw04220-B_027519-028144 well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us i've usually hit the marker to
sw04220-B_028144-028564 um we're not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh
sw04220-B_028564-029005 so we're [vocalized-noise] we're in a we're in a bubble diagram and uh
sw04220-B_029005-029876 that's that's a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say we've had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh
sw04220-B_029876-030016 [noise]
sw04221-A_000000-000281 [noise] so do you do any kind of regular exercise

sw04221-A_006191-006526 yeah that's nice i think it really clears your head a little bit
sw04221-A_007579-007713 uh-huh
sw04221-A_007960-008545 well that's one that's one reason i actually do the walking where i tried other thing is it has a point to it

sw04221-A_012863-013016 ooh
sw04221-A_013423-013840 that's very interesting [vocalized-noise] something probably better for you anyway

sw04221-A_026088-026967 and i know that from the last time what she really like is to have a lot of very hard back rubs during the whole thing and i'm just not ready for it [laughter]
sw04221-A_026967-027437 and i thought well if i can do a bunch of push-up then i should be able to get through these this time
sw04221-A_027437-027855 but uh i have the problem now where we have a son who is almost three
sw04221-A_027855-028332 and he think that it is great fun to try to climb on my back while i'm doing the push-up so
sw04221-A_028501-029142 it's slows me down a little it makes each one a little more meaningful but i can't quit do any [laughter]
sw04221-A_029600-029711 um
sw04221-A_029711-029955 no wh[at]- wh[at]- what are you thinking
sw04221-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04221-B_000193-000538 uh what i do most regular is swim lap swimming
sw04221-B_000538-001186 and um of course i've been indoors a lot lately we've been having some really cold weather here but i prefer swimming outdoor
sw04221-B_001186-001389 um for the
sw04221-B_001389-001862 i think i find the our door atmosphere more inspiring for my exercise really
sw04221-B_001962-002606 yeah yeah and um i just thought i always fill a little more lively um i think when i the times when i do
sw04221-B_002606-003098 or wouldn't having to pass on to the gym maybe to work with weight the weight machine um
sw04221-B_003098-003439 it just a little more spacious yeah like you said claustrophobic
sw04221-B_003439-003628 what do you do for exercise
sw04221-B_003746-003937 [laughter]
sw04221-B_004246-004545 well that a mile a good way each way
sw04221-B_004545-004851 well that's good two miles a day is nothing to [vocalized-noise] at
sw04221-B_004951-006223 oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is walking when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk
sw04221-B_006223-006442 [vocalized-noise]
sw04221-B_006442-006924 yeah and i think one of the um probably i- i think
sw04221-B_006924-007797 that one of the most important thing about [noise] enjoying your exercise and getting it regularly just to have it in your life style like and not be like
sw04221-B_007797-008159 six o'clock at night and well now i've got to go
sw04221-B_008286-008421 oh
sw04221-B_008529-008654 yeah
sw04221-B_008917-009869 yeah and it's finite too you know you eventually reach the bus you don't reach your two miles and say well i really should walk that extra mile [noise] [laughter]
sw04221-B_010239-010388 yeah
sw04221-B_010539-010675 yeah
sw04221-B_010800-010912 very eas[y]-

sw04221-B_011619-011742 yeah
sw04221-B_011742-012447 um one calisthenic type thing that i i feel like i i feel like i have gotten to do and eventually with out having to think about it do is
sw04221-B_012447-012934 just squatting down when i going to pick something up instead of bending over at the waist
sw04221-B_012934-013539 and um i can i think i fill like i can already tell the difference in my thighs just i have a little more definition
sw04221-B_013539-013687 yeah and i
sw04221-B_013787-014515 yeah and that what that what started it with a little bit of back trouble i was having and of course i didn't want to do leg lift or anything [laughter]
sw04221-B_014648-014841 [laughter]
sw04221-B_014841-015058 that's right [laughter] that's right [laughter]
sw04221-B_015812-015919 yeah
sw04221-B_016021-016168 oh yeah
sw04221-B_016268-016403 yes [noise]
sw04221-B_016403-016750 [vocalized-noise] together i'm just going to ignore that call waiting if you heard it
sw04221-B_016750-016882 [laughter]
sw04221-B_017413-017520 [noise]
sw04221-B_017520-017953 that would defiantly fall in the unnatural category [laughter]
sw04221-B_018194-018324 yeah
sw04221-B_018425-018501 [noise] no
sw04221-B_018501-019334 this girlfriend of mines got a pretty flat stomach not i don't really but i don't i was asking her because_1 she does not she's one of those who just doesn't exercise you know
sw04221-B_019334-020054 and um but she said she you know just you know hold her stomach in all day i mean you know just constantly holds it in all day
sw04221-B_020294-021117 well i'm sure it would be good for your back it seems like it might im[pede]- im[pede]- you know impede your breathing a little bit in less [noise] really use to it
sw04221-B_021117-021298 what do you think
sw04221-B_021852-022052 oh really [noise]
sw04221-B_022382-022696 yeah i- i was in it for a while um
sw04221-B_022696-023432 when i was in high school i took um choral and you have to hold your you know just to regulate your breathing [vocalized-noise] you had
sw04221-B_023432-023906 yeah but i found like the top half of my stomach above above my belly button was
sw04221-B_023906-024350 getting you know was always tone but then the the trouble spot below the belly button
sw04221-B_024350-025257 never never quit tone you know [laughter] and you know that was the part i was concern about so i just blew it all off [laughter-all] [laughter-together] [laughter]
sw04221-B_025699-025864 oh really
sw04221-B_026050-026195 oh
sw04221-B_026684-026815 uh-huh
sw04221-B_026918-027048 [laughter]
sw04221-B_028031-028330 [laughter]
sw04221-B_028330-028860 well that could you know slow you down a little bit it's just that extra resistance and [laughter]
sw04221-B_029009-029155 [laughter]
sw04221-B_029155-029638 um do you do any exercises for your hand the little muscle in your hand
sw04221-B_029845-029955 [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-A_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04222-A_000200-000553 hi um i'm Ralph um Cin[cinnati]- Cincinnati
sw04222-A_001323-001854 yeah um weather we pay too much or uh maybe we got back what we
sw04222-A_001854-002228 uh because_1 we got i guess to die for what we paid
sw04222-A_002582-002716 okay
sw04222-A_003009-003309 um let's see i guess we got one
sw04222-A_003309-003359 oh
sw04222-A_003359-003591 [noise]
sw04222-A_003591-003706 okay
sw04222-A_003706-003832 um
sw04222-A_003957-004558 well let's see i guess uh since i'm in the process of filling them out i guess i kind of fill like uh
sw04222-A_004558-004702 um
sw04222-A_004702-005158 it's it is too much but i don't know what i uh cut out i guess
sw04222-A_009911-010042 um-hum
sw04222-A_010911-011013 [noise]
sw04222-A_013411-013543 um-hum
sw04222-A_016108-016225 hum
sw04222-A_017387-017503 hum
sw04222-A_017503-018152 that's interesting but uh i guess that's uh something that happen when there is so many people involved
sw04222-A_018152-018514 each one fill like they [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-A_018514-018743 take a responsibility for
sw04222-A_018850-018969 um
sw04222-A_018969-019314 making sure that thing work the way there suppose to or something
sw04222-A_019314-019687 but um i never really thought of it that way but
sw04222-A_019687-020097 i guess there [vocalized-noise] seems like their some programs that are more valuable
sw04222-A_020097-020363 and other that be [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-A_020363-020590 that be useful to have more uh
sw04222-A_020590-020964 sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making
sw04222-A_020964-021081 [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-A_022654-022816 [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-A_022816-022911 um
sw04222-A_023051-023676 i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one
sw04222-A_023676-023893 solutions where they actually
sw04222-A_023893-024416 maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where i'm from but it's
sw04222-A_024416-024662 i think it's rare to actually no
sw04222-A_024762-025855 like you can influence what uh your representative is really doing because_1 if you know if even if there's even a lot of writing campaign chances are there'll be a lot of letters on both sides of the issue
sw04222-A_025855-026280 particularly if if it is a controversial bill or something like that
sw04222-A_028499-028627 um-hum
sw04222-A_029442-029573 um-hum
sw04222-B_000000-000167 Cathy i'm in Boston
sw04222-B_000517-000681 hi Ralph
sw04222-B_000681-001340 um uh th[e]- the machine said that the topic was uh taxes
sw04222-B_002195-002642 okay well i'm i'm ready anytime that you want to start
sw04222-B_003713-003954 oh yeah go head
sw04222-B_005222-005596 no i- i know what you mean we're in the process of doing ours and
sw04222-B_005697-006109 it it it does seems [noise] like a lot uh
sw04222-B_006109-006397 i wish i had a better feeling for
sw04222-B_006397-007433 uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here
sw04222-B_007433-008356 it it it's hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is
sw04222-B_008356-009007 is like Monopoly money it it's so larger you don't really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car
sw04222-B_009007-009969 you get a better feeling for for what's going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands
sw04222-B_009969-010097 but uh
sw04222-B_010097-010262 i [vocalized-noise]
sw04222-B_010262-010449 Americans in general well
sw04222-B_010549-011834 i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually don't mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out
sw04222-B_011834-012594 because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually
sw04222-B_012594-013463 generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i don't believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system
sw04222-B_013463-014114 but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that
sw04222-B_014114-014603 after a while it becomes to easy an[d]- an[d]- and people uh
sw04222-B_014603-015529 say well oh sure well we we haven't plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need that's okay we will just let it go and
sw04222-B_015529-016151 and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars an[d]-
sw04222-B_016151-017441 so there there's no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset
sw04222-B_017441-019609 [noise]
sw04222-B_019609-019696 huh
sw04222-B_021006-021986 oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but
sw04222-B_021986-022282 but what sort of involvement uh
sw04222-B_022282-022808 would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that
sw04222-B_026188-026354 huh yeah
sw04222-B_026354-027163 well here it here in Massachusetts i mean we have a just like the rest of the country we have a a server budget problem and
sw04222-B_027163-027524 and often here uh people
sw04222-B_027524-027938 are are angry about their taxes being so high
sw04222-B_027938-028540 and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state
sw04222-B_028540-029510 and many people fall back on well there's money there's a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well it's all out there somewhere
sw04222-B_029510-029895 and the the the next step is to identify where [vocalized-noise]
sw04223-A_000000-001359 uh in Pittsburgh we have just recently in about like last year uh in the fall they started uh a blue bag an[d]- and blue container uh sort of program where you know is that the same for you
sw04223-A_001783-002483 yeah it's curbside and also uh we have a dumpster in the apartment building where i live and there's a blue dumpster too
sw04223-A_002483-002985 when you go to the supermarket they give you uh plastic blue plastic bags
sw04223-A_002985-004049 but i don't think it works out so well where i live uh i'm in in the university area uh w[ell]- because the blue dumpster gets full uh with other things as well so
sw04223-A_004049-004785 i know that the they reject the uh recyclables when they're mixed with other trash so it probably doesn't work out too well
sw04223-A_005439-006556 yeah b[ut]- it but also uh it this seems kind of it's kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like it's it's as re[cycle]- as convenient as it could be
sw04223-A_006556-007278 but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling d[umpster]- bin right next to it
sw04223-A_007739-008851 yeah but it is pretty nice though that the supermarket i'm not sure whether i mentioned this uh they give you the the the blue plastic bags uh al[ong]- when you when you buy your groceries and you just use those to recycle
sw04223-A_009318-010042 well right now and i was just going to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but it's um
sw04223-A_010042-010960 bottles and cans and they've just added paper to it but what i'm not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them
sw04223-A_013577-013772 right i'm not sure
sw04223-A_013994-014805 yeah i th[ink]- i think uh i think you can put them all in into the same bin i'm li[ke]- i like i said i have been separating them_1 just because i'm not sure
sw04223-A_014805-016004 uh but i'm i know that the one restriction they have is that uh you're you're not supposed to y[ou]- y[ou]- well obviously you have to clean out anything that had food in it or you know whatever you're not supposed to put things that could have been contaminated
sw04223-A_016141-017114 uh n[o]- i don't soak off the labels [laughter] because that that would be a pretty big pain i- i- i'm like i i'm not quite sure about the exact policy uh
sw04223-A_017114-017797 because i thought i had uh something laying around uh that specified what the policy was but i could never find it
sw04223-A_017797-018596 [laughter] so i i mean i'm s[ure]- i'm sure that it doesn't take that much to to remove the the labels it's a[t]- least doing something um
sw04223-A_018596-019950 but i know i mean i[f]- if i did there all the rest of the people in the apartment building that i that i i live in probably wouldn't because_1 because there's just just a matter of education it's it's just not there
sw04223-A_020169-020346 oh that's true
sw04223-A_021171-021381 right well that's
sw04223-A_021711-022871 right well what they do uh i- i- i don't know anyone that uh has has had had this happen to them because no one that i know has a home in the recycling areas yet
sw04223-A_022871-023690 but uh if you walk along after garbage pickup day uh some people will have their bags still sitting out there with a little note on it
sw04223-A_023690-024604 which i've never read one but i'm assuming is probably telling them_1 telling them why they couldn't pickup that particular uh bag but
sw04223-A_025024-025146 um-hum
sw04223-A_025485-026982 you know what though i bet if they they could certainly just stick the the rental company with with the uh with the bill or or whatever and the[y]- just give the rental have the rental company have more responsibility because they're really
sw04223-A_026982-027857 in that respect they're the only people who could have a[ny]- you know any control over over it o[ver]- over educating their tenants or you know
sw04223-A_028944-029113 yeah [noise]
sw04223-B_000000-000062 [noise]
sw04223-B_001083-001204 yeah
sw04223-B_001360-001859 um well we just have to ha[ve]- put it out in a separate container i[s]- is that a curbside pickup then
sw04223-B_002217-002326 um-hum
sw04223-B_002465-002549 yeah
sw04223-B_002891-003027 oh okay
sw04223-B_004505-005489 yeah a[s]- a[s]- a[s]- as a matter well it's a matter of people starting to respect it and understanding what it's for and understanding that it actually does help everybody if they all recycle
sw04223-B_006489-006615 yeah
sw04223-B_007208-007804 yeah you j[ust]- you just need to uh keep a separate container in the apartment or whatever and separate there
sw04223-B_008447-008557 um-hum
sw04223-B_008798-009385 so is is that mixed all recyclables do you or is it only uh cans and bottles and stuff
sw04223-B_010742-010885 oh okay
sw04223-B_010885-011485 yeah N[ew]- New Jersey has since New Jersey has had a major waste problem for a couple of years now
sw04223-B_011485-012444 um right now at least in the town i'm in they collect all recyclables paper you know newspaper and junk mail in one bag
sw04223-B_012444-013633 and then mix together cans bottles and that's both aluminum and bimetal cans as well as uh plastics like your soda bottles laundry detergent bottles that type of thing
sw04223-B_013633-014077 and you just put it put it all together into one bin it's nice and convenient
sw04223-B_015742-015897 right
sw04223-B_015897-016201 d[o]- do you have to soak off all the labels too
sw04223-B_017697-017908 [laughter] yeah
sw04223-B_019303-019405 yeah
sw04223-B_019718-020226 well i[t]- it it's that and also in the apartment building you don't have the fear of being caught
sw04223-B_020226-021257 y[eah]- oh in New Jersey they will or they at least they can i i haven't really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash
sw04223-B_021257-021796 but whereas if you're living in an apartment building there's no way of tracing back who put in what
sw04223-B_023617-023773 yeah
sw04223-B_024451-025564 yeah the[y]- they'll do they'll do that here too if uh you put out let's say your glass and cans in a paper bag they'll put a big orange sticker on it saying put it out in a plastic bag or a separate container
sw04223-B_026330-026485 yeah
sw04223-B_027702-029027 yeah the the the problem with that is it's such a long way it doesn't ever get back to the tenants that this is something you really need to do because even if they do a slight rent increase it's so small and over such a long period of time that no one notices
sw04223-B_029027-029509 yeah the the only other way to uh make it a little more um
sw04223-B_029509-029847 useful for people to do is what they had down in Atlanta
sw04224-A_000000-001386 [noise] hey um generally i am m[ajority]- m[ajority]- majority of the news that i get is from uh AM radio in the mornings but going to and from work i we have like uh a a WCBS station which which just kind of fires through all the top topics
sw04224-A_001386-001802 how do you uh how do you generally find out what's going on in the world
sw04224-A_002537-002778 [laughter]
sw04224-A_003119-003264 oh okay
sw04224-A_003733-003866 okay
sw04224-A_004757-004926 [laughter]
sw04224-A_004926-005053 you're behind [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-A_005053-005180 yeah
sw04224-A_005809-006467 i used to have uh i used to have cable and uh the thing that i really miss um
sw04224-A_006467-006813 since uh since i lost cable and there's that not that much on there that i miss but uh
sw04224-A_006813-008024 Headline News was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the top topics were in in like a half hour span and in Around the World in Thirty Minutes i think was their big thing
sw04224-A_008024-009394 and the other thing i used to i uh i miss is CNN um CNN used to go a little bit more in depth um you would get uh like Crossfire you would get you know different different perspectives from usually from like the left and the right liberal and conservative
sw04224-A_009394-009683 arguing the various uh
sw04224-A_009683-009870 [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-A_009870-010420 i think Patrick Buchanan who's now running for president used to be the uh conservative side for that
sw04224-A_010970-011293 i can't think of the name of the guy that represented the left
sw04224-A_011939-012056 yeah
sw04224-A_012331-012452 um-hum
sw04224-A_012697-012939 yeah that's actually on a network isn't it
sw04224-A_013143-013357 that's exactly right
sw04224-A_013357-014349 and and uh see because_1 i've run into that a couple of times on accident and uh ended up watching it for like extended periods of time but that's how i get most of my news is is
sw04224-A_014959-016309 i tried listening to NPR but uh uh i mean in the mornings i don't in the mornings i want i want a l[ittle]- i want you know the the yeah the USA Today feed you know [laughter] give me a couple of color graphs and uh and i'll be happy
sw04224-A_016450-016548 uh
sw04224-A_016895-017040 um-hum
sw04224-A_017873-018009 um-hum
sw04224-A_018145-018680 the only thing that scares me about um the way i do news is
sw04224-A_018680-019237 getting it from like these pre digested sources you know like the like the
sw04224-A_019237-019794 typically what i've heard maybe it's just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that like uh
sw04224-A_019794-020887 the news on TV and what not tends to be um more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts
sw04224-A_021413-021568 true too
sw04224-A_023343-023497 um-hum
sw04224-A_023885-024011 [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-A_025134-025293 um-hum
sw04224-A_025604-025754 yeah
sw04224-A_026503-026658 [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-A_026813-027906 but see i think you and i perhaps i i think uh well i get the feeling that that you and i perhaps might might take the time to try and figure out exactly what really happened as opposed to what they're telling us even though they maybe close
sw04224-A_027906-028721 but i wonder how much of the rest of America takes the time to to stop with just the the straight spoon fed you know
sw04224-A_028851-029069 [laughter]
sw04224-A_029069-029917 yeah yeah well especially when you figure what a third of the people that bother to vote always vote Republican a third of the people that a[lways]- that bother to vote always vote Democrat an[d]-
sw04224-B_000000-000062 [noise]
sw04224-B_001340-001486 um-hum
sw04224-B_001802-002022 oh i don't know
sw04224-B_002022-002653 oh i listen in the car but my commute is only only a mile so [laughter]
sw04224-B_002653-003403 uh but uh you know i have the uh radio wake me up in the morning so i get i get some headlines there
sw04224-B_003528-003760 i read the usenet news
sw04224-B_003916-004112 uh
sw04224-B_004112-004575 really i'm not getting the good quality news that i want
sw04224-B_004575-004818 and i- i bought a TV last year
sw04224-B_004818-005113 but but i don't really watch it
sw04224-B_005251-005526 oh and i don't i don't believe [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-B_005526-005809 i don't get any in depth stuff
sw04224-B_006731-006890 [laughter]
sw04224-B_009486-009987 oh Crossfire yeah i saw that a couple of times
sw04224-B_010380-011051 who did they have i've my friends who watch CNN all the time they like knew these guys
sw04224-B_011272-011664 yeah uh i saw the uh
sw04224-B_011664-012056 McLaughlin had a similar type of a program on
sw04224-B_012056-012442 i guess Buchanan retired from that also
sw04224-B_012442-012762 that that's a good show i like that one a lot
sw04224-B_012896-013201 yeah it's on i guess it was on PBS for a while
sw04224-B_013201-013356 probably still is
sw04224-B_014012-014180 yeah
sw04224-B_014180-015000 yeah P[BS]- P[BS]- PB[S]- uh you know MacNeil Lehrer or uh NPR usually have some decent in depth stuff
sw04224-B_015599-015751 headlines
sw04224-B_015876-016049 [laughter]
sw04224-B_016202-016446 oh God i hate that
sw04224-B_016446-016970 yeah we have uh you know the local newspaper is is pretty weak
sw04224-B_016970-017156 but uh
sw04224-B_017343-017950 and i once in a every once in a while like every six months or every three months i read the Times
sw04224-B_017950-018158 the Times is pretty good
sw04224-B_020992-021485 well not only that but it's so little there's no background
sw04224-B_021485-022781 uh you know i rely a lot to tell you the truth on uh you know when i was growing up i learned geography i'd read the Times a lot so you know and e[very]- every
sw04224-B_022781-023405 day there'd be an article on some country you know what's doing in that country this week
sw04224-B_023405-023977 you know because_1 there's enough countries that uh you know there'd be something interesting happening
sw04224-B_023977-024432 pretty much and i got a pretty good feel for
sw04224-B_024683-025237 you know and um that and taking some economics classes you get a pretty good feel for how the world works
sw04224-B_025237-025669 so when you hear a story then you say well what aren't they telling you
sw04224-B_025669-026491 and then you start conjecturing and that's where i hate i hate it because you know i can guess what's happening but i don't know the real truth
sw04224-B_026491-026853 and uh they just they leave out so much
sw04224-B_027694-027877 y[eah]-
sw04224-B_027877-028053 [vocalized-noise]
sw04224-B_028661-028906 huh you can stop wondering
sw04224-B_028906-029111 they don't care
sw04224-B_029234-029334 [vocalized-noise]
sw04225-A_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04225-A_000039-000332 okay well are you still there
sw04225-A_000332-001474 yeah uh we got real good benefits where i'm at although they're becoming uh less and less every year so that they're taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits
sw04225-A_001474-001742 do you guys uh have full coverage where you're at
sw04225-A_004146-004293 [noise]
sw04225-A_005070-006067 yeah yeah i- i i agree uh y[ou]- you pay a lot of money into them_1 and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh
sw04225-A_006067-007449 you know their their minimum amounts or something like that they've always got these uh these plans set up where they they've got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor it's always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what they'll pay for
sw04225-A_007449-007862 and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh
sw04225-A_007862-008644 the the pri[mary]- or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesn't really keep up with what they
sw04225-A_008644-008845 actually have so it's kind of a
sw04225-A_008845-009209 they [vocalized-noise] they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh
sw04225-A_009209-009925 other thing about Pratt's benefits uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that i'd ever had
sw04225-A_009925-011025 and since then you know they've for the st[aggering]- skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh they've really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company
sw04225-A_012169-012335 wow
sw04225-A_013198-013390 oh you have soda
sw04225-A_014456-014718 well that's pretty good benefit then
sw04225-A_015638-015804 yeah
sw04225-A_015804-016706 well i d[idn't]- i guess i never really thought about that as a benefit we we can get up and go to our cafeteria and you know and pay to get something to drink but i guess i guess that is kind of a benefit to just to have a place to go do that
sw04225-A_016819-017511 yeah we we have a real nice cafeteria we can go to that anytime during the day and it's always it is always nice to go down there and get a coffee or a tea or a juice
sw04225-A_017673-017905 yeah that that's that's always good
sw04225-A_017905-018112 uh do you guys have like a savings plan
sw04225-A_018550-019225 uh our uh we we're really lucky in that respect our for every dollar we put in Pratt Whitney'll match us sixty cents
sw04225-A_019225-019747 that th[at]- th[at]- that's real good and that's that's one reason why i really like that
sw04225-A_020483-020741 does it depend on how many years you've been there
sw04225-A_020879-022003 wow that's really something uh at Pratt it's uh if you're there eight years or less it's two weeks and as soon as you get your eight year in you get three weeks and then when you get uh fifteen years you get another week so
sw04225-A_022003-022648 you know a guy who's been ou[t]- been out there for like twenty five thirty years get about uh you know five weeks vacation paid a year
sw04225-A_023303-023451 oh ok[ay]-
sw04225-A_023982-024109 ah
sw04225-A_024402-025086 how are your h[ow]- h[ow]- how important is that you know your benefits when you sound like you've uh done some job hopping you've had more than one job then
sw04225-A_025210-025628 oh okay with th[at]- how ma[ny]- how much time did you spend with each one
sw04225-A_025628-025839 oh okay
sw04225-A_026055-026193 okay
sw04225-A_026379-026491 wow
sw04225-A_026702-026990 okay and and that's up in in Pittsburgh you said
sw04225-A_026990-027155 okay
sw04225-A_027650-027797 hm
sw04225-A_028399-028831 ah that's another that's another benefit i forgot to mention we have flex time
sw04225-A_028831-029001 you also have that
sw04225-A_029001-029239 that's one of my favorite benefits uh
sw04225-A_029239-029653 ever since i've been ever since i graduated from school in eighty six
sw04225-A_029653-029786 every job i've had has always
sw04225-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04225-B_000255-000419 yeah i'm here
sw04225-B_001666-001932 yeah well we do um it's
sw04225-B_001932-002873 it's funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs
sw04225-B_002873-003184 in general yeah our benefits uh
sw04225-B_003184-003883 we we have a choice between an H[MOs]- between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield
sw04225-B_003883-004056 and um
sw04225-B_004056-005078 seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible
sw04225-B_005078-005201 they're
sw04225-B_007421-007598 yeah
sw04225-B_009040-009263 yeah absolutely
sw04225-B_010965-011591 yeah it's expensive uh it's very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh
sw04225-B_011591-012204 if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free drinks free beverages
sw04225-B_012204-012913 and uh that's really popular that's v[ery]- uh a lot of people like that where we have uh all kinds of uh
sw04225-B_012913-013064 uh well
sw04225-B_013064-013728 here we call it pop i guess on the east coast you'd call it soda and uh juices and
sw04225-B_013728-014620 oh coffee and tea and uh uh spring water hot and cold and soups and that's
sw04225-B_014620-014954 yeah it's very nice uh often if you're
sw04225-B_014954-015963 just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the kitchen and uh make yourself a cup of tea a fresh cup of tea herbal tea or whatever and
sw04225-B_016684-016966 yeah oh definitely it gives you a chance
sw04225-B_017456-017716 sure absolutely and get your and give your mind a rest
sw04225-B_018095-018632 uh well the company offers a 401K but they don't contribute at all
sw04225-B_018632-018758 so
sw04225-B_019173-019303 so that is great
sw04225-B_019692-019933 yeah that that that is a very nice benefit
sw04225-B_019933-020510 one of the things that we have lacking is the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year
sw04225-B_020680-020952 no it's just across the board
sw04225-B_022508-023576 yeah well in the technology industry it's such a young industry that there aren't very many people that have been in it for a very long time so they don't have the same uh
sw04225-B_023576-024058 scale although at other jobs i've had i['ve]- i've had three weeks vacation
sw04225-B_024058-024386 so uh so stripping down to two was uh
sw04225-B_025011-025290 uh three i've had three
sw04225-B_025546-025702 very short
sw04225-B_025702-026105 the first the first job with the first two were a year and a half each
sw04225-B_026105-026413 and uh and after that i worked for two years
sw04225-B_026413-026704 at the company i'm at where i plan to stay for a while
sw04225-B_026929-027047 that's right
sw04225-B_027192-027685 that's right but you know in the the c[omputer]- the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general
sw04225-B_027685-027984 i think than other industries um
sw04225-B_027984-028645 in terms of uh flex hours and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place
sw04225-B_028793-028923 yeah
sw04225-B_028923-029078 that's right
sw04226-A_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04226-A_000036-000133 so
sw04226-A_000133-000333 [laughter]
sw04226-A_000333-000602 uh how do you feel about capital punishment
sw04226-A_001966-002091 huh
sw04226-A_003064-003609 yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived [laughter-i] [laughter-just]
sw04226-A_003609-003812 i don't know so
sw04226-A_003812-004295 i i personally uh even though
sw04226-A_004295-005056 i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever a[pplying]- applying capital punishment to anyone
sw04226-A_005056-006232 um because_1 i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes
sw04226-A_006232-006845 but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence
sw04226-A_006845-008031 and uh there's just no reason to justify killing a person a[nd]- you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify uh killing someone
sw04226-A_008031-009048 if you believe that killing is wrong y[ou]- you might as well apply that to you know even that s[tays]- stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel
sw04226-A_009660-009785 yeah
sw04226-A_010701-010855 we[ll]-
sw04226-A_011024-011894 it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and
sw04226-A_011894-012591 you know i- i- i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but
sw04226-A_012591-012708 uh
sw04226-A_012708-012837 yeah
sw04226-A_013402-013552 oh yeah
sw04226-A_013702-014485 but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it
sw04226-A_014485-015038 for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but
sw04226-A_015038-015963 if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media
sw04226-A_015963-016245 yeah so i you know
sw04226-A_016245-016556 uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess
sw04226-A_017825-017958 uh-huh
sw04226-A_018555-018689 uh-huh
sw04226-A_018915-019118 well there have to be because
sw04226-A_019118-019344 uh uh i don't know there's like
sw04226-A_019344-019878 well i don't know the numbers but i mean there's at least dozens of capital punishments every year
sw04226-A_019878-020137 from what i that's what i think it is
sw04226-A_020137-020453 and you know you don't hear about all of those
sw04226-A_021669-021814 uh-huh
sw04226-A_023833-024161 right yeah i do[n't]- i don't know either
sw04226-A_024161-024303 so
sw04226-A_025032-025157 right
sw04226-A_025282-025400 yeah
sw04226-A_026202-026399 they're against capital punishment
sw04226-A_026399-026533 oh okay
sw04226-A_026892-026988 we[ll]-
sw04226-A_026988-027407 aren't do a lot of coun[tries]- countries not have capital punishment
sw04226-A_027764-028035 that'd be interesting to find out who doesn't
sw04226-A_028306-028399 yeah
sw04226-A_029101-029232 right
sw04226-B_000000-000021 [noise]
sw04226-B_000021-000120 so
sw04226-B_000120-000290 [laughter] w[hat]-
sw04226-B_000596-000840 uh tough question i mean it it's
sw04226-B_000840-001932 i was actually kind of thinking about it the other day someone was talking about it how uh a person who takes someone else's life he was saying should should not deserve the right to ha[ve]- to keep their own life
sw04226-B_001932-002444 it's kind of it's it's it's a really you know it's a moral dilemma i don't know um
sw04226-B_002444-003091 i think that i- i forget what the law is in my state i mean my home state i'm from i'm from Maryland
sw04226-B_003091-003251 and i just
sw04226-B_003454-003591 [laughter]
sw04226-B_008973-009617 yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to uh eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing
sw04226-B_009617-009733 maybe
sw04226-B_009908-010122 i don't know it's like uh
sw04226-B_010122-010692 you kind of wonder do you want someone like Jeffrey Dahmer alive or not
sw04226-B_010692-010993 oh or or Charles Manson
sw04226-B_011482-011627 yeah
sw04226-B_012576-012759 i don't see it happening [laughter]
sw04226-B_012759-013151 like i don't see Charles Manson i think he'll never get out he's
sw04226-B_013151-013608 he's probably going to be up for parole in a year or so but he's not going to it's not going to happen
sw04226-B_013787-013905 [noise]
sw04226-B_015918-016089 this could be
sw04226-B_016703-017302 yeah i i st[ill]- i think even if they aren't in the media i don't know if it would happen unless maybe it was
sw04226-B_017302-017575 uh bureaucracy that got pushed aside
sw04226-B_017575-017848 and someone said ah we'll let them_1 out
sw04226-B_017848-018598 i don't know someone i don't know i mean i guess there's are probably are small time serial killers that you don't hear about
sw04226-B_018598-018846 something um
sw04226-B_019001-019147 [noise]
sw04226-B_020390-021358 i don't know um because_1 i think i don't think they actually execute prisoners v[ery]- too often because_1 there's i mean there's death row
sw04226-B_021358-022136 there's a lot of time where uh prisoners are kept on death row for a long time i mean yeah there was uh Ted Bundy
sw04226-B_022136-022845 there was uh i mean there was such an outcry to um to execute him because_1 it i mean he was the the crimes he did were just so heinous
sw04226-B_022845-022992 um
sw04226-B_023140-023987 now i i think that there's it's just such a controversial thing that it doesn't happen too often i'm not so i i d[on't]- at least at least i don't hear about it that often
sw04226-B_024553-024680 um
sw04226-B_024680-025042 nah i don't think there's been an execution in my state in a long time that i know of
sw04226-B_025298-025453 and i know that like
sw04226-B_025453-025573 um
sw04226-B_025573-026458 uh one of the one of the things that that's that's one of the things that the that Amnesty International is against in the United States is capital punishment yeah
sw04226-B_026458-027041 of any of any kind so that's o[ne]- the one thing they have against the United States one of their gripes

sw04226-B_029113-029246 i guess
sw04226-B_029408-029642 i kind of waver i guess sometimes
sw04226-B_029642-029749 it's li[ke]-
sw04226-B_029749-029930 someone like Jeffrey Dahmer you kind of wan[t]-

sw04227-A_012394-012532 but uh
sw04227-A_012532-012788 when you come in the house and he
sw04227-A_012788-013082 he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at
sw04227-A_013082-013228 [laughter]
sw04227-A_013228-013445 [laughter]
sw04227-A_013445-013536 oh

sw04227-A_016653-017076 good uh way to protect your house too when you're gone
sw04227-A_017203-017998 you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody r[ings]- knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps people away
sw04227-A_017998-018329 they think twice about breaking in [laughter]
sw04227-A_018329-019037 [laughter]
sw04227-A_019037-019238 uh
sw04227-A_019238-019668 but our little our little kitty he she uses uh

sw04227-A_023572-024341 yeah we[ll]- well see at first they thought that the cat was a a boy
sw04227-A_024341-024829 so they called her Oscar until the found out she was a girl so they just called her Oscar Anne
sw04227-A_024829-024965 [laughter]
sw04227-A_025116-025254 so that's
sw04227-A_025396-026074 uh that's the name there and uh how we got the dogs was we were stationed in England and

sw04227-B_002277-002443 really
sw04227-B_002443-002960 we[ll]- i've just the opposite i've got a Pomeranian he probably weighs about five
sw04227-B_002960-003195 he thinks he's a little man
sw04227-B_003195-003572 he's a little he presses around and struts
sw04227-B_003572-003909 but i don't have a cat though that might be a little bit too much
sw04227-B_003909-004170 do you keep the dog and the cat both in the house
sw04227-B_004170-004406 yeah they get along

sw04227-B_011330-011452 we[ll]- that's good
sw04227-B_012246-012491 [laughter]
sw04227-B_012997-013348 [laughter-thinks] i think that Brian would probably do the same thing
sw04227-B_013495-014205 well i've heard that um pets are like t[o]- to people that are sick or to older people that they're have like calming effects on them_1
sw04227-B_014454-014802 especially_1 i guess if they have like high blood pressure or
sw04227-B_014802-015700 um like heart conditions it just kind of helps to have a little or a dog or a cat or something around just to lavish the attention on it kind of calms them
sw04227-B_016235-016408 yeah
sw04227-B_017042-017224 uh that's true
sw04227-B_017921-018049 yeah
sw04227-B_018355-018484 um
sw04227-B_018484-018904 try[ing]- there's something i was going to tell you and i forgot just totally went out the window
sw04227-B_020870-021139 and then [laughter-y'all] decided to keep it
sw04227-B_021139-021467 isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something
sw04227-B_021467-021694 [laughter]
sw04227-B_021920-022040 oh
sw04227-B_022040-022588 well do you have names that are appropriate with more or less how you found them_1 or how you got them_1 or anything or
sw04227-B_022588-022756 no
sw04227-B_023491-023851 Oscar Anne well that's a new one
sw04227-B_024737-024915 oh i see
sw04227-B_026520-026690 um-hum
sw04227-B_028138-028582 Lord did you have a problem naming um coming up with names for them_1
sw04227-B_029062-029597 it took me like three weeks to name mine because_1 i kept saying well i want to find a name that fits
sw04227-B_029597-029891 and i actually had for a couple of days had started calling
sw04228-A_000000-000261 [noise] kind of dream car do you want to buy [laughter]
sw04228-A_001158-001277 uh-huh
sw04228-A_003283-003581 hm that's interesting
sw04228-A_003581-004251 yeah uh reliability and an economy you know if you drive a lot b[ut]-
sw04228-A_005213-005515 in real dollars yeah
sw04228-A_006511-007101 yeah that's true but i think that's really artif[icial]- you know that's unfortunate it's un[fortunate]- it's
sw04228-A_007101-007525 it should probably uh taxed or something to
sw04228-A_007525-007698 limit that
sw04228-A_010951-011072 huh
sw04228-A_011072-012011 but uh [laughter-getting] back to the topic i guess i guess kind of pushed i guess i kind of pushed us off to the side [laughter] supposed to be talking about cars not
sw04228-A_012259-012545 yeah well um i don't know
sw04228-A_012768-013512 uh you know i guess the uh i was l[ike]- interested in like the uh the new Honda VX
sw04228-A_013512-014359 has the uh lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower
sw04228-A_014359-015097 and uh boosts your uh mileage by like uh almost ten twenty miles per gallon
sw04228-A_015589-015800 almost in the fifties
sw04228-A_016349-016906 well you can you know like a well Civic is is like a Corolla or something it it's
sw04228-A_016906-017848 it's it's not as well hey it's in some ways it's not quite as big as a Taurus but then it's not too much smaller either um
sw04228-A_017848-017995 but
sw04228-A_018491-018796 no dreams for a sports car of any kind
sw04228-A_019433-019627 yeah yeah
sw04228-A_020043-020153 [laughter]
sw04228-A_020153-020499 so you'd rather have [vocalized-noise] a one of those big vans
sw04228-A_021484-021597 uh-huh
sw04228-A_023103-023433 what do you have a station wagon or a regular [vocalized-noise]
sw04228-A_023683-024126 uh-huh do you have those uh split seats that fold down
sw04228-A_024126-024520 from the uh the trunk that's a good innovation
sw04228-A_024848-025096 then you could put a lot more in
sw04228-A_025900-025996 huh
sw04228-A_025996-026144 -[th]at's interesting
sw04228-A_026475-026568 [laughter]
sw04228-A_026568-026953 are you one to read manuals before using something
sw04228-A_028193-028860 oh yeah i guess so hey it's a it's a substitute for something [laughter] wanting to drive
sw04228-A_028860-029350 hm
sw04228-A_029350-029692 oh i don't know i i i i don't know i like um
sw04228-A_029692-029818 i- i like those
sw04228-B_000000-000029 [noise]
sw04228-B_000225-001241 oh gee do i want to buy i don't know that i really [laughter] want a whole lot more o[ther]- other than what i got i just uh got a car about uh fourteen fift[een]- fifteen months ago now
sw04228-B_001241-001471 uh i bought a Taurus um
sw04228-B_001471-002097 the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations
sw04228-B_002097-003351 i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you can't get all three today you [laughter-got] got to give up one or the other
sw04228-B_004167-005439 um-hum yeah the the fuel economy is not a big factor uh especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but but
sw04228-B_005439-006026 yeah in in real dollars it's just not not much of a factor um you know the uh
sw04228-B_006026-006648 what your ma call its it does it's it's less than insurance i think [laughter] for example
sw04228-B_007409-008660 well i d[on't]- that's that would be that would be reasonable i think i'm i'm wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well it's a a nonrenewable resource uh
sw04228-B_008660-009518 but i don't know there's lots of nonren[ewable]- -[non]renewable resources that one could tax just because they're nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground um
sw04228-B_009518-010487 i don't know if if there really is that justification but uh it certainly is is more more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to
sw04228-B_010487-011201 build roads than it is to have them_1 t[ake]- take tolls which means you got to stop and means that
sw04228-B_011342-011466 excuse me
sw04228-B_011855-012808 yeah but there's nobody that checks you see [laughter-we] [laughter-could] [laughter-actually] talk about anything but um if you i mean bring u[s]- bring us back to the topic if you'd like
sw04228-B_013405-013548 um-hum
sw04228-B_013915-014051 um-hum
sw04228-B_014978-015629 hm so what would you get uh you know wh[at]- what are the what are the EPA fuel economy numbers
sw04228-B_015748-015875 hm
sw04228-B_015875-016470 yeah that's that's pretty good now i don't know how big the car is i mean does it have a big trunk that's sort of the bottom line
sw04228-B_016758-017046 yeah -[th]at's no good [laughter]
sw04228-B_017705-017851 yeah
sw04228-B_017851-018512 someday and and you know if you have kids then you're gonna want to have pa[ssengers]- room for passengers and and uh
sw04228-B_018749-019074 no i just i'm i just um um
sw04228-B_019074-019569 well y[ou]- you can't drive it any faster than the other cars anyway it's not allowed you know b[ut]-
sw04228-B_019569-020117 and and most sports cars don't have room for anything in them_1 that's not my kind of vehicle
sw04228-B_020117-020254 [vocalized-noise]
sw04228-B_020539-021552 well i maybe i don't know about a van the thing i- i hate wh[en]- i hate it when i'm behind vans but being in one would be the opposite effect you could see over everything that would be helpful
sw04228-B_021552-022307 um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping
sw04228-B_022307-023241 so y[ou]- or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the van blocks your field of view but uh
sw04228-B_023241-023764 no i got a regular car but you know f[our]- four door sedan
sw04228-B_024017-024206 yep um-hum
sw04228-B_024381-024887 oh no no not the one for the trunk i didn't get that one that would have been good but uh
sw04228-B_024887-025001 i c[ould]-
sw04228-B_025001-025992 oh yeah you could do that right uh i th[ought]- i thought it was that but it just doesn't work i mean there just is it would it would be it would be it would be nice if i could do that i agree
sw04228-B_025992-026765 is that well well let's let's put it this way the user manual doesn't say anything about it now i don't [laughter-know] it's maybe it's an undocument[ed]-
sw04228-B_026993-028191 this one is so much longer than any other one that i that i that i ever saw that that i didn't even think about writing it no[w]- reading now when i was a little kid and my parents got new cars then i would always read the manual
sw04228-B_028191-028290 [laughter]
sw04228-B_028290-028352 but
sw04228-B_028620-028798 yeah
sw04228-B_028798-029114 yeah once i learned to drive [laughter]
sw04228-B_029114-029308 that story was different
sw04228-B_029308-029407 yeah
sw04229-A_000000-000122 [noise] you have any children
sw04229-A_000223-000440 oh okay any college age
sw04229-A_000784-001128 oh okay so [laughter-you] actually are [laughter-probably] pretty uh
sw04229-A_001289-001850 uh great i'm on the uh the other end of the spectrum actually i'm uh
sw04229-A_001850-002005 uh
sw04229-A_002005-002511 four years into a doctoral program and i am working on my dissertation right now
sw04229-A_002511-002721 [laughter]
sw04229-A_002829-002971 it
sw04229-A_003182-003375 oh
sw04229-A_003375-004007 y[eah]- well it it it's a rough road as i'm sure your son probably can can attest to as well
sw04229-A_004287-004563 yeah yeah that's [noise] that's true
sw04229-A_004860-004984 well
sw04229-A_004984-005347 to be honest with you i'm not i'm not sure that my
sw04229-A_005347-006074 my feelings back then are valid or are to be modeled because i was so young um i guess
sw04229-A_006074-006658 i guess if i had to look at it again i would probably want want to pick a school that
sw04229-A_006658-007442 uh number one had a good financial aid department uh the school i've been at does not i mean yeah it's okay but
sw04229-A_007442-007868 well they they tend to lose things [laughter]
sw04229-A_007940-008503 [laughter] yeah uh they lost my transcripts about four times and [noise]
sw04229-A_008503-009614 yeah that's real frustrating um that's that's one aspect of it i think something that's really important is for the school to have a good library
sw04229-A_009873-010009 [noise] yeah
sw04229-A_010214-010317 um-hum
sw04229-A_010704-010857 great
sw04229-A_010857-011010 sure
sw04229-A_011206-011314 [noise]
sw04229-A_011807-011937 yeah uh-huh
sw04229-A_012403-012493 true
sw04229-A_013332-013442 um-hum
sw04229-A_013794-014120 so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty
sw04229-A_014120-014240 histories were
sw04229-A_014694-014818 right
sw04229-A_015153-015271 um-hum
sw04229-A_015648-015749 right
sw04229-A_016605-016709 um-hum
sw04229-A_017198-017294 sure
sw04229-A_017450-017569 right
sw04229-A_017569-018046 sounds similar to what most schools do in i[n]- on a graduate level
sw04229-A_018046-018643 um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level
sw04229-A_018643-018823 so
sw04229-A_020163-020266 right
sw04229-A_020881-020962 um-hum
sw04229-A_021824-021996 yeah
sw04229-A_021996-022250 [laughter-exactly] [laughter]
sw04229-A_022580-022978 yeah that's that's another thing i wanted to emphasize is that
sw04229-A_022978-023366 if and if and when i ever get to the point to where i'm looking for schools
sw04229-A_023366-023495 uh
sw04229-A_023495-023828 i think i'm gonna opt for a larger one
sw04229-A_023828-024831 just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent i know that i myself went to two schools as an undergrad
sw04229-A_024831-025080 one was small one was not small
sw04229-A_025080-025192 and
sw04229-A_025192-025853 i really think i learned more at the one that was not small because so much of the things i had to do on my own
sw04229-A_025853-026194 and i learned a little bit more about the system in general
sw04229-A_026194-026748 and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into
sw04229-A_027545-027698 right um-hum
sw04229-A_028112-028870 exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do
sw04229-A_028870-029076 any good really i don't think
sw04229-A_029219-029306 yeah
sw04229-A_029652-029733 um-hum
sw04229-B_000000-000067 [noise]
sw04229-B_000067-000276 yes i have three
sw04229-B_000384-000492 uh
sw04229-B_000492-000848 n[o]- well um the youngest just finished med[ical]- school
sw04229-B_000848-000961 [vocalized-noise]
sw04229-B_001070-001368 and so i feel like i'm kind of home free now
sw04229-B_002412-002876 oh well i envy you i wish i had the courage to go back and do that
sw04229-B_002876-003439 but i have afraid i have trouble remembering my own name now much less trying to do a dissertation
sw04229-B_003934-004357 yes but it's it's very worthwhile when you're finished
sw04229-B_004511-005032 well what did you look for when you were getting ready to go to a college to a university
sw04229-B_006913-007050 um-hum
sw04229-B_007394-007537 it's not great
sw04229-B_007768-008071 [noise] oh well that's wonderful news [laughter]
sw04229-B_008302-008420 oh
sw04229-B_008420-008620 that's painful
sw04229-B_008620-008747 yes
sw04229-B_009586-009964 oh i think that is of the utmost importance
sw04229-B_009964-011457 uh my son chose to go to A&M here he uh graduated valedictorian of his high school class so he had you know quite a choice but he wanted a good what he considered one of the best science departments
sw04229-B_011457-012226 and he wanted to practice in Texas so he chose A&M and uh they were kind of pioneers
sw04229-B_012226-013375 in their science department in that you could choose the whichever professor you felt was the would be the most enlightening for wh[at]- particular field you were going into
sw04229-B_013375-013895 and they listed them in a pamphlet that you received so uh
sw04229-B_014014-015214 yes so that you could now you didn't have to report t[o]- i mean you didn't have just one p[rofessor]- professor that you had to be with if you were in engineering department you might want to go to Professor Smith
sw04229-B_015214-015874 and if you were going to be a doctor an MD you might want to go to Professor Jones and then um
sw04229-B_015874-016614 and amongst all those listings they had also classified which what doctors were the better ones
sw04229-B_016614-017632 for each particular segment of that field like one might be better in organic chemistry and one might be better in electrical engineering so uh
sw04229-B_017995-018142 um-hum
sw04229-B_018573-019332 yes and they uh several of the other universities were using them as a model and going to try it because they felt that
sw04229-B_019332-020182 students too often said well the reason i didn't do well on that test is my professor's harder so basically they all gave the same test
sw04229-B_020182-020941 and you could uh you were assigned to a particular place and time to take your test but that was the only time
sw04229-B_020941-021876 now of course that's what i i marvel at some of these youngsters that i see talk about going off to college that have no self-discipline th[at]-
sw04229-B_021876-022109 you know they're never gonna make it
sw04229-B_022109-022751 because_1 no matter where you go you there isn't going to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know
sw04229-B_023775-023914 um-hum
sw04229-B_026703-027606 i would think that would be true you would also you know be totally on your own where you if you need help you're going to be the one to search it out
sw04229-B_027606-028264 it isn't gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything you're going to do
sw04229-B_029040-029375 no i don't think so either now of course uh
sw04229-B_029375-029831 uh i like i came from the midwest so i'm very partial
sw04230-A_000000-000882 well Lynn what do you think should elderly be cared for in the home or do you think they're always better off in a nursing home or are there any answers to something [laughter-like] [laughter-that]
sw04230-A_003788-003892 yeah
sw04230-A_004003-004734 well m[y]- my mother who's seventy is has living with her my eighty nine year old grandmother
sw04230-A_004734-005115 and oh they're doing fine so far [laughter]
sw04230-A_005234-005366 but uh
sw04230-A_005366-005427 i[t]-
sw04230-A_005527-005631 no
sw04230-A_005631-006256 no and and my grandmother's pretty self-sufficient uh she did have a mini stroke recently
sw04230-A_006256-006540 which is left her just a tiny bit addled
sw04230-A_006540-006906 but i don't think she's any place close to needing a nursing home
sw04230-A_008110-008282 oh how sad
sw04230-A_009027-009138 yeah
sw04230-A_010180-010269 um-hum
sw04230-A_010526-010636 yes
sw04230-A_011309-011654 that must have been very difficult for her to make that decision
sw04230-A_013719-014275 i think one of the the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home
sw04230-A_014275-014793 uh i know in Texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes
sw04230-A_014793-015019 that it's just [noise]
sw04230-A_015019-015214 i don't know where you'd start
sw04230-A_017466-017580 yeah
sw04230-A_018771-019495 oh yes and probably underpaid in a lot of cases i mean i think that's treated as pretty much unskilled labor
sw04230-A_021142-021244 yeah
sw04230-A_021519-022104 i wonder if the church run nursing homes in general are better than the others
sw04230-A_023877-023999 yeah
sw04230-A_024203-024570 my late in-laws lived at Leisure World
sw04230-A_024570-026004 uh for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i don't know if you're familiar with that or not it's in Southern California
sw04230-A_029263-029374 um-hum
sw04230-B_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04230-B_000990-001784 well there certainly are times when uh it's necessary i believe to place someone in a nursing home
sw04230-B_001784-002727 um that uh person just becomes too expensive and too um hard on the family
sw04230-B_002727-003013 to care for somebody within their home
sw04230-B_003013-003477 but uh i think everything possible should be done to
sw04230-B_003477-003816 uh keep someone at home before that happens
sw04230-B_004683-004812 oh my
sw04230-B_005082-005291 oh thank goodness
sw04230-B_005291-005534 does your mother have any help
sw04230-B_006894-007337 no i i think it's only when a person becomes
sw04230-B_007337-008161 uh my father had to be placed eventually in a nursing home he had uh Alzheimer's disease
sw04230-B_008280-008482 yeah it's um
sw04230-B_008482-009159 and it was just impossible to care for him uh twenty four hours a day um
sw04230-B_009159-009336 but uh
sw04230-B_009450-009669 and there weren't enough um
sw04230-B_009669-010203 resources i think in the community to help uh my mother care for him
sw04230-B_010203-010572 which was really [laughter-unfortunate]
sw04230-B_010572-011029 i think i[t]- i[t]- it the placement could have been delayed had there been
sw04230-B_011029-011332 um more resources in their community
sw04230-B_011604-011880 oh it it was
sw04230-B_011880-011990 and uh
sw04230-B_011990-012508 i think she she was there every every day uh
sw04230-B_012508-012916 at noon and at night to make sure that he was
sw04230-B_012916-013178 fed and cared for in
sw04230-B_013178-013363 a proper way and
sw04230-B_013506-013650 it was exhausting
sw04230-B_015043-015116 he
sw04230-B_015267-015913 well i think you know the first thing is just to look at [laughter] lots of them and then
sw04230-B_015913-016543 it it does make a difference if there are regular visits by family um
sw04230-B_016663-016891 that uh the staff
sw04230-B_016891-017533 you know is aware that they can't be neglecting somebody if the family's there everyday
sw04230-B_017533-017698 um
sw04230-B_017698-018081 and i i must say i have some sympathy for the
sw04230-B_018081-018400 nursing home [laughter-staff] itself they
sw04230-B_018538-018792 y[ou]- they are overworked
sw04230-B_018792-018872 uh
sw04230-B_019111-019244 certainly
sw04230-B_019552-019847 yes it's doesn't have um
sw04230-B_019847-020463 uh it's not compensated adequately and the um
sw04230-B_020463-020781 and there's certainly no prestige
sw04230-B_020781-020969 attached to
sw04230-B_020969-021562 uh um you know it's sort of a yeah it's it's it's a sad situation
sw04230-B_022242-022990 i think any uh nonprofit facility is probably better run than
sw04230-B_022990-023653 uh those institutions that are strictly for profit uh so that means
sw04230-B_023653-023944 often that they are church run
sw04230-B_023944-024114 but um
sw04230-B_024629-024712 oh
sw04230-B_025961-026082 yeah
sw04230-B_026082-026337 actually i um
sw04230-B_026337-027054 m[y]- my work is to advise families in finding care for their elders
sw04230-B_027054-028251 and sometimes that means getting in all kinds of community resources to the home whether it's Meals-on-Wheels or uh home help aids or whatever
sw04230-B_028251-029075 but when somebody is looking for care i recommend that [laughter-they] [laughter-look] for something that's uh
sw04230-B_029075-029332 has more than one level
sw04230-B_029332-029699 that it's not just an independent living facilit[y]-
sw04231-A_000000-000016 [noise]
sw04231-A_000016-000198 well um do you have any pets
sw04231-A_000544-000677 oh really [laughter]
sw04231-A_000798-000993 [noise] [laughter-oh]
sw04231-A_001353-001550 oh right at this moment
sw04231-A_001550-001734 now what kind of dog do you have
sw04231-A_001867-002000 oh
sw04231-A_002449-002772 i think i can picture that those are the little long haired
sw04231-A_002878-003063 fluffy kind of dogs
sw04231-A_003063-003185 yeah
sw04231-A_003325-003601 they have hair down in their eyes sort of
sw04231-A_003786-003908 yeah
sw04231-A_003908-004233 okay i picture them_1 with bows in their hair [laughter]
sw04231-A_004233-004368 [laughter-for] [laughter-some] reason
sw04231-A_004368-004540 [laughter]
sw04231-A_004540-004988 well i don't blame him [laughter] i have a dog um
sw04231-A_004988-005937 she's a a stray and um or was one and she's i think a mixture between a fox terrier and something else she's about eight pounds she's real little
sw04231-A_006158-006276 yeah
sw04231-A_006276-007277 oh okay yeah well she's really cute and sweet um [noise] but speaking of pets um my brother just got a little Labrador puppy th[at]-
sw04231-A_007277-007516 and i'm living with my brother and
sw04231-A_007516-007802 and uh that's been interesting
sw04231-A_007802-007932 [laughter]
sw04231-A_008145-008261 yeah
sw04231-A_008365-008570 it is uh they've there's
sw04231-A_008570-009266 learning how to play finely and and my dog's establishing her territory because_1 she was there first you know
sw04231-A_009266-009982 but he's so big even as a puppy that um he gets pretty rough when playing and then she lets him know
sw04231-A_009982-010225 that's not good [laughter-no]
sw04231-A_010225-010452 yeah uh
sw04231-A_010730-010866 um-hum
sw04231-A_011091-011258 oh [laughter-huh]
sw04231-A_011258-011407 that's cute
sw04231-A_011942-012100 well that's neat
sw04231-A_012598-012703 uh-huh
sw04231-A_012876-013054 that's good yeah
sw04231-A_013454-013724 m[ore]- more roly-poly [laughter]
sw04231-A_013724-013940 well that's neat that you do that
sw04231-A_013940-014023 huh
sw04231-A_014335-014679 oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally
sw04231-A_014679-014785 yeah

sw04231-B_013806-014475 yeah we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching TV to watch the little dogs play
sw04231-B_014589-014904 oh yeah yeah well i had that
sw04231-B_014904-015374 aquarium first and i got to where i wanted uh
sw04231-B_015374-016226 take my fish out and hold them_1 and pet them_1 [laughter] that wasn't going to work so i had to get something that i could hold and pet
sw04231-B_016226-016504 [laughter-yeah] so

sw04231-B_018499-018698 oh yeah
sw04231-B_018698-018973 does she imitate the mocking birds yet
sw04231-B_019160-019297 oh
sw04231-B_019297-020386 that's the most fun when they hear the mocking birds and then then begin to try to imitate the mocking birds and the mocking bird is imitating something else
sw04231-B_020937-021055 uh-huh
sw04231-B_021457-021605 oh
sw04231-B_021761-021861 yeah
sw04231-B_022462-023231 you know i used to do that for my dog too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet
sw04231-B_023570-023695 um-hum
sw04231-B_024129-025305 well i thought it w[ould]- i thought it would be and i thought i was being a very good dog mother to uh to do that for her but she didn't seem to appreciate it she likes the the quiet
sw04231-B_025305-025911 she also likes being able to hear everything that's going on in the neighborhood and i think the radio masked that
sw04231-B_025911-026049 yeah
sw04231-B_026260-026449 right and look out
sw04231-B_026449-027042 and i had all these delusions about how my dog was not going to go in certain rooms of the house
sw04231-B_027042-028076 [laughter] that's right it's just like you kn[ow]- i surely did [laughter] i surely did well what did you name your dog
sw04231-B_028076-028202 Kitty
sw04231-B_028336-028539 oh how so
sw04231-B_028825-028969 uh-huh
sw04231-B_029703-029786 oh
sw04232-A_000000-000041 [noise]
sw04232-A_000500-000970 no i don't watch that one um i get a lot of my news from uh
sw04232-A_000970-002060 odd sources if it isn't uh public radio or the local listener supported station i get a lot of it off of the uh the nets Usenet BBS networks
sw04232-A_002060-002198 and uh
sw04232-A_002198-002580 monthly and weekly magazines and newsletters
sw04232-A_002809-003128 you ever heard of a magazine called Mondo 2000
sw04232-A_003128-003619 fairly obscure it's published out of Berkeley it's a futurist magazine
sw04232-A_003619-003933 apparently i heard about it later the guy started it
sw04232-A_003933-004580 as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented
sw04232-A_004580-005730 so it's really fringe science um new chemicals brain enhancement technologies virtual reality all that stuff that we're just starting to hear about this whole magazine covers it
sw04232-A_005730-006495 and then from that i can follow up on other sources and a lot of the stuff in there turns up on bulletin boards as people talk about it
sw04232-A_006965-007914 uh depends on what it's about and who's writing a lot of this stuff is just reporting somebody may be developing some new technology and they'll be talking about the plans for the use of it
sw04232-A_007914-008520 it's not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know it's not something that's questionable like political opinions
sw04232-A_008520-009236 it's sort of a state of technology and what are we going to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing
sw04232-A_009536-010118 and then uh you know the the the best source of news the comic strips [laughter] not really
sw04232-A_010503-010752 oh yeah absolutely
sw04232-A_010752-011178 and Bloom County now Out Land and all the rest of them_1
sw04232-A_011178-011425 but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean
sw04232-A_011425-012052 sometimes h[e]- that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not going to see anywhere else
sw04232-A_012052-012728 and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely [laughter-incoherent]
sw04232-A_012728-013847 [laughter] i think that's when it finally they had to issue a press release that Bush was under the effect of this weird drug that uh has been banned in some European countries and that it was affecting his [laughter-speech]
sw04232-A_013960-014109 yeah that's the one
sw04232-A_015020-015176 go back to
sw04232-A_015683-015818 60 Minutes
sw04232-A_015818-016056 60 Minutes i always watch 60 Minutes
sw04232-A_016442-016540 yeah
sw04232-A_016540-017045 i used to watch them_1 but then i caught them_1 in a bald face lie and i ha[d]- didn't really care anymore
sw04232-A_017160-017759 it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft and i used to fly one
sw04232-A_017759-018784 so i knew what i was talking about and they really i mean it was a classic case of what the conservatives accuse the liberal press of doing you know they fabricating uh
sw04232-A_018784-018942 m[aking]- making one
sw04232-A_018942-019361 picking an item out of context and blowing it up i mean it was just such a classic
sw04232-A_019361-019686 yeah they did that i[t]- who damn themselves
sw04232-A_021007-021161 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-really]
sw04232-A_021161-021410 and then there they are doing it too
sw04232-A_021410-022654 so you just have to watch you know you have to assume that with every story you're watching or everything you're reading what what special interest could they possibly have that they would make them slanted this particular way
sw04232-A_022654-023288 if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of [laughter-what's] [laughter-going] [laughter-on]
sw04232-A_024179-024311 um-hum
sw04232-A_024976-025102 um-hum
sw04232-A_026025-026129 oh yeah
sw04232-A_026129-026450 sound bytes all they'd rather do is give you a little sound bytes
sw04232-A_026450-026858 they do i[t's]- it's so funny they talk about the liberal press but
sw04232-A_026858-027967 m[ost]- most every well virtually every TV station and almost every newspaper in the country is owned by conservative well off white businessmen
sw04232-A_027967-028482 and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect
sw04232-A_028482-029589 and they're beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if you're going to be in the business of reporting if you're a journalist uh you get cynical
sw04232-A_029589-029971 and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with [laughter-liberalism]
sw04232-B_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04232-B_000069-000250 well um
sw04232-B_000250-000526 do you ever watch Wall Street Week
sw04232-B_002585-002861 what kind of magazines
sw04232-B_003082-003280 no
sw04232-B_006506-006879 well i mean do you think that magazine is credible
sw04232-B_006879-007024 or
sw04232-B_009173-009378 oh okay
sw04232-B_009990-010720 [laughter] wait so so y[ou're]- you're a a firm follower of Doonesbury or [laughter]
sw04232-B_013784-014044 of uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04232-B_014263-014457 oh
sw04232-B_014457-014683 but um
sw04232-B_014683-015038 anyway well um
sw04232-B_015038-015171 so y[ou]-
sw04232-B_015171-015550 well do you ever watch any network news or
sw04232-B_015550-015808 anything like that a[t]- at
sw04232-B_015985-016518 yeah i watch 60 Minutes and i watch 20/20 sometimes
sw04232-B_016999-017267 what lie did you catch them_1 in
sw04232-B_019181-019465 oh really 20/20 did that
sw04232-B_019465-019647 oh that's so
sw04232-B_019647-019905 that's so funny because um
sw04232-B_019905-021225 Friday night on 20/20 they had Jane Polly talking about how she had been exploited by the tabloids and what a travesty it was that the press would [laughter-fabricate] [laughter-stories] [laughter]
sw04232-B_021225-021437 [laughter]
sw04232-B_021437-021563 so
sw04232-B_022611-022761 um-hum
sw04232-B_023293-024232 i know and it's like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased
sw04232-B_024232-024558 you know just like all the presidential
sw04232-B_024558-024727 um
sw04232-B_024727-025068 campaign things that have been going on
sw04232-B_025068-025932 i[f]- you can just you get a different slant if you just listen to the comments and a lot of times they don't even show you all of what happened
sw04232-B_026037-026178 so
sw04233-A_000000-000908 okay well um let's see
sw04233-A_000908-001910 well um yeah possibly um i'm not familiar with the laws in Texas but we've got a citywide recycling program here in Seattle that's um
sw04233-A_001910-002431 uh w[ell]- well it's it's it's really amazing how ma[ny]- what's that
sw04233-A_002431-003401 um [noise] well they give you really good incentives [laughter] uh they pick up the recycled goods they give you they drop off containers at your house
sw04233-A_003401-003869 so it's like it's like garbage collection um and you don't pay for it
sw04233-A_003869-004097 and uh you s[ame]-
sw04233-A_004097-005038 uh basically at the same time they jack the garbage rates way up [laughter-and] and made it so you had to have city provided garbage cans that were of uniform size
sw04233-A_005038-005646 so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was
sw04233-A_005646-006131 uh you know something that i always put off because_1 you had to haul the stuff and
sw04233-A_006131-006618 and so i you know we didn't do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced
sw04233-A_006618-006776 the uh
sw04233-A_006776-007001 the uh the volume of our trash
sw04233-A_009260-009484 yeah it's like what we have yeah
sw04233-A_009702-009913 oh really [laughter]
sw04233-A_011488-012035 yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper
sw04233-A_012786-013703 oh my yeah they stopped that here they used to have it so that like you could get two can service and you could have huge cans you know that you furnished yourself
sw04233-A_013703-014770 and then you could put a bag out with each can and in fact if you put out more than that they'd pick it up anyway and now they've [laughter-really] tightened up course there's some down sides to this too um
sw04233-A_014770-015382 there's i don't i- i don't know i hear that there's more of a problem with illegal dumping
sw04233-A_015382-015720 after this when it you know after the rates went up
sw04233-A_015720-015827 a[nd]-
sw04233-A_015933-017138 yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the [laughter-stuff] [laughter-they're] [laughter-just] [laughter-they're] [laughter-going] [laughter-to] [laughter-recycle] they now have this huge glut of paper
sw04233-A_017138-018068 um and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of
sw04233-A_018068-018748 recycled paper has gone way down because you know there isn't there isn't enough demand for it all
sw04233-A_019493-019590 [vocalized-noise]
sw04233-A_019590-019715 oh my
sw04233-A_020144-020622 yeah remember when the boy scouts used to do paper drives and make [laughter-money] [laughter]
sw04233-A_021490-021629 yeah
sw04233-A_023654-023761 yeah
sw04233-A_024544-025466 [laughter] yeah i understand until recently you could actually have an open container in your in your pick-up as you [laughter-go] [laughter-down] [laughter-the] [laughter-road] [laughter-there] [laughter]
sw04233-A_025663-025769 [laughter]
sw04233-A_027879-028331 right uh it's it's out of the old west you know like you know
sw04233-A_028331-028544 [laughter]
sw04233-A_029081-029240 [laughter]
sw04233-A_029400-029492 yeah
sw04233-B_000000-000074 [noise]
sw04233-B_000188-000959 i understand you have more aggressive laws both in uh Washington and in Oregon than than we down here in Dallas
sw04233-B_002139-002323 is it mandatory
sw04233-B_002323-002523 is it mandatory
sw04233-B_003623-003756 uh-huh
sw04233-B_004978-005141 uh-huh
sw04233-B_006709-006840 the volume
sw04233-B_006964-007840 well Ted down here we've had the uh containers available in you know various public places now since the mid seventies
sw04233-B_007840-008361 but just in the last few days there's been a proposal now to have uh
sw04233-B_008361-009000 i believe it's about six ti[mes]- four to six times a month they'll have a curb pick-up they'll give you containers
sw04233-B_009000-009390 that are color coded so you can put cans and glass and
sw04233-B_009390-009768 but the difference is we have to pay for that
sw04233-B_009768-010801 about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um
sw04233-B_010946-011501 it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe
sw04233-B_012015-012944 well the garbage rates here are high however as long as you bag it in plastic bags you can put out up to ten or twelve bags of of trash
sw04233-B_013581-013715 uh-huh
sw04233-B_015667-015997 i suspect we're having some of that here too
sw04233-B_018474-018595 yes
sw04233-B_018702-019255 well we've had some what the same problem here i think newsprint's down something like um
sw04233-B_019255-019659 under a dollar now per hundred weight
sw04233-B_019659-020189 and it used to be two and three and i think it even got above three at one point
sw04233-B_020387-020678 yes yes
sw04233-B_020678-021555 there used to be a recycling center where you'd take things in and you know they'd weigh it and pay you and they had paper and of course aluminum cans which are still very viable here
sw04233-B_021555-022009 and they had uh clear glass and colored glass
sw04233-B_022009-022341 but i noticed recently that place has closed up
sw04233-B_022341-022791 now my daughter's really a[ctive]- active in some of this and she there's a place
sw04233-B_022791-023276 oh about eight or nine m[iles]- well i guess it's about six miles from here where you can go and
sw04233-B_023276-023734 uh few things they pay you for most things they just take
sw04233-B_023734-023909 but um
sw04233-B_023909-024326 the movement here has not really progressed there's
sw04233-B_024326-024774 Texas is always slow on a lot of these things
sw04233-B_025306-025712 um yeah that was kind of disastrous
sw04233-B_025712-026181 o[f]- c[ourse]- we've had um major problems with them
sw04233-B_026181-026766 driving while intoxicated and all that i think they're finally starting to get things a little a little more squared away
sw04233-B_026766-027306 but they're a long way from that yet uh Texas has always had a tradition of uh
sw04233-B_027306-028053 people staying away from i mean law[s]- the laws really leaving you alone unless you were clearly doing something
sw04233-B_028159-028278 yes
sw04233-B_028424-028705 just recently there there now uh
sw04233-B_028705-029497 well up until recently you could have a a rifle behind the seat of your pickup and all that kind of stuff and now they're starting to discourage you from that um
sw04233-B_029497-029763 and in there's parts of town here now wh[ere]-
sw04234-A_000000-000149 kinds of music are you into

sw04234-A_023546-023674 yeah i bet
sw04234-A_023674-023969 i- i'd never played really anything throughout school
sw04234-A_023969-024329 i never i don't know i never got in it i thought it would take too much time and all that then i
sw04234-A_024329-024469 i um
sw04234-A_024469-025377 i started getting into uh drums i got this bongo that someone had left at our house and i sort of play on that and i g[ot]- i got a drum set like about three months ago
sw04234-A_025377-025991 and i've we've got extra room in our house and i've been driving all my roommates crazy playing on that but i really need to
sw04234-A_025991-027013 get like i know this guy that i think i'm going to try to get to give me lessons and stuff because_1 there's lots of stuff that i do[n't]- i mean i could i'm improving but slowly and i think i could you know
sw04234-A_027013-027140 learn a lot
sw04234-A_027532-027678 yeah it's true
sw04234-A_027678-028346 which i probably [laughter-already] have because_1 i've been playing for three months but um it's never too late i guess it's not too late to change yet
sw04234-A_028346-028467 but uh
sw04234-A_028467-029116 it's b[een]- that's been a lot of fun and it makes me listen m[ore]- a lot more too to when i'm listening to bands and music and stuff
sw04234-A_029116-029368 uh i mean i i play a lot more attention
sw04234-A_029368-029603 to what they're doing and
sw04234-A_029603-029962 i- i appreciate you know a a lot of what the musicians are do[ing]-
sw04234-B_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04234-B_000133-000522 uh well i i like lots of different kinds of music
sw04234-B_000522-000592 uh
sw04234-B_000592-000851 my uh my uh
sw04234-B_000851-001409 upbringing was in classical music but um i really enjoy um
sw04234-B_001518-001733 all all different kinds of music for example
sw04234-B_001733-002173 i i really get a kick out of Rush and uh and Pink Floyd
sw04234-B_002173-002327 oh yeah
sw04234-B_002678-002964 um no i don't think so
sw04234-B_003581-004099 yeah yeah i'm sure it was um i also like jazz
sw04234-B_004099-004234 a[nd]-
sw04234-B_004234-004759 um we[ll]- ye[ah]- well yeah i like Fusion but i also like uh the classics
sw04234-B_005782-005956 yeah he's great
sw04234-B_005956-006132 he is he's very good
sw04234-B_007526-008260 yeah now i saw him along time ago before he had achieved fame at at the uh Jazz Festival they had in Cleveland
sw04234-B_008371-009285 yeah h[e]- he is really good um i- i- i even enjoy uh some of the old timers like even uh uh from like the big band era like Bennie Goodman or
sw04234-B_009285-010353 uh i saw him play uh when i was a kid also uh of course h[e]- by that time he was he was an old [laughter-man] but it was still fun t[o]- uh fun to listen too him
sw04234-B_012718-012839 right
sw04234-B_013601-013792 yeah no i haven't
sw04234-B_015257-015367 yeah
sw04234-B_015481-016706 yeah i did too i- i- i one of the things gi[ven]- given my classical background uh one of the things that really turns me on is uh when the musicians are are creative with their instrumentation
sw04234-B_016706-017632 um as well as you know the typical creative lyrics or or or melodies i also like that's one of the reasons for example that i like Rush is because it's not always
sw04234-B_017632-018491 you know in two or in four even meter you know i[t]- they they they mix it up they they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with
sw04234-B_018491-018859 yeah and also um Getty Lee on the base
sw04234-B_018859-019858 um it's not -[ju]st a straight base line that just repeats over and over and over again like on the pop tunes it right i[t]- i[t]- i[t]- it it changes up
sw04234-B_019858-020665 um yeah i pl[ay]- i play uh uh oboe and English horn in fact um i've actually started playing again
sw04234-B_020665-021906 uh i played when i was uh up through college in my first year of college and uh then college got the best of me and then i got married and had kids and [laughter-and] i ha[ven't]- really haven't had very much time to play but uh i h[ave]- i found a friend w[ho]-
sw04234-B_021906-022888 i met somebody in town who h[ad]- k[ids]- became friendly with and discovered that we both played oboe in college so we've been trying to uh get together once a month or on[ce]- every couple of weeks and
sw04234-B_022888-023597 and and play a little bit mostly uh it's mostly remedial work for us [laughter-because] we we we're both out of shape
sw04234-B_025256-025341 [noise]
sw04234-B_025341-025460 oh cool
sw04234-B_025821-025929 [noise]
sw04234-B_026966-027358 yeah well also if y[ou]- if you take lessons you might be able to uh
sw04234-B_027358-027660 nip bad habits before they start
sw04235-A_000000-000665 [noise] so i get most of my news i i am sorry to say from CNN Headline News
sw04235-A_000665-001363 so i'm not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like three second sound bytes about everything
sw04235-A_001363-002315 but uh i'm a college student at this point and uh when i come in when i turn that on for half an hour i see what's going on and then i turn it off an[d]-
sw04235-A_002315-002526 so how do you get your news
sw04235-A_002847-002950 hm
sw04235-A_004789-004888 right
sw04235-A_005003-005124 [laughter]
sw04235-A_006137-006458 which newspapers in particular like USA Today
sw04235-A_006637-006723 oh
sw04235-A_006723-006815 um-hum
sw04235-A_007634-007750 right
sw04235-A_008449-008567 um-hum
sw04235-A_009226-010007 well that i think that comes about from the fact that that th[e]- the news gathering business is is just that a business
sw04235-A_010007-011305 so they're going to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant a[t]- now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed
sw04235-A_011626-011761 yeah
sw04235-A_012366-013144 and also i think you'll also notice if you ever do watch CNN Headline News that anytime Ted Turner does anything [laughter] he shows up on there
sw04235-A_013285-014505 yeah y[ou]- you know what though uh i kind of wish that i would uh watch more local news because_1 i end up uh sometimes missing things and hearing them secondhand just because i never do sit down to watch the real news
sw04235-A_015032-015160 yeah
sw04235-A_016144-017137 i think that's the way it usually is th[ey]- they work from the you know the headline stories you know those ones basically people being killed and murdered and and suffering then they go into like
sw04235-A_017137-017754 you know sports and weather then they end up on the really nice stuff so that you're not depressed by the time you're done watching the broadcast
sw04235-A_017941-018060 oh really
sw04235-A_019061-019311 um it's a possiblity
sw04235-A_019867-020034 where in Europe
sw04235-A_020034-020159 um-hum
sw04235-A_020430-020707 i get the [vocalized-noise]
sw04235-A_020862-020955 um-hum
sw04235-A_021296-021411 right
sw04235-A_022617-022724 right
sw04235-A_023590-023698 um-hum
sw04235-A_024475-024667 well i think that's
sw04235-A_024667-025676 uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because_1 obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always going to be someone's the prevailing opinion
sw04235-A_025676-025974 well unless you have a particularly strong
sw04235-A_025974-026453 disparity and there are two you know two competing views exist
sw04235-A_027465-027588 um-hum
sw04235-A_028522-028639 right
sw04235-A_028793-028962 apart from McDonald's
sw04235-A_028962-029115 [laughter]
sw04235-A_029675-029755 right
sw04235-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04235-B_000620-000802 [laughter]
sw04235-B_002435-003485 uh to tell you the truth i get most of my s[tuff]- uh news from printed media um news magazines like Time uh newspapers
sw04235-B_003485-004087 i'll watch television at in the evening for local news but uh
sw04235-B_004087-005580 you know for national things i i tend to go more for printed m[edia]- uh media because they they don't give you the th[ree]- sound bytes the three seconds uh gee he looks good in a in a camera you know uh although i have to admit i'm dissatisfied with the
sw04235-B_005580-006145 quality that you get in the newspapers it's unfortunate but
sw04235-B_006145-006241 that's been
sw04235-B_006241-006920 w[ell]- uh well let's see uh no no actually we're LA Times we also get the New York Times out here um
sw04235-B_006920-008014 and then of course there are lots of specialized publications for you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh
sw04235-B_008014-009281 uh you know you are subjected to censorship uh even though that's a bad word uh what happens is an editor has to decide what will fit in the newspaper and what gets dropped on the floor and that's censorship
sw04235-B_009952-010063 that's right
sw04235-B_011060-011233 i uh
sw04235-B_011233-012452 i i agree with that i've seen that in several uh computer magazines where you know if the guy buys six pages of of color ads then he gets a pretty good review in when they review products
sw04235-B_012857-013473 uh [laughter] gets a favorable light cast on it [laughter]
sw04235-B_014431-015099 well you know there's a big problem with the the local news is something we've noticed i mean out here in LA we get gang shootings you know
sw04235-B_015099-016204 and so what you can do is you turn on the local news and if it's a bad weekend the first fifteen minutes on a on a Sunday night or a Monday night will be how many people got shot and killed
sw04235-B_016889-016991 right
sw04235-B_017264-017368 right
sw04235-B_017598-017996 a lot o[f]- a lot of times though there there isn't the really nice stuff
sw04235-B_017996-019229 oh yeah the uh in i[n]- at least the the news stations that we watch here in LA and i mean you know it's it's uh uh maybe it's just because they're stuck with [laughter] more bad news than good news
sw04235-B_019229-020523 uh but uh you know it's it's it's unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in Europe and we still get uh we lived in Germany and so we still get some German language magazines some
sw04235-B_020642-020899 okay we get [vocalized-noise]
sw04235-B_020899-021341 and uh the thing is that you know that of course is slanted
sw04235-B_021341-022304 from a German point of view and uh you know what you notice are the glaring differences between how America perceives
sw04235-B_022304-022994 some monumentous event in the world versus how the Germans perceive that same event
sw04235-B_022994-024482 and i mean it's uh you know the the difficulty is that okay they're it's a business over there like it is here they're slanting it toward their uh public and we're slanting it toward our public and you know the question is what's the real truth
sw04235-B_025632-025728 yeah
sw04235-B_025952-026193 the winners [laughter]
sw04235-B_026391-026719 well it's also again um you know the
sw04235-B_026719-027795 the uh the the people who write the history it's their view and from wherever they happen to be i mean what we've noticed is that um
sw04235-B_027795-028914 uh the the way the uh the Americans are handling Russia the Germans view that as a critical new market and the Americans are well you know the [vocalized-noise]
sw04235-B_028914-029856 w[ell]- yeah yeah and the uh the thing is that the Americans are well we don't really don't want to get involved with that we don't want to help them they've got to learn to help themselves you know free market econ[omy]-
sw04236-A_000000-000263 [noise] so uh what type of music do you like to listen to
sw04236-A_001288-001511 uh-huh well here's
sw04236-A_001511-002056 well you know i uh i don't listen as much as i used to because uh
sw04236-A_002193-002743 becau[se]- i used to drive to work and that's always good radio time but now i walk
sw04236-A_002743-003112 [laughter] what well i walk and i take the bus
sw04236-A_003112-004029 so i don't get as much radio time and uh we have a small son and it seems like everytime i put on something i want to listen to he starts wanting one of his tapes
sw04236-A_004029-004143 [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04236-A_004143-004863 and uh you know i don't want to discourage him from listening to what he wants to listen to so i put it on and i figure i can listen in a couple years
sw04236-A_004863-005848 uh but i like i like listening to jazz although i'm kind of ignorant about it and uh i like listening to classical although i'm kind of ignorant about it

sw04236-B_025299-025536 huh i don't know i've never heard of them_1
sw04236-B_025666-025791 oh um
sw04236-B_025898-026825 i don't know if you wou[ld]- i don't know if m[ost]- most anybody would call it funk but uh [noise] bands like Primus and Fishbone and things like that
sw04236-B_026997-027653 really i really like um Primus a lot Primus is a good group
sw04236-B_027863-028175 no not really um
sw04236-B_028175-029192 i- i- i think i think that Primus gets a little air time on like MTV and stuff but i don't think i i don't think i've ever heard one of their songs on the radio Fishbone either
sw04236-B_029305-029539 right right yeah
sw04236-B_029785-029853 [noise]
sw04237-A_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04237-A_000047-000562 all right uh what did you look for when you were looking for child care
sw04237-A_005113-005393 i guess that's an important uh
sw04237-A_005393-005730 uh uh i haven't thought about that as much as i
sw04237-A_005730-005830 it uh
sw04237-A_005967-006471 [noise] when we did it [noise] we we didn't really have child care we had uh like
sw04237-A_006471-006646 uh day school
sw04237-A_006646-006927 so they're kids before they went to school and
sw04237-A_006927-007556 well wh[at]- what we had done was talk to the parents a[nd]- of the kids that were there
sw04237-A_007556-008450 and uh all the parents were very enthusiastic so we thought well that's a that's a good point and then we visited once and seemed like they were pretty
sw04237-A_008450-008576 uh
sw04237-A_008689-008897 but i guess there is a difference between
sw04237-A_008897-008992 uh
sw04237-A_008992-009183 day care for kids that are
sw04237-A_009183-009544 couple years away from school and and uh
sw04237-A_009544-009930 child care for now you you and your wife both work right
sw04237-A_010039-010154 so
sw04237-A_013276-013509 oh yeah [laughter]
sw04237-A_014652-014749 uh-huh
sw04237-A_015382-016067 i i guess with the right person if uh as opposed to some of these day care centers where they have
sw04237-A_016067-016917 two hundred kids or something like that or i don't know how many kids they've got but where they have lots and lots of kids it's [noise] it's much tougher to uh
sw04237-A_016917-017130 to rely on
sw04237-A_017130-017690 it's much easier to rely on one person if they're good they're good and if they're bad well you know
sw04237-A_019246-019827 well on the average on the well on on the average they might do uh
sw04237-A_019827-019940 uh
sw04237-A_019940-020071 gosh how should i say this
sw04237-A_020071-020441 you're going for the average the average kid is going to be treated better but
sw04237-A_020441-020824 but you won't have the the uh
sw04237-A_020987-022036 you won't have the risk of getting a real bad one every[body]- everybody knows that they've got a a bad one on the other hand uh that's with uh with a person who's taking care of them_1 in their own home that's
sw04237-A_022036-022940 if they're good like i say you can be pretty sure that they're good and uh so i if they're not so good if they're kind of lazy why the kid's probably
sw04237-A_022940-023394 uh could tell you i i personally would rather have my kids
sw04237-A_023394-023704 uh stay with uh
sw04237-A_023704-024791 you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose if they have two or three good people and they lose one you'll never know it you just pick your kid up from school and
sw04237-A_024791-025303 and uh and see the other question i had is uh
sw04237-A_025303-025959 so do you plan on on uh keeping her in day care until she goes to school
sw04237-A_028036-028453 doe[s]- does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself
sw04237-A_028760-029364 okay i i wondered about that because uh i know some people that do that and
sw04237-A_029469-029952 you know moms can never get sick well a [noise] a day care mother [noise] uh can n[ever]-
sw04237-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04237-B_000547-001132 well we uh we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to uh
sw04237-B_001257-001714 to getting you know because_1 uh usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed
sw04237-B_001714-001981 so that that was a consideration
sw04237-B_001981-002164 um
sw04237-B_002164-002562 uh my wife and her mother went over to the
sw04237-B_002562-002995 uh to the l[ady's]- lady's house who keeps uh Helen
sw04237-B_002995-003601 and uh they you know before uh took her o[ver]- uh actually took her over but before
sw04237-B_003601-003839 we signed up for it and uh
sw04237-B_003839-004167 just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile
sw04237-B_004167-004838 watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we uh
sw04237-B_004838-005151 we went with her and we've been we've been really happy with her
sw04237-B_006577-006715 uh-huh yeah
sw04237-B_009868-010033 um-hum yeah
sw04237-B_010033-010897 yeah the uh [noise] the lady who keeps she keeps uh six children and uh she she really recommends to that uh
sw04237-B_010897-011166 when when like when Helen gets
sw04237-B_011166-011594 a little closer to starting kindergarten that she'd be you know put into a regular
sw04237-B_011594-011952 um day care so that they can they can learn more
sw04237-B_011952-012581 uh uh like the alphabet and the numbers and all that stuff uh although she's she's really good she uh
sw04237-B_012581-012979 uh she makes little uh like handprints
sw04237-B_012979-013759 y[ou]- you know Helen's hand and then puts little designs on them_1 you know and you know so she uh she takes a pretty active role and and uh
sw04237-B_013759-014532 um our little girl she was uh premature and so she had um she was on a monitor
sw04237-B_014532-015379 uh heart monitor and uh that was no problem you know with the uh with the babysitter she you know took it right in stride
sw04237-B_015379-015482 she
sw04237-B_016195-016312 um-hum
sw04237-B_017570-018042 yeah tha[t's]- th[at's]- that's the the finding a good one that's that's the hard part
sw04237-B_018042-018353 um i think you probably have a better
sw04237-B_018353-018780 chance with a day care th[ey're]- they're probably
sw04237-B_018780-019468 it's more of an average so that that there's less chance of having a a bad one yeah
sw04237-B_020380-020520 yeah
sw04237-B_021356-021457 yeah
sw04237-B_022317-022472 yeah
sw04237-B_024474-024637 yeah yeah
sw04237-B_026039-027211 i think uh well i think we're going to keep her where she's at now until she's about uh three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care
sw04237-B_027211-027434 that has uh more children
sw04237-B_027434-027819 and uh and also where they have like the pre kindergarten
sw04237-B_027819-028048 type of uh environment
sw04237-B_028404-028760 uh she she has like uh occasional help that comes in
sw04237-B_029250-029356 uh-huh
sw04238-A_000000-000363 [noise] so uh how do you go about doing household finances [laughter]
sw04238-A_000477-000772 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] me too [laughter]
sw04238-A_003201-003544 boy me too it's uh fly by the seat of my pants
sw04238-A_003544-004233 uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it
sw04238-A_004233-005361 because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and
sw04238-A_005361-005878 and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly
sw04238-A_005878-006321 but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage
sw04238-A_006321-006669 then she dropped out of the work force and uh
sw04238-A_006669-007116 we we have two children both under four so uh
sw04238-A_007116-007633 i i've taken total responsibility but i guess i haven't taken [vocalized-noise]
sw04238-A_007633-007780 yeah yeah
sw04238-A_007780-008341 th[ey'll]- [laughter-be] yeah they'll be uh four and two in April respectively
sw04238-A_008722-009028 we're probably the same age [laughter]
sw04238-A_009028-009700 forty two yeah most most of my friends have uh children uh y[ou]- who are having children it seems like
sw04238-A_009700-009926 but uh we [vocalized-noise]
sw04238-A_010565-010672 um-hum
sw04238-A_010785-010880 yeah
sw04238-A_012231-013250 yeah i think wh[en]- uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility
sw04238-A_013250-013803 uh [noise] it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff
sw04238-A_013803-014765 now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesn't i'm not being critical but my wife kind of has
sw04238-A_014765-015076 the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check
sw04238-A_015076-015795 you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
sw04238-A_015795-016346 yeah right yeah [laughter-that's] [laughter-yeah] that's kind of how it comes out
sw04238-A_016346-016468 uh
sw04238-A_017222-017326 um
sw04238-A_019391-019512 um-hum
sw04238-A_020260-020996 yeah well ho[w]- how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh
sw04238-A_020996-022071 in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really going to watch it and we'll t[ry]- try to control the big thing[s]-
sw04238-A_022886-022985 um-hum
sw04238-A_023608-023820 well that's how we both are
sw04238-A_024570-024765 yeah we we
sw04238-A_025508-026076 yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility
sw04238-A_026076-027092 and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that
sw04238-A_027092-028298 [noise] and my wife was working at the time so i[t]- it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasn't too difficult with the two incomes
sw04238-A_028298-029083 and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have children so we sort of indulged and we
sw04238-A_029083-029634 uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it
sw04238-A_029634-029885 well that's what exactly what happened yeah w[e]-
sw04238-B_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04238-B_000368-000928 pretty loosely [laughter] i don't have a i've never have a
sw04238-B_000928-001689 had a tremendously organized budget i've you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by
sw04238-B_001689-002340 you know looking at the previous month and i know about_1 what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and
sw04238-B_002340-003410 and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within i've i've just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes
sw04238-B_006478-006657 [noise]
sw04238-B_007071-007217 oh wow
sw04238-B_007453-007690 you've got two now under four
sw04238-B_007690-008015 wow [laughter]
sw04238-B_008306-008762 i've got a senior in high school who's just just getting out in May
sw04238-B_008903-009109 yeah i'm forty four
sw04238-B_009109-009263 and
sw04238-B_009840-010641 we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a l[ong]- for a long time
sw04238-B_010641-012048 but that's real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesn't or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about [laughter-it] [laughter-or] [laughter-something] you know so we finally switched to
sw04238-B_012048-012384 the two method too it seemed to work better
sw04238-B_013795-013939 oh sure
sw04238-B_015665-016328 you still got checks you still got money right [laughter]
sw04238-B_016328-017389 well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and uh not really
sw04238-B_017389-017847 mix the two and uh the you know bills that are
sw04238-B_017847-018796 if we're both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion
sw04238-B_018796-019429 and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever
sw04238-B_019429-020294 if it's something we're doing that way if it's uh if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do
sw04238-B_021091-021182 well
sw04238-B_021812-022736 uh it's kind of the way it is it's it's never been uh like my brother is organized to the {n-th} degree he and i are exactly opposite he's two years younger than i am and
sw04238-B_022736-023709 he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and he's a real tight wad with uh the money and i've always been a little looser
sw04238-B_023709-024550 and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh
sw04238-B_024550-025382 during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then that's kind of a joint
sw04238-B_025382-025611 thing too so
sw04238-B_026742-026951 oh yeah those are
sw04238-B_029319-029500 that'll do it everytime
sw04238-B_029500-029885 you immediately get pregnant if you do that [laughter]
sw04239-A_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04239-A_000015-001159 well the main uh two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work um somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and it's probably several tons of them_1
sw04239-A_001159-001940 and uh white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got um
sw04239-A_001940-003165 newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now i've got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs
sw04239-A_003165-003905 and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now
sw04239-A_003905-004101 which is a little disturbing
sw04239-A_004295-005458 i don't know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be um chipped down and used for a lot of things like uh carpet industry's pretty big in the northern part of the state here
sw04239-A_005458-006609 and i've heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i don't know if there's any use for those strange opaque milk carton type um plastic jugs or not
sw04239-A_006994-007466 yeah they seem to be a pretty nasty k[ind]- thing whatever that is
sw04239-A_009073-009266 oh very good
sw04239-A_009462-009649 [noise]
sw04239-A_009649-009860 yeah yeah
sw04239-A_011630-011790 yeah
sw04239-A_012699-012818 hm
sw04239-A_014082-014341 yeah that's kind of reasonable
sw04239-A_015797-016127 um yeah
sw04239-A_016318-016459 yep
sw04239-A_017601-017765 i understand
sw04239-A_017765-017950 never heard of that one before
sw04239-A_020046-020253 [laughter]
sw04239-A_020924-021147 [laughter]
sw04239-A_021478-021883 that's an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before
sw04239-A_021883-022284 [noise] that seems like a prime candidate for recycling though
sw04239-A_023300-023483 [noise]
sw04239-A_023483-023656 yeah
sw04239-A_023949-024389 and those packing peanuts are hard to avoid in a business too
sw04239-A_025957-026140 uh yeah
sw04239-A_026140-026349 yeah they'll last forever
sw04239-A_026349-026877 all these millions of years nothing has um [noise] evolved to take care of that stuff
sw04239-A_028312-028478 hm
sw04239-A_028973-029338 do they use a lot of recycled goods for their raw material
sw04239-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04239-B_001100-001194 uh-huh
sw04239-B_002557-002662 uh-huh
sw04239-B_003128-003235 uh-huh
sw04239-B_003870-003953 huh
sw04239-B_004061-004329 uh is that because they can't do anything with them_1 or uh
sw04239-B_005411-005510 um-hum
sw04239-B_006473-006588 uh-huh
sw04239-B_006588-006953 yeah i don't even know what they're made out of [vocalized-noise] urethane or
sw04239-B_007059-007164 -[some]thing like that
sw04239-B_007409-008043 yeah yeah we've actually got uh see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got
sw04239-B_008043-008354 several different recycling things going on and um
sw04239-B_008354-008543 uh at home
sw04239-B_008543-009527 we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oi[l]- you know engine oil
sw04239-B_009527-009790 which is a hard one to get get rid of
sw04239-B_009790-011278 to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have um there's a recycling center down at uh park not far from us
sw04239-B_011278-012737 uh where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so there's all uh you know all the different ca[tegories]- categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think it's like plastics glass paper
sw04239-B_012737-013225 [noise] and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh
sw04239-B_013225-014133 for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because_1 they felt like it was just going to cost them_1 money or [laughter-something]
sw04239-B_014133-014249 [laughter]
sw04239-B_014249-014528 and uh so they put up uh
sw04239-B_014528-015538 eventually you know there's enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different uh bins one of them_1 was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office
sw04239-B_015538-016098 but there're so many restrictions on what you can toss in there that it's almost more of pain than it's worth [vocalized-noise]
sw04239-B_016098-016865 no you know no clips no staples you know and so it's kind of it's kind of a pain you have to get get in that habit
sw04239-B_016865-017746 and uh the other ones [laughter-uh] they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on
sw04239-B_017746-019091 and they were act[ually]- yeah they were actually um in the uh staff meetings that we used to have there was [laughter-this] [laughter-guy] who's job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money
sw04239-B_019091-020147 of this company made on recycling and so he'd say you know and i'd like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents
sw04239-B_020147-021604 on styrofoam cup recycling so we were we were always making jokes about you know maybe we could fold that over into computer purchases or something like that you know so by the year you know twenty fifty you know we could buy a Cray or something you know wi[th]- but uh [laughter]
sw04239-B_021747-022011 [noise] yep [noise] so
sw04239-B_022225-023439 yeah for uh w[ell]- they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we won't we won't let anybody use anything styrofoam [laughter] so they stopped buying coffee cups [laughter-and] stuff like th[at]-
sw04239-B_023439-024020 which is a real pain you know because_1 i mean not everybody uh wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us haven't been you know
sw04239-B_024208-024329 yeah
sw04239-B_024329-024443 yeah
sw04239-B_024443-025592 so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually i'm i'm a big uh i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh
sw04239-B_025592-026213 plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like tha[t]- it's pretty pretty gory [laughter]
sw04239-B_026316-026394 yeah
sw04239-B_026762-026817 uh
sw04239-B_026817-027064 there there's actually a company out um
sw04239-B_027064-027640 uh straight west of us in Strasburg Virginia that makes arm rests for cars
sw04239-B_027640-028387 in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car Japanese or American these guys make
sw04239-B_028387-029009 and uh so it's a giant plastics pla[nt]- i think they have a se[venty]- like a seventy five percent market share or something
sw04239-B_029156-029621 uh i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is
sw04239-B_029621-029799 is that they have because of cer[tain]-
sw04240-A_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04240-A_000024-000365 so how do you like the benefits of TI
sw04240-A_000972-001161 oh that's right yeah
sw04240-A_002809-003298 yeah tha[t's]- that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is
sw04240-A_003298-004033 it's you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a
sw04240-A_004033-004546 either 40[1K]- well i guess you get part of into 401K one oh 401K
sw04240-A_004546-005108 but what what is the uh key heal[th]- plan that people who are privately employed use
sw04240-A_006653-006805 right
sw04240-A_007088-007198 um-hum
sw04240-A_010559-010657 yeah
sw04240-A_010657-011141 what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on
sw04240-A_011141-011453 your last salary when you left the company
sw04240-A_011453-011798 so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years
sw04240-A_011798-012497 you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone
sw04240-A_012497-013499 um you know your twenty years is worthless just because it's it's not an index to fund it's based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there
sw04240-A_013926-014042 yeah
sw04240-A_014611-014845 i[t]- be[nefits]- benefits in general
sw04240-A_016592-016716 um-hum
sw04240-A_016716-017059 well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're
sw04240-A_017059-017421 you know it's well it's actually can go both ways someth[ing]- some ways you have
sw04240-A_017421-017829 more opportunities because_1 there're so many things going on within the company
sw04240-A_017829-018646 but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project
sw04240-A_018646-019596 and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in t[o]- to any area they want to
sw04240-A_020223-020537 yeah the[re]- there was some clicking on the line i'm not sure what
sw04240-A_020537-021049 whether that's local or somewhere in the long distance network between
sw04240-A_021049-021280 New Jersey and wherever you are
sw04240-A_021280-021448 California okay
sw04240-A_021772-022037 this is also possible
sw04240-A_022037-022268 somewhere between Texas
sw04240-A_022645-022797 um-hum
sw04240-A_023805-024218 well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesn't
sw04240-A_024218-024593 it gets cheaper again but then again there's y[ou]- y[ou]-
sw04240-A_024951-025057 um-hum
sw04240-A_025667-025959 yeah i know New Jersey is
sw04240-A_025959-026598 just slightly above the national average which was yeah it's about twice the price of Atlanta
sw04240-A_026740-027098 but uh the hou[sing]- the housing prices have definitely dropped
sw04240-A_027800-028651 yeah co[st]- cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do
sw04240-A_029524-029683 yes [noise]
sw04240-B_000000-000041 [noise]
sw04240-B_000435-001146 um well actually to tell you the truth uh not very well i resigned from Texas Instruments not shortly
sw04240-B_001146-001679 ago and found that my uh after having worked there for
sw04240-B_001679-001899 twenty one years
sw04240-B_001899-002052 [noise]
sw04240-B_002052-002372 my vested interest in my
sw04240-B_002372-002879 pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary
sw04240-B_004844-005216 [noise]
sw04240-B_005216-006695 um i don't know uh th[e]- the uh i g[uess]- i guess the th[at]- that issue was a TI retirement uh benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits
sw04240-B_006695-006875 um
sw04240-B_006875-007115 if you don't retire you get shit
sw04240-B_007115-008055 uh but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you can't do that you can't just kiss them_1 off if they don't retire
sw04240-B_008055-008350 and so there's some nominal uh
sw04240-B_008478-008899 a[mount]- amount that has to be vested with the employee
sw04240-B_008899-009591 but uh in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean
sw04240-B_009591-010205 uh it's time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by
sw04240-B_010205-010557 invoking this uh defined benefits plan
sw04240-B_011458-011543 right
sw04240-B_012765-012858 right
sw04240-B_013448-014011 which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account
sw04240-B_014011-014742 um of course the initial question that was asked related to uh actually i can't remember anymore but to
sw04240-B_014742-016090 [noise] it related to what do you look for in a position other than salary and i guess my mind before it referred to benefits my mind was not thinking a long the with the i[deas]- lines of benefits at all but rather
sw04240-B_016090-016211 um
sw04240-B_016211-016658 career g[ratification]- gratification and you know that kind of thing
sw04240-B_018576-018708 um-hum
sw04240-B_018965-019022 um-hum
sw04240-B_019548-019620 um-hum
sw04240-B_019774-020301 boy i th[ere]- there were some something happened to your s[ignal]- your signal at that point did you notice it
sw04240-B_020430-020482 yeah
sw04240-B_021213-021334 in California
sw04240-B_021481-021793 or whether it's part of the uh switchboard system
sw04240-B_021924-021985 yeah
sw04240-B_022126-022704 well [noise] party of m[y]- part of my reason for coming to California was California
sw04240-B_022704-023442 uh it is it i love it it's a wonderful place but the the price of housing is
sw04240-B_023442-023690 is just totally
sw04240-B_023690-023835 looney
sw04240-B_024398-025245 well that's true up in Redding uh th[e]- housing prices are probably comparable to Dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are
sw04240-B_025245-025713 about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous
sw04240-B_026707-026900 at any rate
sw04240-B_027049-027603 [noise] so i guess one of the things you look for in a job uh is um
sw04240-B_027603-027849 affordable cost of living
sw04240-B_028744-029566 of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work
sw04240-B_029566-029952 not so great for the family but uh
sw04241-A_000000-000235 [noise] okay um
sw04241-A_000235-000885 i guess i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the army for twenty years so uh
sw04241-A_000885-001025 uh
sw04241-A_001025-002011 [laughter-right] so uh actually the f[irst]- my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small community near here and they
sw04241-A_002011-002311 they gave each household one of these plastic
sw04241-A_002311-002683 uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in
sw04241-A_002683-003128 and uh then when we moved into the townhouse where we are now
sw04241-A_003128-003553 th[ere]- there again there was no recycling program and now there is
sw04241-A_003553-003747 and uh so we
sw04241-A_003747-004443 we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which
sw04241-A_004443-004539 [noise]
sw04241-A_004883-004997 um-hum
sw04241-A_005968-006078 um-hum
sw04241-A_006763-006896 um-hum
sw04241-A_007068-007179 um-hum
sw04241-A_007463-007576 hm
sw04241-A_007957-008067 um-hum
sw04241-A_008433-008498 uh
sw04241-A_008648-008765 right
sw04241-A_008765-009554 ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and that's on Thursday
sw04241-A_009554-009704 so uh
sw04241-A_010070-010506 um-hum yeah it's just a small town and it's uh it's locally sponsored
sw04241-A_010506-010776 i don't know what they do with it uh that always
sw04241-A_010776-010871 uh
sw04241-A_010871-011372 uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh
sw04241-A_011899-012001 um-hum
sw04241-A_012400-012557 um-hum
sw04241-A_012557-013173 hm now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that
sw04241-A_013173-013507 i think part of the recycling responsibility falls
sw04241-A_013507-014074 uh not only with the local or county governments but with the individuals as well
sw04241-A_014074-014975 becau[se]- uh the individual family is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled
sw04241-A_014975-016117 and so i've kind of looked for because i'm interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling i've looked for those things that i can recycle
sw04241-A_016117-017091 that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example [noise] what i do is uh
sw04241-A_017091-017985 recycle the grass clippings and all the leaves that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my neighbors rake up for me [laughter] it's uh
sw04241-A_017985-019005 it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection [laughter] and uh
sw04241-A_019005-019328 so then i just uh get as much as i need
sw04241-A_019328-020492 which sometimes embarrasses my wife [laughter] she says please don't pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it
sw04241-A_020492-021039 see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i
sw04241-A_021366-021487 um-hum
sw04241-A_021956-022051 hm
sw04241-A_022217-022331 uh-huh
sw04241-A_022628-022846 [laughter-really]
sw04241-A_022846-023340 so you you have dogs that are vegetarians huh gee that's odd
sw04241-A_023514-023652 hm
sw04241-A_023892-024096 oh [laughter]
sw04241-A_024238-024345 um-hum
sw04241-A_024682-024794 um-hum
sw04241-A_024949-025107 they they do to huh
sw04241-A_025107-025382 well that's odd i'd never heard of dogs eating
sw04241-A_025382-026279 uh vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and
sw04241-A_026279-026856 fruits and vegetable leftovers or [scrapses/scraps] that uh it does not attract animals
sw04241-A_026856-027314 um because there's no meat in it or a[nything]- or fish or anything like that
sw04241-A_027314-028129 that's interesting that [laughter-you] [laughter-have] dogs that are attracted to compost well they guess they'll be healthy dogs [laughter]
sw04241-A_028129-029030 [laughter-right] so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings
sw04241-A_029030-029259 i look at what
sw04241-A_029259-029673 i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have
sw04241-A_029673-029840 that i can use in the g[ardening]-
sw04241-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04241-B_000799-001255 oh you're an environmental engineer's dream [laughter]
sw04241-B_002652-002778 uh-huh
sw04241-B_003530-003614 uh
sw04241-B_004342-005184 that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is going to be one of the keys to uh recycling success
sw04241-B_005184-006043 um i know here we have in my community now we're i'm in unincorporated i'm in the county by i'm unincorporated
sw04241-B_006043-006465 uh within a certain city limits there's there's more uh
sw04241-B_006465-007526 uh more i- i- i just want to say better programs here we have uh trash pickup twice a week and on the first day they'll pickup aluminum cans and on the second they'll pick up newspapers
sw04241-B_007526-007957 and um i think those are you know the kind of the core
sw04241-B_007957-008780 crops if you will just to because they're the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle
sw04241-B_009536-010151 oh are is is your community recycling sponsored by your local government
sw04241-B_011265-012592 yeah there're a lot of different ways to recycle you can um especially with the plastics you can melt them down and reform them or you can actually recycle them_1 and it depends on whether they segregate the different types of plastics there're seven main types
sw04241-B_013988-014125 right
sw04241-B_014870-015028 that's right
sw04241-B_015401-015517 oh
sw04241-B_016428-016659 oh you do organic gardening
sw04241-B_017754-018084 oh how wonderful you're doing so well [laughter]
sw04241-B_018409-018501 uh-huh
sw04241-B_018704-018899 [laughter-right] [laughter]
sw04241-B_019507-019945 [laughter]
sw04241-B_020438-020550 uh-huh
sw04241-B_020795-021130 yeah that's wonderful i'd l[ove]- i'm i have
sw04241-B_021130-022280 tried not too diligently to get involved with that organic gardening {composting} i have two dogs and they would eat every bit of compost i'd put out there and i fenced it off with chicken wire about two or three feet high
sw04241-B_022280-023003 and they'd jump over the wire just to eat the little egg shells and potato peels and just whatever they could put their little jaws on it was awful
sw04241-B_023110-024111 [laughter-yeah] pe[ople]- people say it's just part of my Karma i'm not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact i've got some corn beef on the stove right now but i uh
sw04241-B_024111-024757 don't eat much meat or as much as i used to but my dogs since i've been eating more produce
sw04241-B_024757-025041 eat more produce anyway [laughter]
sw04241-B_025041-025178 yeah
sw04241-B_025603-025776 yeah they'll
sw04241-B_025776-025841 yeah
sw04241-B_026813-026909 huh
sw04241-B_027300-027540 well yeah
sw04241-B_027695-027878 yeah
sw04241-B_027878-028412 yeah [laughter] well with my luck they'll live forever huh [laughter]
sw04241-B_029616-029728 um-hum
sw04242-A_000000-000574 [noise] okay Michelle well since i started off i uh since i called in i guess i'll state my opinion first
sw04242-A_000574-001629 and uh i i guess i'd fall in the same category that i don't think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is self-propelled or has to be towed Americans should be able to own it
sw04242-A_001629-001766 [noise]
sw04242-A_003814-003925 uh-huh
sw04242-A_004032-004139 um-hum
sw04242-A_004736-004867 absolutely
sw04242-A_004968-005776 i agree i think parents should be held responsible if their child gets a hold of one or either injures injures another person or or themselves
sw04242-A_005956-007427 i also am in favor of a check i- i think the criminal record system in the country should be brought up to snuff so that they can run a computer check as easy as they do when you run a credit card through so they can see if a person insane or is a felon
sw04242-A_007427-007545 i don't [noise]
sw04242-A_007908-009102 it wouldn't do any good right now because the criminal record systems are a mess you know i mean there really isn't any any system as such but if there were and if the government were to invest in that then there wouldn't be any problem they'd
sw04242-A_009102-009422 they'd be able to identify those that shouldn't have
sw04242-A_009422-009963 well there isn't any computerized system that can tell you you know
sw04242-A_009963-011341 yeah i mean in Virginia has done it by the way reason i i'm a life member of the Gun Owners and i am sure no long[er]- member of the NRA so i i'm kind of into this but Virginia Virginia does have an instance check uh system
sw04242-A_011341-011808 they do have their records within a state computerized and it seems to be working well
sw04242-A_011808-012104 and if it could be done on a federal ba[sis]-
sw04242-A_012104-012347 the only state that i'm aware of
sw04242-A_012347-012481 that's done that
sw04242-A_012917-013120 well uh
sw04242-A_013120-014017 yeah it really you know it's it should be done on a national basis because on the statewide basis you just get those that have violated state laws but
sw04242-A_014017-014460 yeah and some there are federal you know violators too
sw04242-A_014460-015301 so it would require an investment on the part of the government to to bring their records up to shape but i think it's uh probably a good investment anyway uh
sw04242-A_015401-015506 yes um-hum
sw04242-A_016036-016151 uh-huh
sw04242-A_016307-016384 uh-huh
sw04242-A_016891-017013 oh yes
sw04242-A_017406-017514 um-hum
sw04242-A_017743-018342 you know uh in that case uh in particular that fellow that did that had owned those guns a long time
sw04242-A_018342-018901 so i mean it's not like he went in and picked them up and uh then went off on a shooting spree
sw04242-A_018901-019045 and
sw04242-A_019683-019793 that's right
sw04242-A_019793-020700 unfortunately whenever something like ha[ppens]- that happens uh people tend to blame the gun and not the person it is it's it is the person
sw04242-A_021918-022018 um-hum
sw04242-A_022646-023280 yeah i feel that you should be you know you uh if you were single should be allowed to have a weapon to [vocalized-noise] yourself
sw04242-A_023280-023414 but if it
sw04242-A_023414-023807 um-hum but if there were a total ban you know who'd have the guns
sw04242-A_023807-024203 it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the people who'd go to buy them_1 honestly
sw04242-A_024203-024340 [laughter]
sw04242-A_024714-024822 right
sw04242-A_024935-025706 that's right and gun control laws don't stem them because uh they don't they don't most of the criminals don't go buy their guns uh from a gun store anyway
sw04242-A_025706-025957 they get them_1 through the through the black market
sw04242-A_026392-026898 well it's uh it's certainly a a lengthy subject and there's a lot of
sw04242-A_026898-027633 there's a lot of uh discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but
sw04242-A_027633-028951 but i i've i just feel that the founders of our country the co[nstitution]- people that wrote the constitution didn't intend for us to not have a means to protect ourselves either either from without the country or from within the country
sw04242-A_029119-029808 no i don't i used to i i used to now i'm just a target shooter yeah i used to go uh
sw04242-B_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04242-B_000468-000599 okay
sw04242-B_001696-001814 okay
sw04242-B_001925-003097 um i really don't know exactly where i stand just to be honest i have mixed feelings about it and i've thought about both positions i would like to have the freedom
sw04242-B_003097-004083 to own a firearm um i am currently married and that makes me feel more secure but if i were single i would definitely want to have a firearm
sw04242-B_004083-004747 uh of course i think it should be locked up you know so that children can not
sw04242-B_004747-004859 get
sw04242-B_004859-005023 their hands on it
sw04242-B_005651-006049 um-hum definitely definitely
sw04242-B_007173-007329 yeah
sw04242-B_007329-007980 right now i've heard a lot of people say that that wouldn't do any good but i really think that it makes a lot of sense
sw04242-B_008282-008397 uh-huh
sw04242-B_009201-009483 what do you mean the criminal records are a mess
sw04242-B_009869-010058 by the push of a button
sw04242-B_010842-011014 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04242-B_011587-011705 [noise]
sw04242-B_011851-011953 hm
sw04242-B_011953-012127 are they the only state
sw04242-B_012297-012465 gosh
sw04242-B_012465-012987 so what has to take place them to to make this happen to other states
sw04242-B_012987-013181 that makes a lot of sense
sw04242-B_013929-014167 y[ou're]- right right
sw04242-B_014372-014545 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04242-B_015194-015481 um-hum so you're from New Hampshire
sw04242-B_015481-016461 i'm not even i hate to admit uh that familiar with what the laws are here in Texas regarding purchasing a firearm um
sw04242-B_016461-016699 i guess you heard about the
sw04242-B_016699-017474 the massacre in [vocalized-noise] that's only about an hour in fact that's where all my cousins live i used to go down there every summer
sw04242-B_017474-017734 so that was a real shocker
sw04242-B_018217-018404 yeah that's true
sw04242-B_018660-018789 um-hum
sw04242-B_018789-019522 um-hum um-hum yeah so it um it couldn't have been avoided by you know any type of law being
sw04242-B_019522-019783 uh set
sw04242-B_019783-019913 but
sw04242-B_020451-020658 yeah this is true
sw04242-B_020658-020781 [noise]
sw04242-B_020781-021339 yeah oh i tend to agree with you in in that i believe that
sw04242-B_021440-021542 th[at]- th[at]-
sw04242-B_021542-022393 like you're saying the majority i believe would be responsible with with the weapon and Lord knows with the crime rate the way it is
sw04242-B_022393-022787 we need to have something to protect ourselves
sw04242-B_022895-022988 [noise]
sw04242-B_023141-023286 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04242-B_023286-023464 yeah i know how to use it
sw04242-B_023741-024011 oh yeah oh sure
sw04242-B_024151-024277 uh-huh
sw04242-B_024277-024559 yeah it would be the people that you know could
sw04242-B_024559-024975 get in touch with the underground or something and i mean they have ways
sw04242-B_025636-025768 yeah
sw04242-B_025906-026367 yeah yeah you're right that's what i was thinking
sw04242-B_026367-026496 w[ell]-
sw04242-B_026717-026964 it is it's very complex
sw04242-B_027494-027756 um-hum um-hum um-hum
sw04242-B_028554-028653 yeah
sw04242-B_028905-029225 yeah do you do a lot of hunting
sw04242-B_029225-029376 with your guns
sw04242-B_029554-029707 are you
sw04242-B_029707-029808 so do yo[u]-
sw04243-A_000000-001130 [noise] okay_1 um we're talking about uh trial by jury and whether or not we thought it was a a fair way to do it do you think that they ought to have the uh the judge do the sentencing to try to make it more uniform or more fair or or what do you think
sw04243-A_003107-003976 well there there is an argument in that uh a judge has seen a lot more cases and you know perhaps he sees one crime
sw04243-A_003976-004752 and and he can compare that crime to you know his long history of of of dealing with with criminals and uh
sw04243-A_004856-006062 the the jury you know this is you kn[ow]- maybe they've sat on sat on a jury once before maybe this is their very first time the only they've really seen is like Gaudy on TV or something like that you know and and they just you know they just kind of
sw04243-A_006062-006390 you know making guesses how bad they think it is
sw04243-A_009328-009691 yeah yeah as as uniformed a[s]- i mean he would he would
sw04243-A_009691-010367 figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is like one
sw04243-A_010367-010849 um one murderer or or let's say one one thief
sw04243-A_010849-011110 um getting like
sw04243-A_011110-012089 a tenth of the penalty of of another thief simply because perhaps he impressed the jury more or or you know just be[cause]- because his presentation was better
sw04243-A_013310-013411 yeah
sw04243-A_014219-014339 exactly
sw04243-A_015230-016542 see i would almost argue i would consider i i i don't under[stand]- i don't know i haven't thought it out long enough to figure out all the ramifications but getting rid of the entire trial by jury and and having the judge decide guilty or not guilty
sw04243-A_018124-018436 [laughter]
sw04243-A_019503-019935 [laughter-oh] [laughter] oh man
sw04243-A_020115-020240 uh
sw04243-A_023161-023923 yeah but i think the the we the people that that our founding fathers were talking about were rich white males
sw04243-A_023923-024118 i mean i don't think
sw04243-A_024118-025205 i- i don't think they had a real high opinion of of the masses i mean Hamilton was was a prime case you know he he didn't i think he referred to them_1 as the mindless masse[s]- he didn't want them_1 to vote he didn't want them_1 to have any say in government
sw04243-A_025523-025664 right
sw04243-A_026287-026504 you know that never occurred to me
sw04243-A_027587-027691 [noise]
sw04243-A_027928-029223 well i mean only one sen[se]- it seems like a needless step but i think there's only been one person who haven't voted as he was voted into or there's only i think only been one electoral vote that was n[ot]- not voted at in the electoral college
sw04243-A_029223-029538 as the [propular/popular] a[s]- the popular vote was voted
sw04243-A_029538-029652 so
sw04243-B_000000-000090 [noise] uh
sw04243-B_001055-001258 well um
sw04243-B_001258-002024 i think that uh when you're tried by a jury of your peers they probably uh the collective
sw04243-B_002024-003121 mind of the jury is probably a better vehicle for sentencing than the judge himself uh because_1 then there's the consensus thing rather than a uh a single person
sw04243-B_003548-003676 um-hum
sw04243-B_004562-004686 um-hum
sw04243-B_005687-005825 um-hum
sw04243-B_006328-006792 yeah well i would i c[ould]- i would argue back that uh
sw04243-B_006792-008109 a a single person being able to pass a sentence on someone um leaves it open to his or her own uh biases and they may consider
sw04243-B_008109-009426 arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn't be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge him[self]- him or herself
sw04243-B_009582-009714 [noise]
sw04243-B_011712-011850 uh-huh
sw04243-B_012032-012809 yeah that's a that's one of the biggest uh biggest problems i think in our society is that uh the the justice system
sw04243-B_012809-014175 uh basically goes by who's got enough money for the best lawyer and uh the presentation is is everything um so you know you you could have a real dirt ball
sw04243-B_014175-015363 be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and and uh color the color the jury's opinions but um i don't know
sw04243-B_016509-017018 well we could do that or we could explode it to it's logical extreme or it's or
sw04243-B_017018-017258 ridiculous extreme and
sw04243-B_017258-017649 take uh the new interactive television uh
sw04243-B_017649-018301 technology that's coming forward and uh have everybody in the country or everyone who chose to tune in
sw04243-B_018301-019773 decide guilt or innocence and then uh have a sliding scale of you know the fifty nine percent of the people said you were guilty that means you get the life in prison you know um [laughter]
sw04243-B_019773-020776 [laughter] Wheel of Justice we [laughter-could] have a game show you know we no there there i[t]- it does need reform uh i would worry about a single judge uh
sw04243-B_020776-021369 passing sentence uh especially i[n]- in a more involved trial uh
sw04243-B_021369-022848 i i don't know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and th[e]- r[eason]- the reason that we went away from the single judge or the the the triad i guess of judges that they have uh in some systems it just um
sw04243-B_022848-023314 you know they become instruments of the government and
sw04243-B_023865-024042 um-hum [noise]
sw04243-B_024445-024550 [noise]
sw04243-B_025148-026484 oh yeah that's why they uh made election days on Tuesday in November you know Tuesday was a work day and November was a real pain to travel in November back in what seventeen eighty three um
sw04243-B_026484-027983 so i you know they sort of arranged it so that a[nd]- you know and the electoral college is all rigged anyway i mean in theory they have to vote for [laughter] whoever the delegates choose but [noise] it's you know i[t]- they don't have to um
sw04243-B_029156-029263 um-hum
sw04243-B_029491-029818 um-hum well we're straying from our topic of j[ury]-
sw04244-A_000000-000041 [noise]
sw04244-A_000041-000323 okay i think we're all set there hopefully
sw04244-A_007951-008203 well unfortunately that's the typical picture though
sw04244-A_010008-010353 is your mother-in-law currently uh living in a nursing home or anything
sw04244-A_015055-015311 have you guys thought about the financial burden
sw04244-A_015311-015511 of caring for
sw04244-A_015511-015954 your mother-in-law as far as putting her in a nursing home down the road
sw04244-A_021251-022090 well my mother my grandmother is in a place similar to that where she has emergency buttons throughout the throughout the house or actually the apartment
sw04244-A_022090-022892 a[nd]- she's about eighty one and she lives she has her own little area for gardening and so forth it's in the [vocalized-noise] housing authority up here
sw04244-A_022892-023029 and it's
sw04244-A_023029-024039 when she first moved up here she ended up living in [vocalized-noise] uh tall apartment building a complex that was very similar to a hospital
sw04244-A_024039-024320 a very negative feeling when you walked in the building
sw04244-A_024320-024549 and now she's been very fortunate
sw04244-A_024549-024887 in that she's al[most]- almost like living in a small home
sw04244-A_024887-025429 and sh[e]- she still has an a large maintenance staff take care of the place look after her
sw04244-A_025429-025566 provide uh
sw04244-A_025566-025799 basic busing services and travel
sw04244-A_025899-026000 uh
sw04244-B_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04244-B_000345-001359 well uh care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me uh right now my father-in-law has uh
sw04244-B_001359-001679 been diagnosed with terminal cancer
sw04244-B_001679-002390 and my mother-in-law is in a wheel chair so this is something that i've been thinking quite a bit about lately
sw04244-B_002390-002574 and uh
sw04244-B_002574-003384 i'm i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for
sw04244-B_003384-003567 uh someone else
sw04244-B_003567-004836 that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's th[ere's]- a very hard question o[f]- of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves
sw04244-B_004836-005000 um
sw04244-B_005000-005965 in the case of my mother-in-law she's not able to to bathe herself but she's sharp as a tack at this point and
sw04244-B_005965-006890 what sort of facilities are available for that person it's hard because you think of a home and you're really thinking of
sw04244-B_006890-007581 of uh old people left somewhere to uh you know fairly forgotten and that's
sw04244-B_007581-008009 tha[t's]- that's a hard thing and i'm sure not all of them are like that
sw04244-B_008141-008258 yeah
sw04244-B_008258-009329 so i[t's]- it's very hard to find a facility that would allow uh allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life
sw04244-B_009329-009884 but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services
sw04244-B_010276-010514 no she's not um
sw04244-B_010514-011631 she's still at home and her son has has moved back into the house uh wh[ich]- which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because uh
sw04244-B_011631-012431 um my father-in-law and my brother-in-law have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway
sw04244-B_012431-012756 uh so i[t]- it's a little less
sw04244-B_012756-013117 uh i[t's]- it's not all that inconvenient for him
sw04244-B_013117-013211 but
sw04244-B_013211-013740 the rest of the kids are scattered uh throughout the northeast
sw04244-B_013740-014144 and he doesn't want to feel that he's
sw04244-B_014144-015000 uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws
sw04244-B_015821-016677 that that ha[s]- we've all thought about that fortunately uh that doesn't seem to be a big problem but
sw04244-B_016677-017309 th[at]- we there's some thought that has to be given to to uh
sw04244-B_017309-017924 to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in Connecticut
sw04244-B_017924-019268 and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do
sw04244-B_019268-020712 is uh find the sort of place where i t[ry]- described before where [noise] she'd be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various
sw04244-B_020712-021154 various things and have someone there in case she falls or something
sw04244-B_021700-021826 um-hum
sw04244-B_022569-022668 um-hum
sw04244-B_022896-023000 that's great
sw04244-B_023563-023662 um-hum
sw04244-B_024181-024325 right
sw04244-B_024827-025000 that's that's great
sw04244-B_025755-025848 um-hum
sw04244-B_025951-026449 i'm hoping that the trend is toward places like that
sw04244-B_026449-026640 as
sw04244-B_026640-027049 the population in America uh
sw04244-B_027049-027524 lives for a longer period of time uh
sw04244-B_027524-028286 i- i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself
sw04244-B_028286-029095 you really weren't going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required
sw04244-B_029095-029838 was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh
sw04244-B_029838-030000 can have injury
sw04245-A_000000-000523 [noise] uh consumer products and y[ou]- have you ever rec[ently]- uh re[turned]- returned anything recently
sw04245-A_001311-001623 repair parts for cars or something
sw04245-A_004103-004202 huh
sw04245-A_004202-004316 nope
sw04245-A_004316-004498 no lemons huh
sw04245-A_008320-008461 [laughter]
sw04245-A_008602-008750 well that's good
sw04245-A_009398-009645 that's a long way to go [laughter]
sw04245-A_010832-010996 oh that's good
sw04245-A_011678-012138 well it's been difficult i don't know i haven't really returned anything because there's a lot of
sw04245-A_012138-012519 inertia to get through that process [laughter]
sw04245-A_012519-013170 um uh actually n[o]- i have tried to get it fixed for example i've had a
sw04245-A_013170-013489 i guess a uh a VCR
sw04245-A_013489-013667 and uh
sw04245-A_013667-013936 it was uh brand new
sw04245-A_013936-014735 and uh pretty pretty top of the line type of VCR and i had problems with it uh recording uh things
sw04245-A_014735-015665 uh some[thing]- it would it was strange uh you can fast forward play through it and you'd see this uh picture on there
sw04245-A_015665-016359 but if you played it normal it would go in and out uh between uh blue program screen and the actual
sw04245-A_016359-016680 thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre
sw04245-A_016680-016959 and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals
sw04245-A_016959-017438 i'm saying well you know i'm paying this a lot of money for this uh
sw04245-A_017438-017817 VCR and you're telling me just because it hasn't doesn't have a
sw04245-A_017817-018072 you know a strong enough signal it'll do this
sw04245-A_018072-019308 and that's strange because_1 if it's if it's not strong enough then why is it that when you uh go slow motion or freeze frame or fast forward through it you can see the picture but
sw04245-A_019308-019908 when it uh you play it normal it goes in and out that's very bizarre to me
sw04245-A_019908-021233 and uh i have the worst time trying to -[ju]st get him look at this problem and it ends up that they you know they just uh concluded that's that's all that's wrong with it and that's no[thing]- no[thing]- nothing wrong with the product and i said
sw04245-A_021233-021444 just great [laughter]
sw04245-A_023408-023636 [laughter] um-hum
sw04245-A_024358-025196 well i don't know it's uh it's hard to say it's th[ere's]- there's nothing i could it didn't seem like there was much i could do about it
sw04245-A_025196-025936 a[nd]- i don't know if it's really getting better or worse um in that case [laughter] it didn't really get any better
sw04245-A_025936-026047 uh
sw04245-A_027036-027235 no i don't know
sw04245-A_027929-028036 [laughter]
sw04245-A_028036-029123 y[eah]- well a lot of them probably say they don't know anything about it [laughter] i don't know it just a lot of them give you the line uh you know we have re[pair]- car repair's the same problem
sw04245-A_029123-029863 things like that uh with all the electronics in the cars s[ay]- but say say it gets a lot better gas mileage and
sw04245-B_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04245-B_000510-001045 well most recently the kinds of things i've been returned actually are uh are
sw04245-B_001045-001335 parts of you know repair parts
sw04245-B_001441-002416 uh oh for for cars or for plumbing parts that kind of thing actually surplus parts tha[t]- you know you need you think you need it and uh
sw04245-B_002416-003913 want to make sure you've got everything you need and taking things back and so uh other than that uh you know i haven't had an opportunity where i've needed to return something due to uh poor service or you know failure of it
sw04245-B_003913-004155 uh [noise]
sw04245-B_004155-004299 i guess
sw04245-B_004502-005351 n[o]- no i guess well the closest thing we did have is couple weeks ago uh starter on our [daur/daughter's] daughter's car failed
sw04245-B_005351-006723 and so i had to uh try and find a replacement on a Sunday which in south [vocalized-noise] is not very easy we don't have a whole lot of Sunday shopping for those kinds of things and uh
sw04245-B_006723-007208 and actually then it ended up with needing to found the parts but then
sw04245-B_007208-007625 there were some re[cent]- very recent repairs on the starter done
sw04245-B_007625-008020 and uh so my daughter took it back to the
sw04245-B_008020-008598 repair shop that did the work for her hundred and forty miles from here and they gave her money back right away
sw04245-B_008719-009074 presented you know tried to present a sound case for
sw04245-B_009074-009252 defective equipment and
sw04245-B_009252-009409 everything went very well
sw04245-B_009409-009538 usually doesn't
sw04245-B_009538-010143 yeah well she's going to school there right now so [noise] you know she was headed back there so
sw04245-B_010143-010616 certainly wouldn't make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but
sw04245-B_010616-010863 uh she was headed back there so
sw04245-B_010863-011636 worked out well how about_1 yourself you had any recent uh experiences where with products that you've had to return
sw04245-B_012454-012551 um-hum
sw04245-B_013421-013551 um-hum
sw04245-B_015865-015999 um-hum
sw04245-B_018038-018155 [laughter]
sw04245-B_021175-022121 at the yeah [noise] well that's i guess that's one of the frustrations you end up talking with people that uh you know
sw04245-B_022121-023421 think they have considerable knowledge and uh you're not really convinced that they do and you almost end up bringing a third party in that uh you have trust in their competence
sw04245-B_023421-023604 uh
sw04245-B_023604-024358 now it's not my position to advise and i don't have that [vocalized-noise] experience with it certainly sounds like a bill of goods trying to be sold to you
sw04245-B_024517-024581 uh
sw04245-B_025133-025250 yeah
sw04245-B_025881-026947 you know or you know um i guess in situations like that are there other manufacturers or other companies that uh you can consult
sw04245-B_027058-027572 [noise] you know like a similar pro[duct]- somebody that sells a similar product and say
sw04245-B_027572-027917 this you know am i getting the right kind of story here
sw04245-B_028048-028147 uh
sw04245-B_028405-028495 yeah
sw04245-B_029097-029188 yeah
sw04246-A_000000-000036 [noise] okay_1
sw04246-A_000036-000210 so what do you think about space flying
sw04246-A_000550-000659 oh yeah
sw04246-A_001755-001845 um-hum
sw04246-A_002196-002522 yeah i i i have read a couple articles on it yeah
sw04246-A_002858-002994 oh okay
sw04246-A_003539-003616 right
sw04246-A_003992-004051 hm
sw04246-A_004361-004641 so basically would they uh
sw04246-A_004641-005524 would they essentially in terms of mag[netism]- magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so you'd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw
sw04246-A_005948-006103 oh interesting
sw04246-A_006891-006996 um-hum
sw04246-A_007145-007227 right
sw04246-A_008610-008755 static charger
sw04246-A_008900-008982 right
sw04246-A_009176-009351 oh that's pretty interesting
sw04246-A_009351-010501 yeah yeah personally i think that uh we don't spend enough on space exploration and i think we probably should spend more just because it you know it it not only benefits uh
sw04246-A_010501-011217 space per se but it also benefits technology you know you start to develop things specifically for space use
sw04246-A_011217-011781 and you know the offspring technologies can benefit a whole lot of different aspects of society
sw04246-A_011781-011903 so that's
sw04246-A_012403-012481 yeah
sw04246-A_013763-013972 sure
sw04246-A_013972-014066 yeah it's it
sw04246-A_014767-014885 [laughter]
sw04246-A_014885-015333 yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but
sw04246-A_015333-015552 you know also you got to consider that
sw04246-A_015552-015676 it's
sw04246-A_015676-016175 this space exploration could give us a lot of different view points o[n]- on current problems
sw04246-A_016175-016474 um primary of which in my mind right now is
sw04246-A_016474-016734 uh the whole thing with uh
sw04246-A_016734-016966 the depleting o[zone]- ozone layer
sw04246-A_016966-018051 you know i was reading an article about that the other day and it's a[mazing]- really amazing how much we're losing uh how much of the ozone layer's really disappearing there's an article in Time magazine about it but
sw04246-A_018051-019016 you know things like that can be very well uh studied from space you know and using satellites and space technology and things like that
sw04246-A_019016-020041 uh i think that's real important and if we if we don't look at that closely we could be really screwing ourselves uh
sw04246-A_020041-020801 i don't know it's it's it's an it's an interesting thing because_1 it's like you said some of the positions seem untenable at least when you're trying to defend them_1
sw04246-A_020801-021593 in in congress and things like that people tend not to have a very long term view like to look at more uh
sw04246-A_021593-022130 more short term problems which you know they're logical and they're
sw04246-A_022130-022649 and they're very prevalent you know things like world hunger yeah that's a big uh that's a big problem
sw04246-A_022649-022759 um
sw04246-A_022759-022986 but you've got to have a long term view as well
sw04246-A_023469-023693 yeah yes exactly
sw04246-A_023693-024352 most people will will try to to solve the symptoms without really looking at the uh the problem itself
sw04246-A_025038-025151 um-hum
sw04246-A_025900-026074 right you start
sw04246-A_027207-027315 sure
sw04246-A_027455-027609 wh[ere]- where do you work
sw04246-A_027609-027737 uh-huh
sw04246-A_028164-028304 oh okay
sw04246-A_028850-029939 oh okay great yeah i was just i was asking because it's interesting to see where we're both coming from i personally am kind of biased [laughter] because_1 right now i'm working for Honeywell
sw04246-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04246-B_000170-001522 uh well uh i was just reading something on it as a matter of fact uh just got uh latest copy of uh Analog magazine and it had an article in it on uh uh a new
sw04246-B_001522-002242 a new version of propulsion that they're looking at um are you familiar with uh the solar sail idea
sw04246-B_002514-002948 uh well this is apparently what they call a magnetic sail
sw04246-B_002948-004404 um basically they just uh set up a large uh magnetic field and uh it's works a lot like sailing on the ocean uh and is a lot more flexible than using solar sails
sw04246-B_005514-006041 um that's the thing about it is you can switch it depending on the circumstance
sw04246-B_006041-007516 um and it also works uh you can use it to uh pull yourself out of like a low earth orbit uh by using the earth's magnetic field and moving from there and it also acts like um
sw04246-B_007649-007838 like a uh uh
sw04246-B_007838-008622 uh i don't know it's called it's a it's a shield against uh radiation and and flare and that sort of thing because_1 it builds up um
sw04246-B_008622-009393 it builds out a a magnetic barrier around it uh kind of like the earth's magnetoshpere and uh protects the people that way yeah
sw04246-B_010085-010229 yeah
sw04246-B_011862-012765 it's that and you also have the benefit of the things that you just don't know about yet i mean the biggest the biggest uh thing that comes from
sw04246-B_012765-014142 space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea we're going to discover it's it's all the surprises the problem with that is you can't
sw04246-B_014142-014970 preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're going to discover

sw04246-B_024313-025553 yeah with space exploration it's a lot like um like trying to jump into a new industry you've got huge start up costs uh lot bigger in this case than in most others but once you're established there
sw04246-B_025553-026277 i think it would you know i think it's obvious to everyone that it would be highly profitable uh once you've reached a certain level it just takes
sw04246-B_026277-027543 that rather substantial long term commitment you know for a for a number of years or or even several decades in order to to get it up to the standard where you need it uh in order to go from there um

sw04248-B_022874-024057 you see the same thing you never go far enough to see anything really different and i like the change of scenery and stuff so that's why i was thinking of my wife and i about getting a bike for each of us and then you know we you can go
sw04248-B_024057-025389 uh we live right close by them_1 we i live right at the base of the Wasatch mountains here and so i close enough that we there's trails and everything all of the way around and that we can go up and use and we go camping quite a bit and we take them_1 with us you know we take them_1 with us there so
sw04248-B_025389-025834 there's a lot of area we can go in up around there i have just one little daughter
sw04248-B_025834-026363 you know and actually that's my exercise now just trying to keep up with an eighteen month old that's more than enough so

sw04249-A_017070-017474 and like i said i live in an apartment complex
sw04249-A_017474-017798 and so they don't do it for us
sw04249-A_017798-018298 but some of the houses i've seen some of the bins around some of the houses
sw04249-A_018633-018902 there is a place
sw04249-A_018902-019172 but it's in Wilmington
sw04249-A_019172-020424 and so it's like a a big hassle you know to try to get everything together and i mean uh you'd have to save it up and have all that stuff lying around your apartment
sw04249-A_020650-021000 it's um about twenty minutes
sw04249-A_021229-021372 um-hum
sw04249-A_021551-022225 i know but i just think it's it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this
sw04249-A_022430-022600 really
sw04249-A_023199-023374 um-hum
sw04249-A_025944-027001 yeah now see th[at]- i think that's why it's not as strict in the south it's because we still ha[ve]- have a lot of land left
sw04249-A_027001-027848 so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always going to be land
sw04249-A_028222-028377 um-hum
sw04249-A_028847-029575 but i know i went to see my brother in Philadelphia in May and he
sw04249-A_029575-029872 was in a voluntary program
sw04249-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04249-B_000224-000370 yeah
sw04249-B_000650-000800 well yeah
sw04249-B_000800-000898 [vocalized-noise]
sw04249-B_001023-001628 we have a lot of recycling in Rochester they do uh what they call curb side pick up
sw04249-B_001628-002626 and so they come by and they'll pick up uh the newspapers and cardboard and uh different colors of glass and uh
sw04249-B_002626-003749 see what else tin cans and uh plastic like you know your milk jugs and you know s[oap]- s[oap]- soap bottle uh jugs and all that type of stuff
sw04249-B_003924-004400 yeah so do they do any uh any sort of recycling back down where you are
sw04249-B_005070-005277 um-hum
sw04249-B_005277-005449 okay
sw04249-B_006300-006476 um-hum
sw04249-B_006922-007225 okay do uh
sw04249-B_007225-007749 i mean what do you think they ought to be doing down there in terms of doing more recycling and things like that
sw04249-B_008645-008797 um-hum
sw04249-B_009150-009448 oh wow that's really unfortunate
sw04249-B_009448-010266 well they do a whole lot of recycling here in Rochester i'm kind of hard pressed to say they ought to do more because i don't know what else they'd pick up i mean you know they
sw04249-B_010266-011095 they say things like you know they want all the little uh you know those little recycling symbols like the number ones and the number twos and all those things
sw04249-B_011095-011950 well they you know they say they'll pick up anything with number two but they guys who are uh picking it up are are kind of [vocalized-noise] i don't know i guess they aren't well trained
sw04249-B_011950-012899 because_1 like they s[ay]- they also say they won't pick up you know the you know like you buy a uh uh uh a six pack of pop and you know the plastic rings that they come in
sw04249-B_012899-014146 well nowadays those are coming with a little recycling symbol on them_1 you know with the number two but they won't pick it up because_1 they say well no we don't pick up that we only pick up you know like the milk jugs and soap jugs and stuff like that
sw04249-B_014146-014546 so i think they could be doing more if they here in Rochester
sw04249-B_014546-014751 if they just uh
sw04249-B_014751-015750 quit doing uh you know so much based on what the container is in terms on what used to have in it or something and if they did more on
sw04249-B_015750-016000 you know what the material is
sw04249-B_016099-016599 so uh i don't know so they don't do any recycling hardly at all down there
sw04249-B_016948-017098 yeah
sw04249-B_017378-017525 um-hum
sw04249-B_017678-017876 okay
sw04249-B_018199-018674 okay well do you have any place you could take stuff if you wanted to
sw04249-B_019126-019275 okay
sw04249-B_019449-019599 yeah
sw04249-B_019778-019948 yeah
sw04249-B_020298-020678 we[ll]- that's wild i mean like well how far is Wilmington from there
sw04249-B_020899-021600 oh wow so you'd have to get everything together and take it over there that'd be a real pain they ought to do the curb side stuff
sw04249-B_022023-023259 they do it here i mean they they have it here in Rochester in the apartments and people you know they have to do some special stuff but you know the apartment comple[x]- it's not the city see here in Rochester the city does it
sw04249-B_023259-023854 it would like i- i own my own house so the city comes by and they pick up you know
sw04249-B_023854-024149 the stuff on the same day they pick up the trash
sw04249-B_024149-024747 but for the apartments all the apartment places you know pay somebody to pick up all the trash
sw04249-B_024747-026074 and so the apartment pe[ople]- you know the the the waste disposal people have to come up with their own system but we passed a law here and they said you just got to do it there's no choice because all the you know all the landfills up here are full
sw04249-B_026448-026599 yeah
sw04249-B_026873-027080 oh wow
sw04249-B_027080-027327 but that's going to change
sw04249-B_027499-027628 yeah
sw04249-B_027750-028900 yeah that's going to change at some point you know [vocalized-noise] a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know [laughter-we're] [laughter-we're] in trouble and we got to fix this problem
sw04249-B_029199-029350 yeah
sw04249-B_029779-029872 um-hum
sw04250-A_000002-001001 i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because_1 i i'm at i'm a student at Rice University and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is about three miles
sw04250-A_001001-002202 and um that's sort of i guess it's probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times a week with um a friend
sw04250-A_002397-003550 uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at night i fee[l]- i mean sorry not at night i feel perfectly safe at night i usually do it with someone else uh
sw04250-A_003899-004800 well let's see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh it's not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean it's not really great
sw04250-A_004800-005471 um south is the area that's really crime ridden that's sort of the south main area um
sw04250-A_005471-006669 yeah so that that's not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the campus itself uh the uh Rice has their own police department and they're pretty aggressive about
sw04250-A_006823-007348 no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall hedge so
sw04250-A_007348-007924 but uh yeah it does [vocalized-noise] yeah at least it's a psychological barrier so
sw04250-A_009243-010046 yeah it's really it's a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering it's in the [laughter-middle] of [laughter-the] ugly city like [laughter-Houston] but uh
sw04250-A_011400-011599 hm
sw04250-A_011599-011708 yeah
sw04250-A_012225-012528 yeah i can um
sw04250-A_012528-013850 one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because_1 if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky
sw04250-A_014175-014300 yeah
sw04250-A_014399-014675 yeah that too i mean uh the um
sw04250-A_014675-015919 but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten [laughter-miles] [laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-to] you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard
sw04250-A_015919-016768 and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll [laughter-probably] i'll be more of a workout but
sw04250-A_016923-017127 that's pretty good yeah
sw04250-A_017498-017630 yeah
sw04250-A_019131-019600 wow that that that's a fair amount that's more than i do by a considerable amount
sw04250-A_020048-020180 yeah
sw04250-A_020500-021579 yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason a[nother]- another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a [laughter-long] [laughter-time]
sw04250-A_021579-022899 because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can [vocalized-noise] i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really
sw04250-A_022899-023150 it's kind of like an investment that pays off
sw04250-A_023377-024864 well i mean it's kind of it's it's you know it's good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other player run to where he's [laughter-not] i mean you hit the ball it's kind of like tennis in that sense but you're not ch[asing]- always chasing after the ball um
sw04250-A_024864-026150 but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know people to play with because it's more it's more interesting i mean there's you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise
sw04250-A_026275-026399 [noise]
sw04250-A_026399-026576 yeah oh yeah
sw04250-A_026699-027949 yeah yeah and it took a li[ttle]- it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i don't know two or three weeks of playing uh you know t[o]- i didn't really get that great of work out but but i[t]- now i it's pretty good
sw04250-A_028896-030016 yeah i can i can understand knee problems because_1 i've found i haven't had trouble with it this year but in past years when i've you know done only running and not racquetball um my
sw04250-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04250-B_000249-000401 good
sw04250-B_001347-001479 um-hum
sw04250-B_002098-002499 Bill do you feel safe running across the campus
sw04250-B_003123-003266 um-hum
sw04250-B_003379-003947 well the area immediately north of you and immediately west of you is not a very good area
sw04250-B_004275-004426 yes
sw04250-B_005199-005598 okay the south main yes okay i know what you're talking about
sw04250-B_006131-006249 um-hum
sw04250-B_006578-006997 well you've got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter
sw04250-B_007199-007399 okay well
sw04250-B_007399-007675 i know you have some separation because
sw04250-B_007781-008271 my uh son went to Saint Thomas for uh a year and
sw04250-B_008271-008917 and uh we drove over and looked at Rice with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but
sw04250-B_008917-009299 anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus
sw04250-B_009826-010473 yeah uh my exercise program i u[sed]- i did run
sw04250-B_010473-010970 uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking
sw04250-B_010970-011299 uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a
sw04250-B_011299-011846 in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful
sw04250-B_011846-012372 and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run
sw04250-B_013346-013498 um-hum
sw04250-B_013700-014498 well the emotional the emotional benefits of running are almost as good as the physical benefits i use it as stress relief
sw04250-B_015246-015422 [laughter]
sw04250-B_015578-015680 yeah
sw04250-B_015826-016049 um-hum that's true
sw04250-B_016227-016350 yeah
sw04250-B_016529-016998 well i walk forty five i walk forty five to fifty minutes
sw04250-B_016998-017721 which is uh between two and three miles at a at a fairly comfortable [vocalized-noise] uh
sw04250-B_017721-018299 the last time i was doing an aggressive running program i was in graduate school about um
sw04250-B_018398-018948 oh it's i guess it's been ten years ago now but uh anyway i was doing i was running three miles
sw04250-B_018948-019300 a day five times a week and that
sw04250-B_019448-020119 well that w[as]- that was because i was in graduate school and i was doing about a sixty hour week
sw04250-B_020119-020598 and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control
sw04250-B_021497-021649 yes
sw04250-B_023050-023450 i've never tried the handball do you find that helps you a lot
sw04250-B_023849-024000 um-hum
sw04250-B_024249-024399 yes i
sw04250-B_024526-024649 yes
sw04250-B_025400-025551 um-hum
sw04250-B_025848-026029 right
sw04250-B_026029-026847 and as long as you keep moving you have the aerobic effect and i i'm sure if you have a [vocalized-noise] half way good player you do keep running
sw04250-B_027895-028999 um-hum i used to uh years ago play tennis but again uh as you get older tennis is pretty rough on the knees i'm sure handball would be also
sw04250-B_029797-030016 um-hum
sw04251-A_000000-000176 [noise] hi this is David from Florida

sw04251-A_010048-010398 [laughter] oh you wh[y]- why do you think uh we're not getting our money's worth
sw04251-A_011298-011697 [laughter] you probably see the waste first hand then
sw04251-A_012454-012597 um-hum
sw04251-A_013349-013498 yeah
sw04251-A_013600-014223 right well the the thing that makes me angry about paying taxes i don't mind paying it for services you know for defense
sw04251-A_014223-015525 uh the country and uh and and for services like roads and for sewage and and for basic water and stuff but when we got to pay for uh some of these people that are on welfare and stuff that's when i get uh i get pretty mad
sw04251-A_015525-015848 uh i mean i think a lot of that is wasted
sw04251-A_016699-016925 [vocalized-noise]
sw04251-A_016925-017248 yeah right i i[t]-
sw04251-A_017399-017551 yeah
sw04251-A_017774-017922 yes
sw04251-A_018030-018998 yeah tha[t's]- that's tha[t's]- that's true uh i'm not sure what to do about it though uh you know this is a big election this year and everything we all these guys running for president and uh
sw04251-A_018998-019152 i
sw04251-A_020147-020299 um-hum
sw04251-A_020975-021148 yeah
sw04251-A_021848-022027 what's [laughter-that]
sw04251-A_023398-023648 no no i don't i don't think we are

sw04251-A_024150-024473 um i- i don't agree with [laughter-that]
sw04251-A_024798-025599 oh you mean by us paying taxes is a poor step we are doing that indirect oh yes i agree i think that's the way the well yes i- i do agree with [laughter-that]
sw04251-A_025599-025799 [laughter]
sw04251-A_025799-026923 yeah i- i thought you [vocalized-noise] but i personally was doing that [laughter] no i [vocalized-noise] i don't think we're standing in the way but i think that the way the welfare system is set up yes it does kind of foster that kind of an attitude with people
sw04251-A_026923-027648 when they can just sit around their porches all day and uh still get a check at the end of the week i think that's uh pretty pitiful especially when they're able bodied people
sw04251-A_028022-028198 [laughter]
sw04251-A_029021-029800 yeah well the you know the the thing is we get these people in there that are like career politicians and they're grieved by so many people
sw04251-A_029800-029891 and they're
sw04251-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04251-B_000049-000449 hi Lee from [vocalized-noise] New York
sw04251-B_000449-000602 yes
sw04251-B_000848-001424 yeah it snowed this morning and it was all gone by noon
sw04251-B_001574-002067 well i don't know yeah i guess it's not really cold
sw04251-B_002349-002581 [noise] oh shucks
sw04251-B_002972-003147 oh yeah
sw04251-B_003702-003953 like the usenet news groups
sw04251-B_004398-004948 oh yeah i saw it on uh something called Comp DCom Telecom
sw04251-B_005199-005669 um i'm a county engineer i look mostly at sewage
sw04251-B_006375-006600 uh oh yeah

sw04251-B_008251-008575 all right taxes well
sw04251-B_008575-009700 i think uh people are not getting the money's worth and number two i think people aren't willing to pay good money for a decent value
sw04251-B_009700-009974 so i got to blame everyone on that
sw04251-B_010400-011197 well i think there's uh some entrenched greed in general mismanagement in government
sw04251-B_011197-011574 hey i work for the government [laughter] i
sw04251-B_011677-012798 well we've you know we've got a lot of people who are dedicated and trying to do a good job but we've also got a lot of people that think the world owes them a living and you know they don't want to do anymore than they've
sw04251-B_012901-013757 you know than they did last week or they don't want to do any more than the least they can possibly do they have no pride no pride at all
sw04251-B_015799-016594 yeah well there's a lot of money in that and where there's a lot of money there tends to be a lot of uh
sw04251-B_016594-017100 what is it uh greed deceit mismanagement
sw04251-B_017100-017550 who was it who wrote Animal Farm George Orwell
sw04251-B_017550-017897 absolute power corrupts absolutely
sw04251-B_018549-018679 [vocalized-noise]
sw04251-B_018999-019670 uh it seems to me that there's this uh basic idea that you shouldn't let people starve to death
sw04251-B_019670-019949 and that you should have some sort of
sw04251-B_019949-020228 Christian charity toward them
sw04251-B_020228-020322 [noise]
sw04251-B_020322-021047 and that uh people just aren't willing to let people starve to death in the streets if they don't want to work
sw04251-B_021174-021650 and uh therefore they're not willing to change the systems
sw04251-B_021650-022570 i got another theory if you want to hear it it's not really mine just that the uh the powers that be mainly you and me
sw04251-B_022570-023247 are keeping this whole class of people poor and helpless just so they're out of the way
sw04251-B_023720-024249 well we're definitely keeping them poor and down trodden and helpless
sw04251-B_024352-024973 you don't think the welfare system fosters a whole class of people that
sw04251-B_025101-025250 yeah
sw04251-B_025250-025423 i- i mean i[t]- it it

sw04251-B_028327-029168 and uh i'm not agitating against it i'm not agitating for it that's for damn sure can i say that on this
sw04252-A_000000-000022 [noise]
sw04252-A_000022-000150 what do you feel about it

sw04252-A_002698-003049 oh really that's kind of creepy
sw04252-A_003574-003732 yeah
sw04252-A_003899-004400 well what do you think about like automatic weapons and stuff i mean those can't be used for hunting
sw04252-A_004899-005546 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] unless you're really bad [laughter]
sw04252-A_005546-005851 [laughter]
sw04252-A_006049-006198 oh really
sw04252-A_006330-006599 what kind of gun do you use when you hunt
sw04252-A_006799-006950 uh-huh
sw04252-A_007298-007648 oh really what kind of stuff do you hunt with it
sw04252-A_007898-008073 oh really
sw04252-A_008349-008599 was that [laughter]
sw04252-A_008599-008800 [laughter-yeah]
sw04252-A_008800-009368 when you use a shot gun do you have to like pick uh the pellets out of the [vocalized-noise] when you're i mean
sw04252-A_009474-009599 shot
sw04252-A_009788-009877 but
sw04252-A_009877-010399 yeah i guess i could you could probably hurt your tooth or something
sw04252-A_010797-010998 oh really
sw04252-A_011900-012051 yeah
sw04252-A_012349-012527 [vocalized-noise]
sw04252-A_012527-012678 ugh
sw04252-A_013050-013199 uh-huh
sw04252-A_014129-014427 [laughter] anyway
sw04252-A_014773-015047 yeah Atlanta's not far behind
sw04252-A_015732-015871 yeah
sw04252-A_016649-016798 yeah
sw04252-A_016948-018226 well mean i i feel as if nobody you know if there weren't already han[d]- han[d]- you know so many hand guns and everything prevalent you wouldn't need you know you wouldn't need one for self-defense but it seems like there's so many of them_1
sw04252-A_018226-019100 uh that it's really im[possible]- you know it'd be impossible to it'd be impossible to do anyway i mean people would buy them_1 regardless whether it was uh legal or ill[egal]- illegal i think
sw04252-A_020000-021395 no not at all our house as a matter of fact there's some guy that walked in and stole one of my roommate's bikes while he was in the shower just the other day and that's kind of creepy to we live i live right down town and uh if they'd wanted to you know
sw04252-A_021395-022550 yeah yeah if they wanted to shoot me or something th[ere]- there wouldn't have been any problem mean they just it was in br[oad]- it was during the day too so obviously they don't have a whole lot of fear of uh
sw04252-A_022550-022948 being caught by the police in any[way]- anyway
sw04252-A_023299-023449 uh-huh
sw04252-A_023899-024173 yeah we're getting a dog as a [laughter]
sw04252-A_024548-024701 uh-huh
sw04252-A_025596-025697 um-hum
sw04252-A_025697-026850 it's just crazy i've seen the statis[tics]- statistics on the number of deaths by hand guns in the United States compared with like Canada and and it's just uh i mean they have like you know a handful a year
sw04252-A_026850-027323 uh and it's just outrageous [vocalized-noise] how much how many we have here but
sw04252-A_027323-027799 i don't i don't know if there's anything that can be if gun control would solve that problem
sw04252-A_027954-028147 yeah
sw04252-A_028449-029148 and besides th[at]- i don't think i think the NRA's got such a big lobby that i don't think [laughter] they'd be able to
sw04252-A_029598-029725 yeah
sw04252-B_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04252-B_000028-000147 uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04252-B_000147-000223 [laughter]
sw04252-B_000223-001249 well let's see um generally i don't think there should be much gun control uh i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but
sw04252-B_001249-001700 uh the older i get i think the more i [laughter-believe] [laughter-there] ought to be gun control
sw04252-B_001700-002825 for instance uh just yesterday i go out my front door and somebody had shot a dog out of their front door their subdivision and the thing kind of wound up right where my kids get picked up at the bus stop
sw04252-B_002825-002975 so uh
sw04252-B_002975-004048 yeah it is creepy you know and uh you know it makes me think hey you know there's a lot of a there's a lot of nutcases you know just living even in you know in your subdivision and i mean [laughter]
sw04252-B_004196-005198 yeah see yeah you look like look at automatic weapons and things like that and uh you know clearly they have no no useful hunting purpose and uh
sw04252-B_005198-006549 [laughter-yeah] even then [laughter-if] you're that bad it probably wouldn't help any anyway just [vocalized-noise] help you kill li[ke]- i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with shotguns you know so i can't imagine what it'd be like if they're doing it with automatic weapons
sw04252-B_006549-007449 uh when i hunt i use a twelve gauge shotgun it's uh actually a lot of heavy broacher so it's kind of a short range kind of thing
sw04252-B_007579-008249 uh well i the last time i hunted i hunted turkey actually and uh you know it's
sw04252-B_008249-008972 i wasn't too successful but [laughter] i would've shot one if i'd seen [laughter-one] [laughter] [laughter-so] and
sw04252-B_009250-009949 oh yeah well you're supposed to and yeah you're supposed to sure you have to try to get it out of there
sw04252-B_009949-010071 uh
sw04252-B_010279-010898 well it's actually uh i don't know if this is true anymore but it's lead shot saying that you don't want to
sw04252-B_010898-011201 you don't want eat a piece of lead but um
sw04252-B_011201-012647 yeah i think uh you're supposed to do that also you have to be real careful uh about what the animal's been eating you know like uh if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn that's been uh like you know has mercury on it or something and
sw04252-B_012647-013621 and uh to keep the because_1 the corn gets treated to keep uh insect dusts away so so if you go in and you dig into the pheasant yeah you can get mercury pois[on]-
sw04252-B_013621-014975 but uh so there's i mean there's sort of some risks to that actually uh let me think [vocalized-noise] gun control uh i- i gen[erally]- generally actually [vocalized-noise] since i live so close to DC and since it's the murder capital of the world and you know th[e]-
sw04252-B_014975-015823 yeah well they have guy[s]- i mean i guess they have this Atlanta too but i mean they got guys you know running around you know driving down the street with sub machine guns and stuff and
sw04252-B_015823-017075 you know i don't even let my wife and uh kids go down there anymore unless you know i'm with them or something and then we just stick strictly to the mall area you know we never never venture outside of that area so
sw04252-B_018525-018647 yeah
sw04252-B_018949-020102 doesn't that kind of strike you as [vocalized-noise] especially in big cities that uh you know the law enforcement agencies aren't really capable of of providing the kind of protection that you they should be able to provide
sw04252-B_020648-020773 yeah
sw04252-B_020899-021079 yeah
sw04252-B_021079-021224 uh-huh
sw04252-B_021334-021582 coming at [vocalized-noise] or something you know
sw04252-B_021848-021999 yeah
sw04252-B_022419-022525 yeah
sw04252-B_022650-022846 yeah i
sw04252-B_022846-024049 you know i feel like like you know the when they when they interview these criminals you know the burglars and things they that the two things that they say keep them out of a house best are guns and dogs because_1 they
sw04252-B_024049-024638 yeah so they know there's a dog there they know there's a gun there you know they're probably not going to rob you they'll probably go to the next house
sw04252-B_024638-025927 and uh if they if they suddenly pass a really global law that says you can't have any guns you know there i mean there's guaranteed to be a higher percentage of people just breaking in assuming that these guys don't have any guns and [vocalized-noise]
sw04252-B_026327-026450 yeah
sw04252-B_026828-026999 yeah [noise]
sw04252-B_027250-027399 yeah
sw04252-B_027698-028599 yeah contributing maybe contributing factors too n[obody]- nobody knows about yeah i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm usually pretty skeptical on that kind of stuff these studies
sw04252-B_028950-029907 yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean the[ir]- their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well
sw04253-A_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04253-A_000099-000248 y[ou]- you can go ahead
sw04253-A_002345-002476 yeah
sw04253-A_003623-003801 well i think um
sw04253-A_003801-004173 i don't think really it should go much [vocalized-noise] for
sw04253-A_004173-004423 you know rapist or
sw04253-A_004423-005123 just people who broke into a house nothing like that but i think if someone's killed someone then they deserve to die
sw04253-A_005123-005397 that's how i see it [laughter]
sw04253-A_006849-007026 no Dallas
sw04253-A_007223-007449 uh they have big bees [laughter]
sw04253-A_010496-010647 yeah
sw04253-A_012597-012800 yeah
sw04253-A_013826-013997 [laughter]
sw04253-A_014347-014997 yeah i think um i think it's kind of sad people who a guy can go out and
sw04253-A_014997-016270 completely slaughter a family and there's always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just don't think that's right i think it just makes me
sw04253-A_016270-017119 want the killer to go after that person's family just one person just to see so that that person will see how the other family felt
sw04253-A_017119-018549 just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're going through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone th[ey]- they should deserve to die their life is over too
sw04253-A_018549-019250 i mean they took someone else's life so i don't i just don't think they should deserve to live i think [laughter] everybody who's ever murdered
sw04253-A_019250-019650 well i don't know because there's always people who um
sw04253-A_019650-020147 like fathers who a daughter was raped and they went after the the rapist
sw04253-A_020147-020449 i think that's kind of a good crime there [laughter]
sw04253-A_021766-021921 um-hum
sw04253-A_023449-023598 yeah
sw04253-A_026695-026893 um-hum
sw04253-A_028648-028800 yeah
sw04253-B_000000-000006 [noise]
sw04253-B_000006-000200 well who wants to go first here
sw04253-B_000200-000600 well to me capital punishment is uh
sw04253-B_000701-001450 how should i say it uh i don't think it's it's neither the last thing that it's neither the first uh
sw04253-B_001450-002423 thing that i would [noise] think that needs to be done you know to great le[ngth]- uh how should say it uh not wholesale or something to be shunned at all costs
sw04253-B_002423-002627 but it is uh
sw04253-B_002627-002948 something that i think that uh is uh
sw04253-B_002948-003048 [noise]
sw04253-B_003200-003649 necessary uh under ci[rcumstances]- under many circumstances
sw04253-B_005147-005272 [noise]
sw04253-B_005272-006448 yeah uh my uh i heard a guy one time who explained it uh i[n]- i[n]- in kind of a natural way he said uh said just outside of my door there's a
sw04253-B_006448-006924 there's a hornet's nest and uh that's you're from Atlanta right
sw04253-B_006924-007298 oh excuse me Dallas do they have hornets in Dallas
sw04253-B_007298-008149 okay big bees anyway says there's a hornet's nest right outside of his door and he says i i hate to do it but i had to uh to uh
sw04253-B_008149-009605 to get rid of them_1 and they were just doing what they were supposed to do you know that's what nature equipped them_1 to do and they were doing their thing and but it was pretty threatening to my family so i got rid of them_1 and then he said uh now i have uh he says
sw04253-B_009605-009914 and that was too bad it's too bad i couldn't relocate it
sw04253-B_009914-009965 [noise]
sw04253-B_009965-011399 and he said now i have a uh we have somebody who has the will and the ability to be good but instead they choose to be very bad they can destroy an[y]- lives and and uh uh an[d]- and if not your life your uh [noise]
sw04253-B_011399-012700 mental stability so to speak after they submit you to to uh and he says uh i don't have a lot of feeling for them i have more feeling for the for the hornets than i do for these people that are preying on on uh society [noise]
sw04253-B_012700-013500 so i'm uh let's see the the other question i had i guess was uh i heard one person on the radio say
sw04253-B_013500-014400 uh where do we get the right to put these people death and [noise] or the the corresponding question is where do we get the right to put people in jail at all
sw04253-B_016698-017099 [laughter]
sw04253-B_017099-017304 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04253-B_020348-021019 in my uh you're you're more conservative than some people that i could've talked to but
sw04253-B_021019-022129 i kind of agree with that uh there's there are people out there who just choose to uh like i said based on my little hornet example they choose to do bad then they [vocalized-noise] because they're human have the ability to
sw04253-B_022129-023250 to uh to do immense harm and uh when a person chooses to do that time after time i don't have a lot of uh uh i- i just don't feel like they're
sw04253-B_023250-024398 you know what's there to say uh there are people out there that have made mistakes and they're sorry for it uh i feel bad for them but on the other hand
sw04253-B_024398-024798 anything in nature that doesn't that doesn't
sw04253-B_024950-025399 rid itself of of uh decay
sw04253-B_025399-026831 uh winds up in pretty sad shape and i think that's what we're having now and so we've got some pretty s[ad]- sad conditions out there we've got these guys that go out there and and uh do drug uh uh how should i say it wholesale murders
sw04253-B_026831-026996 and
sw04253-B_026996-028154 what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems they'll they'll come out to uh to uh
sw04253-B_028154-028726 people and they'll say what you you have to uh we're going to enact stricter laws on the rest of you
sw04253-B_028726-029353 you know and and so uh i don't know i i've i've i- i guess you can say i'm
sw04253-B_029353-029840 pretty strongly in favor of capital punishment as long as as long as it's not uh [noise]
sw04254-A_000000-000100 [noise]
sw04254-A_000100-000450 [vocalized-noise] i guess that was it um
sw04254-A_000450-000970 i guess the uh it's interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh
sw04254-A_000970-001625 we just merged with another um division in our company and actually have different slightly different benefits
sw04254-A_001625-002151 so i guess the the things i'd look for um kind of things i call like safety net
sw04254-A_002151-002531 features like health insurance and uh possibly
sw04254-A_002531-003028 um retirement pension sorts of incentives
sw04254-A_003028-003876 and then i guess there's the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimb[ursement]- tui[tion]- like tuition reimbursement or uh
sw04254-A_003876-004047 um
sw04254-A_004047-004700 maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be
sw04254-A_004700-004896 [vocalized-noise] be interested in seeing
sw04254-A_005349-005498 um-hum
sw04254-A_007496-007626 um
sw04254-A_007969-008599 that's interesting yeah i- i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh
sw04254-A_008700-009100 um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh
sw04254-A_009100-009772 you know there wasn't really it wasn't really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like [vocalized-noise]
sw04254-A_009772-010028 a doctorate in something and then you could
sw04254-A_010128-010479 you know look at the you'd be eligible for the uh
sw04254-A_010581-010749 you know the uh
sw04254-A_010749-010999 more important position than
sw04254-A_011127-011250 yeah
sw04254-A_011250-011900 well no i'm not i'm sorry i'm at uh i'm actually doing um consulting in the commercial
sw04254-A_011900-012124 in in industry
sw04254-A_012830-012972 um
sw04254-A_013498-013700 well that's interesting
sw04254-A_014148-014448 yeah but it seems like other uh
sw04254-A_014448-015147 the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection
sw04254-A_015147-015298 or
sw04254-A_015848-016201 oh okay so it's not viewed as
sw04254-A_016201-016323 that's interesting
sw04254-A_016947-017448 um actually i never thought of that i- i- i- i guess i assumed that's part of the uh
sw04254-A_017448-017698 package but um
sw04254-A_017698-018422 i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh
sw04254-A_018422-018796 um as long as you know it's not uh
sw04254-A_018796-019931 i g[uess]- what's more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because_1 a lot of times we're in projects whe[re]- you know where the dates are critical and it's it's a little harder to plan a vacation
sw04254-A_019931-020147 when you're in that kind of environment
sw04254-A_020549-020699 um
sw04254-A_020699-020877 it's good
sw04254-A_021299-021499 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04254-A_021850-022796 so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a [vocalized-noise] is that [vocalized-noise] i don't know if that's considered a benefit it's just in kind of part of the environment you're in [vocalized-noise]
sw04254-A_023274-023399 right
sw04254-A_024045-024198 um
sw04254-A_025150-025350 yeah huh
sw04254-A_025475-025600 interesting
sw04254-A_026200-026929 yeah it it's only been a problem i guess in our organization seems like um about the year after i joined was when they started
sw04254-A_026929-027524 passing on a lot higher percentage of the increases they were getting from the carriers but i've got an HMO
sw04254-A_027524-027826 um with mine because_1 i've got [vocalized-noise]

sw04254-B_004671-004874 yeah but
sw04254-B_004874-005949 i think it's important to have some place to go over the years in a within a company uh i work for uh

sw04254-B_006398-006748 and [noise] with my job

sw04254-B_007200-007575 what you're hired in as is what you end up as
sw04254-B_007575-008000 and the benefits are okay but i'd rather have more security
sw04254-B_010700-011173 a[re]- are you uh with with a university system now
sw04254-B_011173-011430 you are well [vocalized-noise]
sw04254-B_011873-012100 um wha[t]-
sw04254-B_012100-012449 when i say it was a i like security but
sw04254-B_012449-012549 [noise]
sw04254-B_012549-012998 what we did was a uh mostly radar some
sw04254-B_012998-013598 counter stuff for Russians and things so i don't re[ally]- exactly have a whole lot of [laughter-security] [laughter-right] [laughter-now]
sw04254-B_013598-013772 since uh
sw04254-B_013772-014199 they're not doing so good they're not a threat anymore so
sw04254-B_015097-015969 yeah i'm i'm [noise] most all those systems are the same they came were originated Soviet Union so
sw04254-B_016273-016978 it's not real good you have good good benefits like vacation days does that mean much to you
sw04254-B_019950-020101 [vocalized-noise]
sw04254-B_020101-020724 we have it pretty good because_1 i we we take our vacation anytime we want by the hour by the day

sw04254-B_024231-024802 we charge you know about four accounting purposes to the projects so there's no way that
sw04254-B_024802-025224 that you can take off vacation and charge it back to the project

sw04255-A_006474-006625 um-hum
sw04255-A_006731-006982 is the weather pretty cold
sw04255-A_007179-008028 oh my goodness it it's probably about si[xty]- uh sixty five degrees here [laughter]
sw04255-A_008028-008750 [laughter] yeah it reached eighty degrees two days ago and i was in shorts and a T-shirt and i went running
sw04255-A_008750-009650 uh yeah [laughter] and i had the wrong shoes i've just started running i i been into weigh lifting and all and i just started running and i had the wrong tennis shoes
sw04255-A_009947-010688 well um i found out what a difference it [laughter-makes] i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in
sw04255-A_010688-011700 and it didn't give me the support i needed i had too much shock and too much jolting on my knees and my ankles and my joints and my lower back
sw04255-A_011846-012500 oh well um down the sidewalks and uh on the side on the grass the side roads
sw04255-A_012500-013582 but um i was running on the track and it's just carpet with uh a little thin thing of padding and then concrete and in those tennis shoes i had Reebok's on an[d]-
sw04255-A_013582-014027 yeah Reebok walking shoes and they just did [laughter-not] do the job at all
sw04255-A_014027-014539 so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints
sw04255-A_014539-014900 so i went to The Athlete a shoe store here in Tyler
sw04255-A_014900-016150 and tried on several different pairs of shoes i tried Asics and uh Nike Air and uh New Balance and some different type of tennis shoes that are running
sw04255-A_016150-016750 and uh finally got some Nike Air because_1 they have the the air pockets in the front and the back
sw04255-A_016750-017750 and i didn't think that it would make any difference you know i thought well that's just a sales pitch you know and Nike's real expensive because_1 they're always putting out new things and you just pay for the brand
sw04255-A_017750-018845 but i tried on i compared the way that felt to all the other brands and the prices d[ifference]- difference wasn't that much you know maybe ten dollars difference
sw04255-A_018845-020050 and so i finally bought some Nike Air Skylon 2 and so it it they just are wonderful i[t]- it i can run further now because i'm not in pain [laughter]

sw04256-B_022998-023499 [laughter] [vocalized-noise] well that's awfully small cheese if you ask me then [laughter]
sw04256-B_024450-025776 yeah there was a lot of uh thought put into that because_1 i i- i because_1 when i go to other new facilities whether it be uh uh uh uh McDonald Douglas some of the other new facilities i've been to there's
sw04256-B_025776-026448 and little things that they point out to me when i was walking around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that
sw04256-B_026601-027353 yeah oh well the architect tries to throw it in but uh sometimes i wonder when they put back the people that's supposed to be monitoring the building
sw04256-B_027353-027632 uh how much reins they got
sw04256-B_027632-027848 but they give them an award

sw04257-A_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04257-A_000028-000426 um at what age did your father enter the [vocalized-noise] nursing home
sw04257-A_000699-000849 gosh
sw04257-A_002045-002203 right
sw04257-A_004245-005400 i tell you i worked in home health care with the elderly um for a while and uh while i was in college and it was a very i mean i enjoyed my job but i- i worked a
sw04257-A_005400-005798 yes three days on and four days off is what my schedule was and
sw04257-A_005798-006999 and um i'm a compassionate person and uh physically strong but when i got off my three day shift i mean you know you couldn't have kept me there another minute i just had to go [laughter]
sw04257-A_007850-008072 it um-hum
sw04257-A_008450-009900 i i think that's almost necessary i and it's interesting that compassion has got to be a required quality but then they yet they have to have the ability to isolate themselves from too much too much compassion
sw04257-A_009900-010050 um
sw04257-A_010174-010350 i could imagine
sw04257-A_010450-010650 oh of course uh
sw04257-A_010650-010800 uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04257-A_011949-012100 um-hum
sw04257-A_012699-012799 [vocalized-noise]
sw04257-A_014200-015650 that's true and i think it would be i would think it would be helpful to the patient to um be housed with uh patients with similar uh ha[d]- you know similar problems
sw04257-A_015650-015898 if you will you know excuse the word
sw04257-A_015898-016400 just so that they could relate to one another and and wouldn't you know be
sw04257-A_016749-016973 i know [laughter]
sw04257-A_017549-018349 i- i tell you i was at an uh convalescent home last week um a three hundred and twenty five patient convalescent home
sw04257-A_018349-019250 and i could not believe how feisty these people were i had ne[ver]- i had never been in a group atmosphere when i was in home health care it was a one-on-one ratio
sw04257-A_019250-020026 and these folks were you know about to go to the mat over TV stations that they had chosen or
sw04257-A_020026-020773 uh arguing over whether or not their meals were cooked enough and and as if the another patient could have done something about it
sw04257-A_020773-021445 and i find that psychologically very interesting because_1 i i feel from my perspective that it would be a a manifestation of their own frus[tration]-
sw04257-A_021445-021550 [noise]
sw04257-A_021550-021898 and uh i'm going to ignore that click if you heard it uh
sw04257-A_021898-022569 and and that um would would i don't know that that frustration would be preventable in [noise]
sw04257-A_022569-022600 [noise]
sw04257-A_022600-023171 even in the one-on-one ratio i worked in my patients were very frustrated and very upset
sw04257-A_023799-023949 [noise]
sw04257-A_024148-024450 oh that i'm sure that was a load off your mind
sw04257-A_025798-026700 um-hum what um do the[y]- did you find um that they offered sufficient dietary maintenance that would be something i would
sw04257-A_026700-026848 would uh
sw04257-A_026950-027099 [laughter]
sw04257-A_027798-027947 um-hum
sw04257-A_029600-029800 [laughter]
sw04257-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04257-B_000348-000800 um he was around seventy nine i believe
sw04257-B_000800-002128 and um but it's a big decision to make but um you know people say because one day they're they look like they're doing real well and the next they're just you know awful in diapers and the whole bit
sw04257-B_002128-002849 and um uh they can be mentally sane one day and just look perfectly normal and then the next day they're just
sw04257-B_002849-004328 are weeks off o[f]- off of it and until you take care of a person personally there were three my mom and i and our kids would help us some and it was just awful to take care of a person that is that way
sw04257-B_005249-005426 uh uh very strenuous
sw04257-B_005601-005725 um-hum
sw04257-B_005725-005867 um-hum
sw04257-B_006200-006374 um-hum
sw04257-B_006731-006843 [laughter]
sw04257-B_006843-007849 right yes but i don't know how the the uh people at the nursing homes handle it day in and day out truthfully because of the physical
sw04257-B_007849-008572 strain uh as well as uh you know em[otionally]- well they they have to build walls emotionally but
sw04257-B_008773-008871 yeah
sw04257-B_009028-009249 oh yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04257-B_009548-009948 um-hum from the situation um-hum
sw04257-B_009948-010683 was very difficult for me at times as the as the daughter to you know to a special person
sw04257-B_010683-011723 but a[nyway]- anyway he he um the the requirements for the nursing home were first of all well of course the cleanliness and the care
sw04257-B_011723-012371 you know what type of care do they need it depends if you you know if you need the bed total bed care
sw04257-B_012371-013679 or if he could if they could be up and around it all depends on the type of nursing home they have the ones where they live in apartments even and just get their meals and care there you know that way
sw04257-B_013679-014296 so that that's one of the i mean it just depends on the patients
sw04257-B_015298-015450 right
sw04257-B_015600-015749 right
sw04257-B_016100-016250 um-hum
sw04257-B_016250-017650 except bless their hearts they're [laughter] [laughter-usually] so senile they don't really do anything [vocalized-noise] love each other a[nd]- and all they do is fight with each other that was i found in my [laughter-father] you know all those old people would just fight with you it was a riot
sw04257-B_018250-018378 um-hum
sw04257-B_018625-018826 uh-huh
sw04257-B_019048-019249 um-hum

sw04257-B_021499-021599 yeah
sw04257-B_021735-022000 oh that's fine yeah
sw04257-B_023049-024200 uh-huh it is for them bless their hearts it is very frustrating but but by the same token it's it's the one my father was in was wonderful care
sw04257-B_024200-024348 and uh
sw04257-B_024348-025076 yeah it is and uh just knowing they're daily taken care of as far as uh physically and uh
sw04257-B_025076-025449 you know th[ey]- they kept him clean and they kept him
sw04257-B_025449-025897 and uh kept up with his medicine and all it's a big thing
sw04257-B_026548-027300 it was pretty good it was nothing to write home about it's typical you know it's typical um
sw04257-B_027300-027650 oh what do you want to say you know um
sw04257-B_027749-029173 commercial you know and uh it was it was fine they had but they had a recreation director that was pretty good there and she made sure they had their little get togethers and parties most everyday she had something going on for them
sw04257-B_029173-029904 either ceramics or they did ceramics which i never thought my dad would do but he did a little bit of it [vocalized-noise]
sw04258-A_000000-000057 [noise]
sw04258-A_000146-000261 did you attend public school

sw04258-A_001981-002126 uh-huh
sw04258-A_003504-003948 yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily
sw04258-A_005049-005247 okay
sw04258-A_006047-006249 yeah i never
sw04258-A_006249-006399 yeah
sw04258-A_006873-007299 yes vocational education we called it
sw04258-A_008626-008777 uh-huh
sw04258-A_009249-009399 uh-huh
sw04258-A_009898-010050 uh-huh
sw04258-A_010050-010750 and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or
sw04258-A_010848-010974 uh-huh
sw04258-A_011569-011699 um-hum
sw04258-A_013352-013469 um
sw04258-A_013677-013824 oh
sw04258-A_013929-014052 uh-huh
sw04258-A_014327-014474 uh-huh
sw04258-A_014599-014998 [laughter] that's kind of technical so he could
sw04258-A_014998-015323 h[im]- it was him yeah [laughter]
sw04258-A_016971-017103 um-hum
sw04258-A_017498-017799 uh-huh were already paying this guy
sw04258-A_017899-018172 yeah yeah uh
sw04258-A_018172-018477 i did i did and uh
sw04258-A_018477-018772 i felt i got a very
sw04258-A_018772-019298 i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general uh
sw04258-A_019298-019848 but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations
sw04258-A_019848-020199 um uh in our case it think it was
sw04258-A_020199-020899 you know the teachers uh again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really
sw04258-A_020899-021201 do the job um
sw04258-A_021201-021700 i'm sort of i have a two year old son now and so i'm starting to think about
sw04258-A_021700-022549 education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole uh
sw04258-A_022549-023475 the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures uh especially for small children
sw04258-A_023475-024398 uh it just seems like it's not the way they're going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do
sw04258-A_024398-025186 you know i mean it seems like the the style of teaching that we we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics
sw04258-A_025288-025799 in just in terms of uh student teacher ratios um
sw04258-A_026350-026684 um no so far i'm just whining
sw04258-A_026684-026900 [laughter]
sw04258-A_026900-027448 i haven't done anything constructive yet uh we fantasize about homeschooling
sw04258-A_027448-027670 but uh
sw04258-A_027670-027848 we probably won't
sw04258-A_027848-028246 although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun
sw04258-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04258-B_000249-000697 i did attend public school for all but one year i uh
sw04258-B_000697-002100 went to a Catholic school for one year found that uh it did not agree with me or i did not ag[ree]- agree with it and uh spent the rest of my education in public schools
sw04258-B_002100-003400 uh i had mixed feelings on it uh because i thought that there was a greater range of students that a public school has to uh
sw04258-B_003400-003629 has to address
sw04258-B_003872-005150 right and and the the programs have to be wider uh when i went to the Catholic high school uh there was nothing but a college preparatory course
sw04258-B_005150-005800 and in the public school there were uh a couple of different courses the uh
sw04258-B_005800-007100 the the so-called business course uh the college prep course and then there was the uh [laughter] the uh the the basic uh gas station manager track uh [laughter] you know
sw04258-B_007100-007246 right
sw04258-B_007348-007680 and [noise] i'm not sure
sw04258-B_007680-007899 that uh
sw04258-B_008001-008728 the college prep course was any worse in a public school than it would've been in a private school
sw04258-B_008728-009995 but i think that the teachers were spread a little more thin because they weren't always able to focus on the areas that they taught best
sw04258-B_010698-011799 well a little bit of both uh the school wasn't very crowded when i went there although it's since gotten it's since gotten worse but uh there were
sw04258-B_011799-012250 there were some very good math teachers there there was one uh
sw04258-B_012250-013566 a science teacher in particular there who ended up having to teach a i- i can't remember what course it was but it was really unsuitable uh it was some sort of uh
sw04258-B_013566-014052 shop or mechanical drawing class and he just
sw04258-B_014052-014700 he kn[ow]- he didn't know much about it but they figured he was a warm body in a room
sw04258-B_015070-015279 r[ight]- right
sw04258-B_015279-015700 and i don't think that uh
sw04258-B_015700-016696 i do[n't]- i don't think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a
sw04258-B_016696-017599 trained machinist to tea[ch]- teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it
sw04258-B_017750-017874 right
sw04258-B_018027-018273 did you go to a public school
sw04258-B_018998-019150 um-hum
sw04258-B_020747-020898 [vocalized-noise]
sw04258-B_021429-021575 um-hum
sw04258-B_023146-023300 um-hum
sw04258-B_023430-023599 sure
sw04258-B_024348-024498 right
sw04258-B_025548-026296 um-hum so have you started looking into uh alternative schools like Montessories
sw04258-B_026696-027028 [laughter]
sw04258-B_027028-027149 uh-huh
sw04258-B_027377-027527 um-hum
sw04258-B_027799-027949 right
sw04258-B_028249-028949 i can see a lot of advantages to homeschooling but uh
sw04258-B_028949-029895 th[ere's]- i[t's]- it's interesting there's uh someone here in Rhode Island who is very disgusted with the school system
sw04259-A_000001-000100 [vocalized-noise]
sw04259-A_000349-001399 well for myself it's the printed media um only on occasion do i i watch the television for any news because by that time it's so glossed over it's not even funny
sw04259-A_001399-001748 um the radio i've yet to find
sw04259-A_001874-002228 [laughter] so true so true
sw04259-A_002549-002700 yeah
sw04259-A_002700-003230 that's right you know details at eleven while the earth is cracking in half
sw04259-A_003230-004300 you know um but myself i go for the printed media and well one one new show which i do watch on occasion is McNeal Lehrer on public television
sw04259-A_004300-004896 and that's because they can take the time to get into the new story and they don't go for the hype and all that stuff
sw04259-A_004896-005849 it appears to me that the news media for the most part is uh doing its darndest to appeal to the lowest common denominator and
sw04259-A_005950-006181 oh buddy
sw04259-A_006181-006380 [laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah] [laughter-there] [laughter-you] [laughter-go]
sw04259-A_006380-006632 [laughter]
sw04259-A_006632-006859 so true so true
sw04259-A_007159-007287 yeah
sw04259-A_007287-007530 yeah i always liked all things considered
sw04259-A_007530-007640 [vocalized-noise]
sw04259-A_007794-007963 um-hum
sw04259-A_008305-009181 yeah yeah same story here i uh happened to cross that that beauty of a of a station when uh
sw04259-A_009181-010012 i was with a new car and all i had was an AM radio and i cursed the time for a while and then i found that and i didn't want to go back to FM
sw04259-A_010012-010186 yeah but uh
sw04259-A_010404-010730 oh you lucky dogs we get it out of the
sw04259-A_010855-010982 oh
sw04259-A_011203-011515 well you get it one way you get it another
sw04259-A_011515-012262 yeah but myself well li[ke]- for example with this you know the democratic race we got going here
sw04259-A_012262-013150 the different candidates we got all this other stuff all i'm seeing are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues so to speak
sw04259-A_013286-013424 yeah
sw04259-A_014153-014297 ah
sw04259-A_014297-014416 yeah
sw04259-A_015324-016057 oh yeah i mean heard more i heard more about Jennifer Flowers than i hear[d]- i have heard about Bill Clinton's uh platform on health care
sw04259-A_016057-016212 yeah
sw04259-A_016374-016660 oh yeah [laughter-thank] you [laughter]
sw04259-A_016660-017442 yeah that's right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light that's a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes
sw04259-A_017665-017905 hey there you go [laughter]
sw04259-A_017905-018190 i'll make that into a tag line in my system
sw04259-A_018190-018357 all right
sw04259-A_018357-018770 [noise] oh goodness but i don't know for the most part
sw04259-A_018770-019760 i see the media for the most part pandering like i said to the lowest common denominator because when it gets down to the nitty-gritty and the brass tacks it gets real unpopular
sw04259-A_019760-020301 and it looses advertisers and it looses starts hurting in the budget so it has to cater somewhere
sw04259-A_020411-020654 yeah infotainment
sw04259-A_020813-021061 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04259-A_021233-021484 yeah that's true
sw04259-A_022344-023011 um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any [vocalized-noise] you know source of the media do anything really gutsy
sw04259-A_023011-023555 we had a situation here in Des Moines when um it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended
sw04259-A_023555-024101 that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which [vocalized-noise] excepted
sw04259-A_024101-024773 which depicted the [vocalized-noise] of animals very much akin to the uh victims of Jeffrey Dahlmer
sw04259-A_024773-025670 well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising
sw04259-A_025784-026012 you know socked it right to them_1
sw04259-A_026012-026255 and that's i guess uh
sw04259-A_026255-026821 something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not going to get the news
sw04259-A_027126-027264 yeah
sw04259-A_027459-027577 well
sw04259-A_027919-028161 yeah and that's unfortunate
sw04259-A_028477-028840 yeah they they've got to work harder because right now
sw04259-A_028840-029530 when you challenge funding for public radio or public television you're no longer being typecast as trying to kill big bird
sw04259-A_029530-029778 you know they're uh
sw04259-A_029778-029863 i [vocalized-noise]
sw04259-B_000000-000416 [noise] do you listen to TV mostly or radio or newspaper
sw04259-B_001333-001459 um-hum
sw04259-B_001597-001980 but it's also little sound bites on TV they don't really tell you much [laughter]
sw04259-B_002082-002821 e[xcept]- except for giving you sports and weather and telling you the story is going to be coming just after this commercial
sw04259-B_003143-003321 yes yes [laughter]
sw04259-B_004199-004303 yeah

sw04259-B_010098-010474 well out here we get it uh both AM and FM
sw04259-B_010584-011258 though though the FM cuts off at eight A M and then you have to switch over to AM if you want to continue listening to the news
sw04259-B_011434-011551 yeah
sw04259-B_013002-013593 oh yeah yeah de[finitely]- definitely haven't been any issues and ninety percent of the stories you hear
sw04259-B_013593-013777 even you know
sw04259-B_013777-014251 you know i- i we got the AP news wire at work which is also a very good source of news
sw04259-B_014251-015392 and most of the stories there are how well each candidate did in which place and where they [vocalized-noise] and you know what's the latest scandal but nothing about what they stand for and
sw04259-B_015392-015575 issues or
sw04259-B_016035-016182 yeah
sw04259-B_016182-016516 and George Bush forget it [laughter]
sw04259-B_016516-016729 he doesn't have a platform
sw04259-B_017429-017753 no no that's a thousand pointless lies
sw04259-B_019750-019940 well i[t]- it
sw04259-B_019940-020074 yeah
sw04259-B_020226-020485 yeah new[s]- news is entertainment
sw04259-B_020627-020915 no not even infotainment entertainment
sw04259-B_020915-021319 i mean the largest segments are sports and weather
sw04259-B_021498-022428 and there's there's not really that much of what's going on and the only stories that really get talked about are the ones that have good video clips to go with them_1
sw04259-B_023495-023608 yeah
sw04259-B_024698-024823 uh-huh
sw04259-B_025126-025238 yes
sw04259-B_025719-025853 um-hum
sw04259-B_026757-027477 well that's one ni[ce]- nice thing about the public radio and public television is for the most part they're some what distanced from that but
sw04259-B_027477-027979 unfortunately not completely these days since that's where a lot of their funding is coming from is corporate underwriting
sw04259-B_027979-028297 but they at least make the effort to be
sw04259-B_028297-028539 distance themselves from that
sw04259-B_029478-029597 um-hum
sw04260-A_000000-000189 [noise] in the evening back there now isn't it
sw04260-A_000189-000428 what time is it back there right now
sw04260-A_000428-000619 oh okay
sw04260-A_000619-000935 so have you been golfing yet this year
sw04260-A_001938-002072 uh-huh
sw04260-A_002319-002780 oh good yeah i'm not that mu[ch]- i've gone about i guess about twenty twenty five times
sw04260-A_002780-003178 no i'm not a beginner but i'm not a [laughter-novice] [laughter-either]
sw04260-A_003278-004177 yeah yeah it takes quite a bit i used to go just about every day during this one summer and i did really good and then the more i practiced the worse i got [laughter]
sw04260-A_004177-004515 so i got frustrated but i heard that happens to everyone
sw04260-A_004984-005271 um we couldn't start playing right now
sw04260-A_005271-005492 there's a few courses open
sw04260-A_005492-006124 um pretty much until end of probably October and if it snows or not
sw04260-A_006124-006383 so it is a quite a long season
sw04260-A_007398-007521 oh
sw04260-A_008247-008397 [laughter]
sw04260-A_009791-010213 yeah because_1 you don't know for su[re]- can you tell if you're slice much on those
sw04260-A_010213-010351 [vocalized-noise]
sw04260-A_010466-010650 [laughter]
sw04260-A_010650-010825 [laughter]
sw04260-A_010825-010968 uh-huh
sw04260-A_012143-012436 uh-huh do you use your own balls on those
sw04260-A_012436-012632 on the net
sw04260-A_012632-013015 yeah when you hit against a net and indoor [vocalized-noise]
sw04260-A_013015-013210 oh they okay pr[ovide]-
sw04260-A_014349-014756 yeah i played that once [vocalized-noise] Pebble Beach i played
sw04260-A_014860-015237 um no no i wish [laughter] the the screen one
sw04260-A_015437-015980 yeah well they were trying it out here is i did it about gee six or seven years ago
sw04260-A_015980-016409 and so i don't how much more advanced they got when i tried it it was all right
sw04260-A_016409-016536 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04260-A_016641-017262 maybe they improved on that because when i did it it was all right but it wasn't that impressive
sw04260-A_017979-018261 yeah i kind of experienced it once
sw04260-A_019346-019640 oh [laughter-really] retired
sw04260-A_020135-020273 [vocalized-noise]
sw04260-A_020273-020513 you imagine doing that [laughter]
sw04260-A_021368-021515 oh really
sw04260-A_021978-022369 wow i didn't know that would hu[rt]- hu[rt]- hurt you standing all the time
sw04260-A_022929-023057 huh
sw04260-A_024158-024347 [laughter]
sw04260-A_024599-025054 that's why i've never {chored} so much in my life until i went golfing [laughter]
sw04260-A_025234-025389 no it's just
sw04260-A_025389-025912 just once in bu[t]- i'll probably go about three or four times during the summer i don't even have my own clubs
sw04260-A_025912-026426 i usually get a hold of someone that lets me use them_1 i really enjoy the game
sw04260-A_026740-026887 oh yeah
sw04260-A_027861-027972 [vocalized-noise]
sw04260-A_027972-028625 [laughter]
sw04260-A_028625-028748 uh-huh
sw04260-A_028918-029106 has your wife golfed
sw04260-B_000000-000133 [noise]
sw04260-B_000133-000291 pardon
sw04260-B_000291-000537 it's uh about seven thirty
sw04260-B_000537-000639 yeah
sw04260-B_000827-002015 uh no actually i'm uh quite a beginner i'm very green i just got my first set of clubs this year for Christmas but i have uh gone out to the driving range once or twice
sw04260-B_002015-002334 to uh see if i can work on my swing a little bit
sw04260-B_002736-002849 yeah
sw04260-B_003090-003365 little bit more experience though
sw04260-B_004089-004273 really [laughter]
sw04260-B_004465-005051 now how how much out of the year or how long out of the year can you play where you live
sw04260-B_005415-005554 uh-huh
sw04260-B_005927-006174 oh that's not bad uh-huh
sw04260-B_006345-006971 i would have thought that uh this time of the year here i might be able to get out a little bit but uh
sw04260-B_006971-007483 Winter seems to be dragging on up here and we have snow right now
sw04260-B_007483-008313 but uh i noticed a lot of the driving ranges outdoor driving ranges do um i[f]- if you want to play [laughter-outside] in the cold
sw04260-B_008313-009477 you can you can sweep the snow off the uh tees and and play from there but we also have a lot of indoor driving ranges and and that's a little bit strange getting used to swinging the club inside and
sw04260-B_009477-009867 and uh hitting the ball into a net instead of letting it fly
sw04260-B_010154-010902 um i can tell i can because i slice so [laughter-terribly] bad [laughter] i'm still trying to work on that
sw04260-B_010902-012219 but uh i don't know i've noticed that it's mostly the real beginners like myself that that will do that it seems like the real experienced people'll wait um until they can play outside and really hit the ball
sw04260-B_012491-012744 i i'm sorry using ow[n]- b[alls]- my own balls
sw04260-B_012909-014021 you can get a bucket of balls like you would on an outdoor [vocalized-noise] we're going to try something new we haven't done this yet a a few of us are going to go to a place where they have big uh video screens
sw04260-B_014021-014448 and they advertise courses like Pebble Beach and a few others
sw04260-B_014448-014666 did you do that once
sw04260-B_014666-014964 oh real[ly]- the real Pebble Beach
sw04260-B_014964-015145 yeah
sw04260-B_015145-015506 oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common
sw04260-B_015892-016010 uh-huh
sw04260-B_016348-016714 was it is it like fairly realistic or
sw04260-B_017180-018059 no well we haven't done it yet but uh it it sounds like fun and it looked like fun so we figure we'd just go do it once to see what it's like
sw04260-B_018165-019464 but i'm getting kind of {antsy} to to really polish my stroke up a little bit more my father-in-law's a real avid golfer he plays six days a week three hundred and sixty five [laughter-days] out of the year
sw04260-B_019464-020401 yeah yeah he's retired and living out on the west coast where it's warm enough that he can play outside all year round
sw04260-B_020401-021445 no i don't think i can it's funny because he uh hi[s]- his knees are shot from uh he was a surgeon and his knees are shot from being on his feet all day everyday
sw04260-B_021445-022047 and uh he has artificial knees he doesn't get around to well but he still plays eighteen [laughter-holes] of golf everyday
sw04260-B_022325-023008 evidently yeah so he uh i don't know he's got his own little golf cart that he putts over to the country club in and
sw04260-B_023008-023827 and he gets around okay in fact i did go out with him whe[n]- we were out there for Christmas and went right after i got my clubs i did go out with him once and
sw04260-B_023827-024654 we uh knocked the ball right it was pretty dull for him seeing how i had to hit it about twenty times before i got onto the green [laughter]
sw04260-B_024967-025315 yeah uh do you belong to a club or anything
sw04260-B_025848-025980 yeah
sw04260-B_026336-027080 well i'm left handed and i found that i couldn't always get a hold of good left handed clubs or any left handed clubs whatsoever really
sw04260-B_027080-028060 and i did [laughter-try] [laughter-it] once i'm hopele[ss]- i'm not even i can't do anything with my right hand but i did try using right handed clubs once and i[t]- it was so awkward for me
sw04260-B_028060-028915 so i i figured i[t]- it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isn't very good
sw04260-B_029057-029863 um a little bit here and there not a whole lot she's uh she used to play more but um her shoulders started bothering her
sw04261-A_000000-000842 [noise] served on jury duty but it's ironic because i have a summons here for the thirtieth which is the Monday after next and i'll be a little more authoritative on this after then
sw04261-A_000842-000995 but um
sw04261-A_001913-002057 um
sw04261-A_002309-003505 yeah i would think that um sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know there's a whole bunch of evidence that's supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things
sw04261-A_003505-004048 it would um seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well
sw04261-A_005661-006145 yeah there's so much variation in sentencing like this guy recently that um
sw04261-A_006145-006730 there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area uh
sw04261-A_007092-007935 and then here they've gone and um no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that
sw04261-A_008938-010089 yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that um criminals be sentenced to some sort of a uh a means of paying for their um incarceration
sw04261-A_010089-010802 i think that's that's reasonable those of us on this side of uh the justice system have to pay pay our way through life
sw04261-A_011584-011759 yeah absolutely
sw04261-A_013224-013364 really
sw04261-A_013855-014315 yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that c[ould]- could be done um
sw04261-A_014315-014694 you know with people like that whether totally unskilled or not
sw04261-A_016420-016571 that's a tough one
sw04261-A_016571-017550 we seem to as a group have such a hard time all agreeing and what is it they say about democracy the flaws of democracy [noise] is that nobody will um
sw04261-A_017550-018097 agree on anything or it's hard to get everybody to agree on something i can't there's some saying i can't remember what it is
sw04261-A_019820-020067 yeah really that's a really good point
sw04261-A_021636-022280 how is it now do you know do they have it so that if um some certain percentage agrees then or
sw04261-A_024210-024349 hum
sw04261-A_024853-025075 more time and expense
sw04261-A_025593-025766 very interesting
sw04261-A_025766-026527 yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today i'm certainly no one to have the answers
sw04261-A_028606-028788 hum
sw04261-A_028788-029008 unbelievably i
sw04261-A_029148-029560 yeah and they're all automatic too for a long ways at least
sw04261-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04261-B_000745-001625 [laughter] um i haven't either but here recently i w[ith]- with the advent of court TV i've watched a [laughter-little] [laughter-bit] more than
sw04261-B_001625-002313 uh than i would have a probably a year or so ago so i i've been getting a little more interested in court procedures too
sw04261-B_004025-004624 well uh i guess it could be but i- i- i agree with you in that to the extent that i i think i[t]-
sw04261-B_004624-005700 it largely would be more uniform i think uh as a opposed to a a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas
sw04261-B_006449-006576 yeah
sw04261-B_006685-007043 uh i think it was yeah Houston i've been hearing about that yeah
sw04261-B_007868-008176 yeah plus he was getting a lot of uh
sw04261-B_008176-008987 uh criticisms i guess for by different groups you know about just being inhumane you know that sort of thing
sw04261-B_010722-011699 yeah and and the costs are real high i guess of both uh o[f]- of keeping someone in prison and going through the trial procedure the whole whole works uh
sw04261-B_011699-012301 and and that just comes out of the tax money and uh in a lot of cases the uh
sw04261-B_012301-013287 uh the person being tried sometimes you know they do have the means to uh to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to uh to keep them
sw04261-B_013287-013820 or to perform some sort of more work than is is currently done in most prisons
sw04261-B_014644-015187 yeah yeah [vocalized-noise] they need to make some adjustments on that um
sw04261-B_015187-015849 uh th[e]- the other question i guess that that to be addressed is uh whether uh
sw04261-B_015849-016217 a a verdict should should require unanimous uh
sw04261-B_016217-016407 uh decision
sw04261-B_017724-017948 yeah it
sw04261-B_017948-018923 yeah i- i i don't know but it seems like um [vocalized-noise] everything is so stacked and in favor of the criminal that it's a shame to have
sw04261-B_018923-019934 a a majority that would vote uh guilty and to have just one dissenting vote could jeopardize the whole uh whole process or who[le]- whole verdict to
sw04261-B_020083-020345 and it seems like it should just be
sw04261-B_020345-021146 uh some come up with some sort of majority maybe um uh maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because_1 it's
sw04261-B_021146-021678 it's hard to get every single person to to agree on anything like you say
sw04261-B_022147-023462 well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not it's a hung jury and uh they're asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually it's uh
sw04261-B_023462-024264 uh not unanimous even by one vote it's sometimes i- i think it's either thrown out or they have to go for retrial
sw04261-B_024264-024886 um even if just one person is is holding out or can't be convinced to uh to vote guilty
sw04261-B_024886-025004 [noise]
sw04261-B_025004-025549 yeah i mean that's really a r[eally]- r[eally]- really a lot of cost to uh to bring that to trial again
sw04261-B_026502-027257 yeah the[y]- it needs some some revising and i heard that this is a little unrelated i guess but i heard uh
sw04261-B_027257-028153 what was it the other day it said to for someone who's convicted and put on death row it was i[t]- it was up in the millions what it costs
sw04261-B_028153-028884 to keep that person and then to execute that person at the time y[ou]- y[ou]- you know it usually takes years to do that
sw04261-B_028884-029272 [noise] just all the appeals processes that goes on and
sw04261-B_029272-029792 yeah and that was just uh amazing that they were talking about a millions of dollars per
sw04262-A_000000-001006 [noise] okay well two things that come to mind with me first um is one i think more emphasis should placed on
sw04262-A_001006-002332 the the English and and some of the basics i mean we we can get so specialized into you know extracurricular activities that we've got kids graduating high school that don't know how to read and write
sw04262-A_002332-002598 and such like that
sw04262-A_003608-003686 um-hum
sw04262-A_003804-003941 yes it does
sw04262-A_004352-004822 well the other one is i think we i think we need to do a little bit more to keep kids in school
sw04262-A_005462-005539 yes
sw04262-A_006525-006650 yeah
sw04262-A_008178-008316 um-hum
sw04262-A_008599-009040 yeah well i thi[nk]- i mean i think but overall we've got a really good system it's just
sw04262-A_009040-009108 [noise]
sw04262-A_009108-009440 we crowd a lot of kids a lot of kids in with one teacher
sw04262-A_009440-010298 and i kn[ow]- i i know i'm in a i'm i'm in college right now and um we have real small classes
sw04262-A_010298-011182 we we're very fortunate in that we do and which is good because i mean the the people that i'm in class with we all learn different ways
sw04262-A_011182-011836 and this way um i know my teacher real well and we can work on how i learn best
sw04262-A_012344-013074 well not so much a one-on-one but [vocalized-noise] you know like a ten or a fifteen on one as c[ompared]- as compared to thirty and such
sw04262-A_013419-013559 uh-huh
sw04262-A_014405-014544 um-hum
sw04262-A_014721-014858 yeah
sw04262-A_014970-015111 um-hum
sw04262-A_015384-015509 um-hum
sw04262-A_016385-016505 yes
sw04262-A_017024-017199 yeah that's true
sw04262-A_018817-018927 um-hum
sw04262-A_020393-020574 to carry it through
sw04262-A_020574-020666 yeah
sw04262-A_021375-021512 um-hum
sw04262-A_021802-021905 um-hum
sw04262-A_022968-023111 um-hum
sw04262-A_023111-023955 but still you know your basic your basic English your reading and your writing and you know and some of your math you know are very essential
sw04262-A_023955-024085 you know
sw04262-A_024293-024419 right
sw04262-A_024730-024886 no that's okay
sw04262-A_025177-025306 um-hum
sw04262-A_025568-025826 i i've run into a couple of those yeah
sw04262-A_025826-025932 yeah
sw04262-A_026049-026202 i don't know i- i think it's [vocalized-noise]
sw04262-A_026202-027007 i mean i've heard some some some school districts that have that have uh found some really unique ways about getting around the problems and
sw04262-A_027007-027177 you know of
sw04262-A_027177-028166 even though we've got a really good system the problems of you know as far com[paring]- right now they're real big into comparing our stats with that of other countries
sw04262-A_028166-028366 have you seen that
sw04262-A_028838-028964 um-hum
sw04262-A_029072-029197 um-hum
sw04262-A_029499-029808 well um i ha[ve]- i've just heard briefly about one
sw04262-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04262-B_002630-003640 oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college
sw04262-B_003640-004095 gets really out of hand i'll agree with you on that one
sw04262-B_004095-004417 uh you said two things
sw04262-B_004823-005498 uh yeah i agree with you on that i happen to think the school system's pretty good
sw04262-B_005498-006349 and that uh the problem lies in uh teaching the kids to care and you know raising them_1 up to care
sw04262-B_006349-006599 i'm not sure how to do that
sw04262-B_006599-006852 i think uh
sw04262-B_006852-007684 you know the i mean the obvious examples are kids from broken families or families where the parents really don't care but
sw04262-B_007684-008263 but i know that a lo[t]- most parents do care and you know there's still problems
sw04262-B_008263-008691 i'm not sure what the answer there is
sw04262-B_011136-011277 um-hum
sw04262-B_011899-012400 so you like a sort of a one-on-one situation with the teacher
sw04262-B_013037-013528 yeah when i when i was in high school and grade school
sw04262-B_013528-014463 i noticed the classes that i got the most out of were the ones where there were a f[ew]- at least you know a few other students who were interested
sw04262-B_014463-014777 so there'd be a lively discussion in the class
sw04262-B_014777-015809 if if no one cared you know it didn't matter if the teacher was exciting or not it'd be he'd be ta[lking]- he or she'd be talking at you
sw04262-B_015809-016044 and uh
sw04262-B_016044-016449 and if the teacher was an idiot which did happen
sw04262-B_016449-017077 if the other kids were into it you know you could have a lot of fun uh with the material anyway
sw04262-B_017206-017984 so to me uh i'm i'm gonna go back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh
sw04262-B_017984-018273 they've got to be curious
sw04262-B_018397-018879 and i think that's something that the the school system really doesn't address at all
sw04262-B_018879-019214 i mean that there's a few interesting good classes
sw04262-B_019214-019579 were uh you know a teacher will come
sw04262-B_019579-019896 and really interest a kid but most of them_1
sw04262-B_019896-020148 you know it's pretty much up to the kids
sw04262-B_020518-020927 yeah t[o]- to be interested and you know you talk t[o]-
sw04262-B_020927-021832 you talk to people on the street and they don't know history they don't know geography and it doesn't bother them they they really don't care it's not important to them
sw04262-B_021832-022259 for some reason i mean it's it's not that they're stupid because_1 they're not
sw04262-B_022259-022979 these things that i feel are important to living in the world are not important to them
sw04262-B_023920-024335 yeah and people don't know this because they don't feel that it's important
sw04262-B_024443-024828 though that's wha[t]- okay i i editorialized i'm sorry [vocalized-noise]
sw04262-B_024828-025432 i [vocalized-noise] it seems to me that they don't feel it's important and that's why they don't know English
sw04262-B_028313-029130 uh yeah we're uh falling further and further behind the cutting edge apparently
sw04262-B_029130-029513 uh what are these interesting programs you mentioned
sw04263-A_000000-000477 [noise] yeah Jim uh so uh how many children do you have and what are their ages
sw04263-A_000849-000997 uh-huh
sw04263-A_001320-001623 oh is that right wow
sw04263-A_002059-002200 i imagine
sw04263-A_002396-002911 we have uh four children but they're all grown and out of the house now
sw04263-A_002911-003413 but we still uh spend a a lot of time together really it's a it's a close family uh
sw04263-A_003413-004427 we have one daughter that's going to college uh in Boston and uh we don't see uh you know an awful lot of her every couple of weeks uh we manage to get together maybe three weeks
sw04263-A_004427-005703 and i've got uh one son that lives uh about ten miles north of us and a couple other sons that live uh about an hour away a piece th[ey]- they live in the same basically in the same area about an hour away from us
sw04263-A_005703-006707 but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh we're together with one of the you know one of the kids sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh
sw04263-A_006707-006926 couple of months
sw04263-A_006926-007417 [noise] so it's kind of a different situation are you do you have a boy and a girl two boys two girls
sw04263-A_007417-007614 two girls uh-huh
sw04263-A_007805-007952 uh-huh
sw04263-A_008245-008373 uh-huh
sw04263-A_008479-008644 [noise]
sw04263-A_009148-009272 uh-huh
sw04263-A_010201-010343 um-hum
sw04263-A_010467-010599 uh-huh
sw04263-A_011266-011400 um-hum
sw04263-A_012394-012518 um-hum
sw04263-A_013406-013695 [vocalized-noise]
sw04263-A_013831-014004 i i know what y[ou]-
sw04263-A_014146-014319 [laughter]
sw04263-A_014319-014614 no uh does your wife work or not
sw04263-A_014614-014948 okay that's good uh
sw04263-A_014948-015948 my son uh one of my sons i should say that uh had been married for nine years just had a a uh daughter uh back in July last July
sw04263-A_015948-016985 and you know they were getting pretty set in their ways after nine years and uh it was quite a readjustment for them so i imagine after uh eighteen years it really was a a a an adjustment in your lives
sw04263-A_017501-017626 um-hum
sw04263-A_018107-018240 um-hum
sw04263-A_018723-018906 um
sw04263-A_019006-019201 right
sw04263-A_019828-020020 right
sw04263-A_020020-020171 uh-huh
sw04263-A_020661-020806 uh-huh
sw04263-A_021250-021398 uh-huh
sw04263-A_021626-021837 oh is that right huh
sw04263-A_021837-021995 [laughter]
sw04263-A_022554-023743 what do what do you find is the trend amongst families in your observation for how they spend their time together what activities they're doing and how they spend the time do you think they have more or less or what
sw04263-A_024402-024532 um-hum
sw04263-A_025036-025165 um-hum
sw04263-A_025506-025639 uh-huh
sw04263-A_025768-026508 i think with s[o]- with so many parents working both husband and wife that it's difficult to find time for everybody to be together
sw04263-A_027911-028044 um-hum
sw04263-A_028783-028911 right
sw04263-A_029252-029414 uh-huh
sw04263-B_000000-000102 [noise]
sw04263-B_000416-001043 uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April
sw04263-B_001043-002442 and that's after uh twenty one years of marriage [laughter] [laughter-so] so we we've had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time in terms of spending with the kids how about yourself Frank
sw04263-B_003714-003842 um-hum
sw04263-B_005308-005449 um-hum
sw04263-B_006817-006945 um-hum
sw04263-B_007333-008342 two girls yeah yeah and [noise] my wife and i are both from Saint Louis and we've been in New Jersey now for uh eleven years
sw04263-B_008342-009208 so we've been away for a long time and when it was just the two of us we'd go back about every year but now that we have the two girls we try to get back twice a year
sw04263-B_009208-009733 because we both grew up with uh family all around us and weekend with the cousins and
sw04263-B_009733-010328 uh both of our families have uh we have siblings that have lots of children so
sw04263-B_010328-011067 we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our family's a thousand miles away
sw04263-B_011067-011335 we might even overcompensate
sw04263-B_011335-012448 we uh pretty much uh be[tween]- between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together
sw04263-B_012448-013395 married life uh before our daughters were born and uh w[e]- we pretty much i[t]- it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls
sw04263-B_013395-013628 i mean from [laughter] waking until
sw04263-B_013628-014211 uh till night time w[e]- we literally have an hour and a half to ourselves every night
sw04263-B_014211-014364 [vocalized-noise]
sw04263-B_014546-014883 no she stays at home uh and
sw04263-B_016214-016424 um-hum
sw04263-B_016624-016859 [laughter]
sw04263-B_016859-018165 it wasn't it wasn't um uh partly because we had all that time together we're ready to focus on a family s[o]- and of uh course the changing economy you know helps focus on the the home life also
sw04263-B_018165-019320 um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to
sw04263-B_019320-020088 one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home
sw04263-B_020088-020745 focus we we do have our older daughter in a preschool a Montessori and that's quite expensive and
sw04263-B_020745-021310 in fact my wife just joined the uh was just elected last night to the board of the school
sw04263-B_021310-021924 so she's spending quite a bit of time in fact she's on the other line right now doing school board talk [laughter]
sw04263-B_021924-022615 so it it seems like even our leisure time it's been focused more centered around the kids
sw04263-B_022615-022739 uh
sw04263-B_023745-024444 it seems to me uh that families are spending more fractional time together
sw04263-B_024444-025099 that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children
sw04263-B_025099-025883 um rather than and focusing more on the children's activities rather than family activities and
sw04263-B_026445-027130 yes and partly because of that working phenomena then the kids end up getting their lives scheduled with
sw04263-B_027130-027991 ballet and football and soccer i mean w[e]- we live in an area that uh soccer and football is just taking off phenomenally
sw04263-B_027991-028825 uh we we have terrible problems with scheduling soccer fields and finding enough land to even to build new football fields that they need
sw04263-B_028825-029475 and part of that phenomena is the dual working household and i think
sw04263-B_029475-029930 rather than spending the time in the evening with family activities
sw04264-A_000000-000079 [noise] um
sw04264-A_000079-000451 like i say i'm a i'm a uh a sort of an addict for
sw04264-A_000451-000962 uh current events and news so i read the paper almost everyday and
sw04264-A_000962-001084 um
sw04264-A_001084-001252 i also
sw04264-A_001252-001500 generally watch one of the national news casts
sw04264-A_002871-003516 uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news
sw04264-A_003516-004196 so i'm i'm really not very happy with local news cast and i'm uh i don't like the local p[aper]- paper very much either
sw04264-A_004196-004263 [noise]
sw04264-A_004263-004825 especially since we don't have a choice anymore since Dallas lost its one paper that i
sw04264-A_004825-005758 um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh i'm finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because_1 the selection is so bad
sw04264-A_005933-006184 no uh i used to
sw04264-A_006184-007118 uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to
sw04264-A_007118-007300 uh let it pile up
sw04264-A_007553-007687 yeah
sw04264-A_008053-008257 does it have editorial writers
sw04264-A_008427-008586 who are some of them
sw04264-A_008847-009027 can you
sw04264-A_009027-009440 um
sw04264-A_009440-010030 i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the
sw04264-A_010030-010676 best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate
sw04264-A_010998-011338 tha[t's]- that's what the Dallas Morning News does and the[y]- they
sw04264-A_011338-011502 they seem to s[elect]-
sw04264-A_011502-011853 select them kind of irregularly and i um
sw04264-A_011853-012109 i don't think they do a very good [laughter-job] [laughter-myself]
sw04264-A_012335-013445 pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news that's the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news
sw04264-A_013445-013764 but um i i'm finding that
sw04264-A_013764-013833 [noise]
sw04264-A_013833-013991 McNeal Lehrer
sw04264-A_013991-014371 uh news hour is the TV program that i
sw04264-A_014371-015420 i like to watch the most the[y]- because_1 they they don't give you these thirty seconds short shots of twenty different stories they usually spend about fifteen minutes or ten minutes on the story
sw04264-A_015420-015549 yeah
sw04264-A_015655-016160 ten o'clock well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel two at
sw04264-A_016160-016609 seven i think and it's on channel thirteen at uh ten o'clock usually
sw04264-A_016609-017033 so i try to watch that from ten to eleven u[nless]-
sw04264-A_017033-017264 unless something else is going on
sw04264-A_018204-018476 you ever listen to the public radio station
sw04264-A_018476-018648 KERA
sw04264-A_018754-018970 they're qu[ite]- yeah
sw04264-A_018970-019288 they're quite good uh yeah i like them very much
sw04264-A_019288-019642 that['s]- that's what i tune to regularly um
sw04264-A_019642-020061 KRLD if i need to know what the traffic's like
sw04264-A_020061-020191 so
sw04264-A_020976-021179 you spend a lot of time driving
sw04264-A_021289-021492 yeah [noise]
sw04264-A_021669-022272 yeah i'm always listening to the news um when i drive but i don't drive i mean i my commute is only about five minutes so i
sw04264-A_022272-022973 i don't have to uh spend a lot of time in the car if i did i guess i would rely more on the radio more than i do on the TV
sw04264-A_023137-023320 [laughter]
sw04264-A_023320-023450 [laughter] right
sw04264-A_023558-023803 right yeah
sw04264-A_023904-024055 yeah i
sw04264-A_024055-024205 i find that
sw04264-A_024205-024935 most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so that's one one reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth
sw04264-A_025221-025350 they did where
sw04264-A_025456-025584 oh
sw04264-A_025584-025949 uh-huh i know where it is yeah uh-huh
sw04264-A_026345-026512 was it a weekly

sw04265-A_000000-000326 [noise] a loaded question what do you think about gun control
sw04265-A_001272-001398 uh-huh
sw04265-A_001731-001936 well that's interesting
sw04265-A_003543-003883 that you know that's what i [laughter-suspected]
sw04265-A_003883-003997 [laughter]
sw04265-A_003997-004530 talking to a New Yorker i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control

sw04265-A_005526-005695 oh my [laughter]

sw04265-A_006685-007031 i used to do a lot of that i[t]- it can be a lot of fun
sw04265-A_007133-007370 uh yeah i think so
sw04265-A_007370-008139 i'm n[ot]- i'm i'm not sure about_1 Sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know Sears used to sell guns i just i'm aggravated with Sears right now

sw04265-A_009625-009749 yeah
sw04265-A_009898-010436 yeah well i grew up in New Mexico and you know guns were a fact of life
sw04265-A_010436-010879 uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh
sw04265-A_010879-011638 uh that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns
sw04265-A_011951-012097 i see
sw04265-A_012337-012503 yeah
sw04265-A_012626-012757 yeah
sw04265-A_012895-013366 well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that uh
sw04265-A_013366-013761 i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people
sw04265-A_013761-013921 [laughter]
sw04265-A_014116-014458 my ex-husband would choke if he [laughter-heard] [laughter-me] [laughter-say] [laughter-that]
sw04265-A_017137-017268 oh
sw04265-A_018298-018546 literally [laughter-yeah]
sw04265-A_018546-018989 [vocalized-noise] an[d]- in all those cases were those murders by guns probably
sw04265-A_020027-020226 [laughter-oh] [laughter]
sw04265-A_020351-020599 [laughter]
sw04265-A_023100-023231 right
sw04265-A_023743-023864 uh-huh
sw04265-A_024300-024444 i see
sw04265-A_024444-024681 [vocalized-noise]
sw04265-A_025390-025546 yeah
sw04265-A_027193-027316 [laughter]
sw04265-A_027498-027850 yeah [laughter] yeah i can understand that
sw04265-A_027850-028161 uh are you a member of the NRA
sw04265-A_028161-028398 are you [laughter] recently
sw04265-A_028800-028945 is that right
sw04265-A_028945-029382 my ex was a long term member of the NRA
sw04265-B_000000-000122 [noise]
sw04265-B_000122-000259 Rick
sw04265-B_000259-001344 well as a person living in one of the areas that's got both the uh one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the uh highest murder rates in the uh country
sw04265-B_001344-001784 um i happen to be an opponent of gun control
sw04265-B_001784-001911 [vocalized-noise]
sw04265-B_001911-002153 i happen to be um
sw04265-B_002153-002698 kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago
sw04265-B_002698-003235 and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um
sw04265-B_003235-003624 changes too i formerly was one of your typical New York left wingers
sw04265-B_003735-004111 [laughter] and um
sw04265-B_004443-004838 uh-huh well we're not all like that um
sw04265-B_004838-005549 about_1 a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license
sw04265-B_005549-005795 and um
sw04265-B_005795-006593 not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
sw04265-B_006593-006814 [vocalized-noise]
sw04265-B_006910-007154 all right where you are you can go to Sears right
sw04265-B_007312-007473 really yeah
sw04265-B_007858-008534 yeah yeah you know the s[tores]- the stores are here but it's you know you walk in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork
sw04265-B_008534-008679 [vocalized-noise]
sw04265-B_008679-009531 uh it's kind of funny because_1 um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
sw04265-B_009531-009965 but uh ye[ah]- i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before
sw04265-B_009965-010232 ah
sw04265-B_010370-010508 um-hum
sw04265-B_011121-011308 yeah
sw04265-B_011554-012028 uh for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it
sw04265-B_012028-012432 um and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
sw04265-B_012432-012630 uh they've been getting a lot of bad press
sw04265-B_012630-012778 um
sw04265-B_012778-012927 it's uh
sw04265-B_013675-013801 sounds fair
sw04265-B_013801-014025 [laughter]
sw04265-B_014025-014182 [laughter] um
sw04265-B_014299-014970 uh-huh well you know it um you know it's kind of interesting you say that because_1 we had a series about a year and a half ago
sw04265-B_014970-015503 of murders here four within the space of about two months
sw04265-B_015503-015812 and the profile of all of them was
sw04265-B_015812-016327 a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex-wife
sw04265-B_016327-017233 um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman
sw04265-B_017233-017751 and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um
sw04265-B_017751-018476 you know there are you know tha[t]- maybe just maybe she could've uh had a better shot at it if um she'd been armed
sw04265-B_018476-018666 you know at uh
sw04265-B_018921-019567 um i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but um
sw04265-B_019567-019852 you know it uh  what was that 
sw04265-B_019852-020086 oh my wife is screaming shotgun
sw04265-B_020086-020439 [laughter] either go get it or uh [laughter]
sw04265-B_020439-020661 [laughter] or what um
sw04265-B_020661-020936 what do you call we had uh
sw04265-B_020936-021180 [vocalized-noise] friend of mine who would
sw04265-B_021180-021447 maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
sw04265-B_021447-021810 uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime
sw04265-B_021810-022365 and uh you know that's something we all actually [vocalized-noise] except that is the purpose of the police and i said what do you mean by that
sw04265-B_022365-022542 and his comment was
sw04265-B_022542-023358 well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
sw04265-B_023358-023977 they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it
sw04265-B_023977-024337 so if the police aren't going to prevent it who is
sw04265-B_024538-025114 and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it
sw04265-B_025114-025468 you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
sw04265-B_025468-026117 you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was sc[reaming]- his his car had been stolen
sw04265-B_026117-027198 and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they'd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter
sw04265-B_027302-027535 you know [vocalized-noise] a matter of priorities i guess
sw04265-B_027638-027815 yeah but um
sw04265-B_027815-027966 [vocalized-noise]
sw04265-B_028077-028206 as a matter of fact
sw04265-B_028206-028331 [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04265-B_028331-028875 card carrying [laughter-um] it's about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time
sw04265-B_028875-029069 and um
sw04265-B_029248-029698 yeah yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that um
sw04265-B_029698-029831 yeah i- i don't know
sw04266-A_000000-000114 [noise] Jonathan um
sw04266-A_000114-000619 it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out
sw04266-A_000619-001850 particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that
sw04266-A_005779-006066 do you think it's possible
sw04266-A_008514-008639 um-hum
sw04266-A_011431-012026 i got uh my office mate um he he got divorced and and uh
sw04266-A_012026-013101 he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like
sw04266-A_013101-014265 a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out um ice skating and water skiing and and i mean just if there was something that that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it
sw04266-A_014265-015154 and now now that he's he's no longer the the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids
sw04266-A_015154-016030 which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that
sw04266-A_016030-016532 but but i think i think he did the right thing is is making sure that the kids really
sw04266-A_016532-017670 i mean they might get mad as heck at at at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that that there's no one that loves them_1 as much as uh as dad and mom
sw04266-A_017670-017826 you know
sw04266-A_019109-019237 yeah
sw04266-A_020190-020647 i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad
sw04266-A_020647-021895 now and and it's really it's really way too late i- i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to to try let his sons know that that he loves them and it's
sw04266-A_021895-022106 i mean to some extent it's too late
sw04266-A_022106-022324 my dad i'm sorry go ahead
sw04266-A_022439-022627 yeah my dad um
sw04266-A_022627-023157 i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until uh
sw04266-A_023157-023592 oh i don't know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it
sw04266-A_023592-024103 but uh i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it
sw04266-A_024103-025032 but i think i- i mean granted it's easy to [laughter-say] i don't have kids but uh i- i- i think that's one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is is say it
sw04266-A_025032-025813 as many times as as just so that they get oh you know come on dad stop that but you know i mean you know i don't know
sw04266-A_027008-027194 [laughter]
sw04266-A_027350-027479 uh-huh
sw04266-A_027858-028211 um what kind of stuff do you do with them
sw04266-A_029820-029971 [laughter]
sw04266-B_000000-000103 [noise]
sw04266-B_001559-001780 um-hum
sw04266-B_001780-001921 uh
sw04266-B_001921-002591 yeah that's an interesting point i work in uh the computer business which tends to be pretty
sw04266-B_002591-004280 high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and it's interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases they're still trying to put in the hours but they're also trying to spend a lot of time at home
sw04266-B_004280-005215 and in many cases they've got spouses who work so it's it's an interesting juggling pattern i
sw04266-B_005215-005950 my impression is that people try to uh to do both if they can as tough as that is
sw04266-B_006068-006679 uh boy that's a good question i've my kids are eight and a half and
sw04266-B_006679-007980 six now and i've been working in this business you know while they were growing up and you know it's [noise] it's tough uh there have been plenty of times where i've had to
sw04266-B_007980-008589 work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to
sw04266-B_008589-009652 but i i do sense that people's expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parent's generation where
sw04266-B_009652-009957 you know child raising was kind of seen as the
sw04266-B_009957-010673 the woman's responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know that's just the way it was i think
sw04266-B_010673-011588 today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can
sw04266-B_014187-014325 uh-huh
sw04266-B_014704-014829 uh-huh
sw04266-B_015947-016145 sure
sw04266-B_017704-018298 yeah i think there's a lot to that you you really have to establish relationship early on
sw04266-B_018298-019136 yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father
sw04266-B_019136-019491 and i you know it's it's hard to say i don't
sw04266-B_019491-020270 travel in a wide social circle but it's my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are are trying to change uh anyway
sw04266-B_021315-021452 um
sw04266-B_022108-022259 yeah
sw04266-B_022259-022467 yeah i was just saying yeah
sw04266-B_022782-022915 um
sw04266-B_024368-024499 [laughter]
sw04266-B_025454-025605 [laughter]
sw04266-B_025747-026560 yeah actually i've heard a lot of that from uh my son who you know goes through periods were he's particularly
sw04266-B_026560-027079 attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you
sw04266-B_027079-028059 things like that not just kidding around not really meaning it but you know not as comfortable with uh an overt display of affection from me anyway [vocalized-noise]
sw04266-B_028059-029971 uh try to uh plan outings to museum say take them_1 to playgrounds you know baseball in the back yard that kind of thing a lot of times following his lead he's currently obsessed with Legos i mean he he
sw04267-A_000000-000609 [noise] all right so what do you think about gun control or wh[at]- how do you rate on a one to ten scale your feelings about gun control
sw04267-A_001754-001935 um-hum
sw04267-A_003502-003970 i'd probably be closer to uh on the one side [laughter]
sw04267-A_003970-005003 [laughter-i] don't really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets pro[duced]- you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house
sw04267-A_005003-005273 that's about the only good that ever comes from it
sw04267-A_005400-006058 well i yeah you could i mean but do they necessarily have to keep them_1 at home to do that
sw04267-A_006058-007079 i mean maybe there's a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i don't know but i don't know if individual ownership is necessary
sw04267-A_007079-007425 [noise]
sw04267-A_007425-007572 um-hum
sw04267-A_008500-008653 right
sw04267-A_008653-008793 but
sw04267-A_009050-009178 [laughter]
sw04267-A_009178-009393 that's true
sw04267-A_009393-009655 right that's true
sw04267-A_009655-010551 yeah mostly i guess handguns a[re]- are create the problems but a lot of people would come back and say well uh you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but
sw04267-A_010653-011430 once again i think i[t]- it may be better to keep the guns uh there and l[et]- they can go there and and use them_1 if that's all they need it for
sw04267-A_012272-012398 sure
sw04267-A_013102-013257 yes
sw04267-A_013479-013612 um-hum
sw04267-A_013612-013754 right
sw04267-A_013934-014077 um-hum
sw04267-A_014540-015225 well they can always be tweaked around and made deadly once again [vocalized-noise]
sw04267-A_015989-016123 right
sw04267-A_016768-017671 yeah i do[n't]- i don't openly i don't i think any gu[n]- any gun can be modified to to ce[rtain]- a certain extent to be used as a weapon
sw04267-A_017671-018164 so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available but
sw04267-A_018353-018490 right
sw04267-A_018942-019087 right
sw04267-A_019859-019989 um-hum
sw04267-A_020788-020937 right
sw04267-A_021672-021840 yeah
sw04267-A_021840-022059 that's right
sw04267-A_022509-022664 exactly
sw04267-A_022994-023678 right that's yeah for example what happened just the other evening uh Evander Holyfield's brother [laughter]
sw04267-A_023678-024220 uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead
sw04267-A_025402-025560 um-hum
sw04267-A_026350-026749 sure sure but i guess uh
sw04267-A_026749-028178 if you look at the NRA's position on it they tend to say that they don't want they really don't want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and it's start[s]- it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i don't really respect that position
sw04267-A_028178-028593 and i think they're kind of getting out of touch with reality in some of their stances
sw04267-A_029664-029802 um-hum
sw04267-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04267-B_000544-000991 well i guess i'd probably put myself on about a five i'm kind of in the middle on that
sw04267-B_000991-001883 i think that there's uh there are some guns that i just can't think of any reason why anybody would want to have them_1 unless they just want to go shoot somebody
sw04267-B_001883-002680 but on the other hand i think there's a lot of legitimate use for guns too and i don't see any reason why we should do any sort of control or uh
sw04267-B_002680-003570 certainly no sort of you know serious restrictions on those for example hunting and things like that and even some self-defense things so how do you feel about it
sw04267-B_003884-004021 okay
sw04267-B_004928-005049 um-hum
sw04267-B_005201-005603 i don't know i know some people who hunt and uh you know
sw04267-B_005994-006152 uh
sw04267-B_006630-006770 um-hum
sw04267-B_007013-007480 yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them_1 get hurt from handguns
sw04267-B_007480-008304 and so i look at somebody like you know who's got a you know maybe a a twenty two caliber rifle or something like that if you know good for
sw04267-B_008304-009566 for you know maybe hunting some small you know animal or something like that you know i ne[ver]- i never hear a reports of people you know shooting each other with things like that unless they're out in the woods and drunk and then of course that's a that's [laughter-another] problem
sw04267-B_009566-009692 but
sw04267-B_010473-010601 um-hum
sw04267-B_011041-011200 yeah
sw04267-B_011200-011358 um-hum
sw04267-B_011358-012597 yeah i agree that there's a real problem with uh with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and and things like that i mean they uh
sw04267-B_012597-014006 i think we both agree that there's there's no uh at least use that i legitimate use that i can think of for a semiautomatic rifle except to kill people i mean that's what they were designed for and that's what they're good for
sw04267-B_014006-014613 now you know i suppose if if there was some way that we could render them unusable
sw04267-B_014613-014735 the[n]-
sw04267-B_014735-014865 yeah
sw04267-B_015009-016060 yeah i guess if there were some absolute definite way that you could you could make something like that unusable then i [vocalized-noise] then i probably wouldn't have a problem with a collector having one
sw04267-B_016060-016857 but i don't know how to do that uh without you know even pouring cement down the barrels probably way to get around that
sw04267-B_017263-017395 yeah
sw04267-B_017593-017730 um-hum
sw04267-B_018022-018414 yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available
sw04267-B_018414-019033 but at that point you know i guess i don't realistically think there's anything you can do about that
sw04267-B_019033-019577 you know y[ou]- you can certainly make the possession o[f]- of of of such weapons you know
sw04267-B_019577-019922 you know the penalties for that very very very strict
sw04267-B_019922-020861 but i- i guess i feel like you know just like anything else you know you know there's lots of illegal things out there that people that people a[re]- you know still getting
sw04267-B_020861-021706 but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns don't kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong
sw04267-B_021706-022330 i think i think [laughter-guns] [laughter-do] kill people and that you know you know let's face it i mean if you got a gun
sw04267-B_022330-023163 it's so much easier in the heat of an argument or something to to hurt somebody than it is with a knife or [vocalized-noise]
sw04267-B_023607-023757 um-hum
sw04267-B_024185-024325 that's right
sw04267-B_024325-025459 that's right but you know it's interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people
sw04267-B_025459-026559 so you know i[t]- i[t]- it goes to sh[ow]- i[t]- it does prove that even even you know g[un]- gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills
sw04267-B_027307-027438 yeah
sw04267-B_027901-028023 um-hum
sw04267-B_028180-028309 no i
sw04267-B_028494-028948 i think that's an extremist position and i and i don't really subscribe to it either
sw04267-B_028948-029341 i think on the you know like i said i think there are some legitimate
sw04267-B_029341-029802 you know uses for guns and that's why i kind of put myself at a five but
sw04268-A_000000-000414 [noise] well i have a a couple of of of small children
sw04268-A_000414-000741 one is four uh the other one's an infant
sw04268-A_000741-001443 and when we were looking for care for the older child when he was about nine weeks or so
sw04268-A_001443-002476 i uh i- i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very uh low ratio of of children to to care giver
sw04268-A_002476-003056 so that the so that my infant could could really receive a lot of attention
sw04268-A_003056-003187 and
sw04268-A_003187-004016 for that first couple of of years i was able to find that in in a family setting
sw04268-A_004016-004540 uh [vocalized-noise] uh a a day care provider offering services out of her own home
sw04268-A_004540-005651 but her cir[cumstances]- circumstances changed and she lost the the help that she had uh so that they were really now quite a number of of demands on her time
sw04268-A_005651-006249 and we switched over to to a uh a commercial day care service
sw04268-A_006249-007269 which actually is the best of of both worlds it's it's not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so i[t]-
sw04268-A_007269-007981 the the youngest one [laughter-now] the the the new infant still receives personalized care
sw04268-A_007981-008658 uh but at the same school his his older brother is receiving uh basically pre kindergarten
sw04268-A_008658-008805 care
sw04268-A_016833-017651 i i i know i i've had the problem myself where the child might might begin to run a a low grade fever
sw04268-A_017651-018800 and the school calls up and says come get your come get your child uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not
sw04268-A_018800-020165 it's really true uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year if you're back to work and
sw04268-A_020165-020909 you know how frequently that you have to go to the doctor for the little ones just for checkups alone in the first year
sw04268-A_020909-021282 uh sometimes your boss doesn't think that that's
sw04268-A_021282-021488 really terrific [laughter]
sw04268-A_021488-022590 but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses
sw04268-A_022590-022969 and the school doesn't want to want to keep your child
sw04268-A_022969-024002 we do have up here um and some of the hospitals do this as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children
sw04268-A_024002-024363 out of their hospital facilities but
sw04268-A_024363-024893 that i[t]- and it's it's an interesting way to approach it but there's a problem
sw04268-A_024893-025471 i don't know how many parents would be willing to take their children
sw04268-A_025471-025797 to a a a location a child has never seen
sw04268-A_028562-028753 and but yeah
sw04268-A_029622-029930 i i know we we would've liked to
sw04268-B_000000-000112 [noise]
sw04268-B_007551-007645 [noise]
sw04268-B_008797-009238 my situation is a little bit different but it still covers the same type of problem
sw04268-B_009238-010010 i am a grandmother but i'm also employed but my grandson and his father moved back in and lived with us for about a year
sw04268-B_010010-010281 and so and he was about four
sw04268-B_010281-010892 so it was sort of like another generation raising a a a child and we're all working adults
sw04268-B_010892-011865 so it i have some of the same problems it's no longer a problem now that he is older and in school but this has been a problem no matter what generation you're in
sw04268-B_011865-012814 and one of the things that and then also in the setting where i work i see a lot of uh young people especially uh young women with children
sw04268-B_012814-013439 who have to take time off because of problems with the babysitting or child care services
sw04268-B_013439-014278 and i think uh one of the things that and also when i had the grand[son]- my grandson here that we were keeping care of him
sw04268-B_014278-015049 one of the main problems that affects work and affects the care too is when you're as any when the child is the least bit sick
sw04268-B_015049-015868 uh uh the you have to come get them there's a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service
sw04268-B_015868-016801 where there is uh at the same place where they're care for as a well child they have facilities for uh sick care
sw04268-B_017895-018066 come get him
sw04268-B_018066-018218 yeah
sw04268-B_021410-021569 no
sw04268-B_024193-024423 well that's an interesting yeah
sw04268-B_025806-026254 oh that's that's another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services
sw04268-B_026254-027024 the facility that i work with is a large facility and they're looking at day care now and i would love to see day care on site
sw04268-B_027024-027368 where if you have lunch you can go over and spend it with a child
sw04268-B_027368-027906 uh if you ha[ve]- and i would like a twenty four hour day care and it's big enough where it could do that
sw04268-B_027906-028378 where if you worked different shifts uh you could uh uh
sw04268-B_028378-028570 bring the child in
sw04268-B_028570-029650 for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime
sw04269-A_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04269-A_000032-000296 so we're supposed to talk about computers
sw04269-A_000296-000533 and you ow[n]- and you own one
sw04269-A_000641-000905 course [laughter]
sw04269-A_001092-001254 a[ll]- right
sw04269-A_001254-001404 uh-huh
sw04269-A_001741-002353 so do you do you happen to work for some uh computer company up there in [vocalized-noise]
sw04269-A_002353-002517 [vocalized-noise]
sw04269-A_002681-002983 yeah that's why you have a computer at home
sw04269-A_004359-004648 uh-huh does it make a lot easier
sw04269-A_004894-005049 [laughter]
sw04269-A_005297-005433 uh-huh
sw04269-A_008964-009095 uh-huh
sw04269-A_009607-010210 well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually
sw04269-A_010210-011357 and to human factors and i uh i you know i was into when i was in college i had a Commodore sixty four went to college
sw04269-A_011357-012311 uh oh at at work they had IBM PCs and compatibles and i worked for them f[or]- with them for a y[ear]- few years but i didn't have a need to ha[ve]- have one at home
sw04269-A_012311-013489 because of as a poor graduate student i didn't have money and also because uh there're plenty of them_1 around at work but then came the Macintosh
sw04269-A_013489-014445 and it they came out with the Mac 2 which is a whole lot more useful than any other Macintosh tha[t]- that had come out and they also came out with Hypercard
sw04269-A_014445-014909 and i needed to use that for my dissertation work
sw04269-A_015082-016509 yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i bought my own and that's where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh
sw04269-A_016509-016827 well uh replacement ones
sw04269-A_016827-017643 yeah oh no no no no i've had this SE thirty for f[or]- number of years now couple years at least
sw04269-A_017643-017814 three years almost now
sw04269-A_017814-017940 uh
sw04269-A_017940-018063 s[o]-
sw04269-A_019971-020101 uh-huh

sw04269-A_025487-025658 um-hum
sw04269-A_025758-026709 well as you know ge[tting]- we're getting away from that but that's why you have one at home because it was cost effective and you got your work done basically um
sw04269-A_026709-027992 it helped me get my work done because uh it's you know i'm i'm into human computer interaction and human and computer interfaces it was one of the better ones and so
sw04269-A_028428-028557 yeah
sw04269-B_000006-000144 hi uh
sw04269-B_000245-000377 that's it
sw04269-B_000478-000691 sure i do don't you
sw04269-B_000833-001158 uh okay uh i've got a PC
sw04269-B_001158-001333 do you have a Mac
sw04269-B_001333-001875 [laughter] okay
sw04269-B_002318-002874 no uh ac[tually]- well yeah i do i i work for Lockheed and uh
sw04269-B_002975-003926 no actually i it's like i i have a com[puter]- i s[chool]- when i went to grad school i uh i realized that having a computer would be
sw04269-B_003926-004403 li[ke]- tha[t]- it was going to make my life a lot easier
sw04269-B_004403-004574 so
sw04269-B_004574-005363 sure did uh i mean i you you i don't think i don't know anybody that can get through school without a computer at this point in time
sw04269-B_005363-005671 especially like um
sw04269-B_005671-006233 it well just for like produ[cing]- for like for producing papers and things like that
sw04269-B_006233-006856 um it it was you know it it was like indispensable n[obody]- nobody on the typewriter anymore
sw04269-B_006856-007774 yeah it's a sort of thing where with the kind of support you can get from software to for for writing things like that
sw04269-B_007774-008106 uh i wri[ting]- [vocalized-noise] using a u[sing]-
sw04269-B_008106-009017 using a typewriter was sort of like you know uh lighting a fire by like rubbing two sticks together you know instead of using your Bic lighter
sw04269-B_009017-009555 yeah why'd you choose uh have you always had a Mac or why'd you choose a Mac
sw04269-B_011111-011250 uh-huh
sw04269-B_012642-012768 [laughter]
sw04269-B_013063-013195 uh-huh
sw04269-B_014407-014541 uh-huh
sw04269-B_014854-015166 oh rea[lly]- you did your dissertation with Hypercard
sw04269-B_016632-016961 you're going to tell me you have a Quadra right now right
sw04269-B_016961-017205 [laughter] [noise]
sw04269-B_017539-017680 uh-huh
sw04269-B_017824-018521 i i[t]- you know it's like wh[en]- when i when i decided to like buy a buy a computer
sw04269-B_018521-019025 i one of the things that like that i i came down to is is that
sw04269-B_019025-020117 i i chose my computer on basis of uh of i- i don't know i guess at work we would call it like you know MIPS per dollar or something like that
sw04269-B_020117-020247 and it turned
sw04269-B_020247-020662 i i did a careful ana[lysis]- i went for my MBA
sw04269-B_020662-020727 [laughter]
sw04269-B_020727-021592 anyway i did a careful analysis of of li[ke]- o[f]- of the of what i could get for how much i was going to spend
sw04269-B_021592-021714 and
sw04269-B_021714-022572 it's like it turned out that that that Macs were almost twice as expensive like per feature than PCs were
sw04269-B_022572-023006 and that was like why that was why i cho[se]- i i ended up cho[se]- ch[ose]-
sw04269-B_023006-023514 even though it's like i evaluated Macs as being the superior
sw04269-B_023514-023924 uh qualitatively better
sw04269-B_023924-024444 in terms of like you know uh what what they could do and like ease of use and things like that
sw04269-B_024444-025637 when i started like uh investigating the cost of software that's when i decided that a PC was like re[ally]- was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product
sw04269-B_025637-025774 uh
sw04269-B_026500-026634 um-hum
sw04269-B_027514-027646 um-hum
sw04269-B_027863-028486 yeah no i i i i agree it it is it i[s]- i[t]- i[s]- is superior in tha[t]- in that case
sw04269-B_028486-028612 but
sw04269-B_028612-029533 i you know one of the things that i- i i think about in terms of o[f]- of like of computers is um
sw04269-B_029533-029849 i[t]- i[t]-
sw04269-B_029849-030048 i think that [noise] i don't know i[t]-
sw04270-A_000002-000393 okay_1 i guess probably the first thing uh we could start off with is
sw04270-A_000393-000699 [noise] uh if you've ever been on a jury before or not
sw04270-A_001035-001170 uh-huh
sw04270-A_001280-001450 [noise]
sw04270-A_001741-001881 um-hum
sw04270-A_001982-002127 uh
sw04270-A_002331-002484 right
sw04270-A_002484-003877 i uh just recently retired from the army and and so when we uh moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and uh it was an interesting experience i'd never done it before and
sw04270-A_003877-003993 [laughter]
sw04270-A_004095-004369 this was uh all civil
sw04270-A_004369-005156 although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people
sw04270-A_005156-005366 [noise] before they could actually
sw04270-A_005366-006203 uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think
sw04270-A_006203-006802 but the i guess the question that is uh what we think of uh trial by jury [laughter]
sw04270-A_006802-006924 that's a hard question
sw04270-A_006924-007156 [noise]
sw04270-A_007721-007925 right um-hum
sw04270-A_008535-008667 right
sw04270-A_008867-009013 um-hum
sw04270-A_009494-009658 y[eah]-
sw04270-A_009658-009958 right and it meant um-hum
sw04270-A_010554-010698 right
sw04270-A_010871-011219 course you're uh as a juror to you're
sw04270-A_011219-011528 you're really at the mercy of the uh the lawyers
sw04270-A_011528-011780 because you don't know what really went on
sw04270-A_011780-012074 and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth
sw04270-A_012074-012578 and uh you're kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are uh
sw04270-A_012578-012941 examining and cross examining the witnesses and they're
sw04270-A_012941-014086 so it's it's really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual
sw04270-A_014086-014386 and when you got right down to it
sw04270-A_014386-014933 uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't
sw04270-A_014933-015942 you can't you can't go by what the the lawyer is uh is saying pretty much and you don't know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth
sw04270-A_015942-016634 it's a very difficult decision i found uh [noise] one of the things that bothered me was the in one case the
sw04270-A_016634-017231 the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults you'd think they could have worked their problems out
sw04270-A_017231-017407 but instead [laughter]
sw04270-A_017407-017976 we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don't you people just
sw04270-A_017976-019053 you're supposed to be adults why don't you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time
sw04270-A_019238-019328 [noise]
sw04270-A_019446-019590 right
sw04270-A_019691-020280 it's an awful responsibility but it's like voting and all the other things that we're responsible for it's
sw04270-A_020280-020603 one of those things you have to do i guess
sw04270-A_021288-021438 right
sw04270-A_021775-021911 uh-huh
sw04270-A_022406-022540 right
sw04270-A_022540-022626 [noise]
sw04270-A_022819-022962 um-hum
sw04270-A_023242-023381 [laughter]
sw04270-A_023381-023560 yeah that was a lot of money
sw04270-A_024299-024440 um-hum
sw04270-A_024713-024808 [laughter]
sw04270-A_024879-025025 right
sw04270-A_025149-025469 well yeah what the value would be equal to today
sw04270-A_025469-025599 yeah
sw04270-A_025599-025711 [noise]
sw04270-A_026510-026708 um-hum yeah
sw04270-A_027693-027827 right
sw04270-A_028019-028142 uh
sw04270-A_028294-028442 uh-huh
sw04270-A_028553-028680 hm
sw04270-A_028781-028923 um-hum
sw04270-A_028930-029113 the uh
sw04270-A_029147-029307 right
sw04270-A_029407-029679 first one that i had was a drug case
sw04270-A_029679-029895 [noise] and then the second one was a
sw04270-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04270-B_000729-001804 oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact um i was selected for jury at one time but uh fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective
sw04270-B_001804-002402 i had already changed juris[diction]- jurisdictions uh and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it
sw04270-B_003863-004150 w[ell]- was it civil or or criminal
sw04270-B_006938-007851 yeah well o[n]- on the one hand there's a lot of uh o[f]- of of positive things you're not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a preju[dice]-
sw04270-B_007851-008099 on the other hand um
sw04270-B_008099-008232 well
sw04270-B_008232-008929 juries are not legally experti[se]- experts and and they often just feel bad for somebody
sw04270-B_008929-009538 but which is right they should often uh especially for example in a a civil case
sw04270-B_009538-010875 they'll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account uh any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view
sw04270-B_015892-016013 right
sw04270-B_019115-019521 yeah well it's hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings
sw04270-B_019521-019815 so i[t]- it uh it ge[ts]-
sw04270-B_020103-020362 uh all the civic duty yeah
sw04270-B_020524-021344 well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they wa[nt]- more focus on criminals
sw04270-B_021344-021845 but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights
sw04270-B_021845-022892 we have it written that uh even for civil cases everyone's guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the uh dispute is for more than twenty five dollars
sw04270-B_022892-023536 now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the Bill of Rights was a lot different than what it is now
sw04270-B_023536-023719 and uh
sw04270-B_023719-024763 basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know
sw04270-B_024887-025397 ten thousand dollars i- i'm not exactly sure the uh the economics involved a[nd]-
sw04270-B_025397-025733 that's right and uh it makes it very uh
sw04270-B_025833-026605 oh most cases i[n]- s[mall]- most small cases for uh civil suits really shouldn't h[ave]- even have the option of a jury
sw04270-B_026605-027242 uh i know we i was involved uh in a suit uh where the uh
sw04270-B_027345-028067 you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and and wanted kn[ow]- you know i don't know five or ten thousand dollars
sw04270-B_028169-028378 and they requested a trial by jury
sw04270-B_028378-029409 and it seemed like really stupid that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved
sw04271-A_000000-000572 [noise] i'll start in the first place i don't have a family and i don't have a budget [laughter]
sw04271-A_000572-000699 and
sw04271-A_000911-001072 it's called what
sw04271-A_001227-002508 yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we weren't really destitute but
sw04271-A_002508-003032 we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money
sw04271-A_003032-003177 and so now
sw04271-A_003177-003786 i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget
sw04271-A_004983-005106 uh-huh
sw04271-A_006905-007446 so you don't keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your inco[me]- what you income is and stuff
sw04271-A_008583-008795 oh so you do keep track of it
sw04271-A_009755-010028 do you actually balance it at the end of the month
sw04271-A_010028-010193 oh
sw04271-A_011071-011746 well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since i've had a check[book]- and i'm i'm thirty two now so
sw04271-A_011746-012590 for i guess fourteen or fifteen years i've had a checking account but i've never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there
sw04271-A_012590-012969 if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check i'd transfer five hundred dollars in
sw04271-A_012969-013565 and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking
sw04271-A_013565-013858 you know i should really do that [laughter]
sw04271-A_013858-014202 and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC
sw04271-A_014202-014868 and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so it'd keep the balance for me
sw04271-A_015340-015464 uh-huh
sw04271-A_016138-016339 so that comes second nature to you
sw04271-A_016339-016607 yeah my i still haven't balanced
sw04271-A_016607-017300 i figure if i keep do[ing]- keep this up long enough eventually someday it'll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced
sw04271-A_020565-020881 yeah well you spend more time on it than i do that's for sure
sw04271-A_021317-021741 does your balance ma[tch]- balance match the banks at the at the end of the month
sw04271-A_022662-022785 uh-huh
sw04271-A_022931-023053 [laughter]
sw04271-A_023161-023654 oh i don't get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this
sw04271-A_024004-024128 eighteen
sw04271-A_024128-024431 oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge
sw04271-A_025093-025222 uh-huh
sw04271-A_026260-026388 right
sw04271-A_028212-028687 yeah you like to live on the edge i see [laughter]
sw04271-A_029711-029863 uh-huh
sw04271-B_000000-000038 [noise]
sw04271-B_000038-000173 okay
sw04271-B_000278-000400 i don't either
sw04271-B_000400-000970 [laughter] neither do i [laughter] it's called scraping together [laughter]
sw04271-B_000970-001347 [laughter] scraping together [laughter]
sw04271-B_003816-003980 well i
sw04271-B_003980-004177 i
sw04271-B_004177-004349 my family was [vocalized-noise]
sw04271-B_004349-005248 they were okay because_1 i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably i'd say but
sw04271-B_005248-006628 um i pretty well i- i get pai[d]- i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of learn to to set aside a certain amount of money i[t]- you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other ki[nd]- you know
sw04271-B_006628-006981 expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it [laughter]
sw04271-B_007406-008256 uh well i know what my income is but uh uh my but as far as keeping records i- i i have a a ledger that w[ill]- uh uh
sw04271-B_008256-008610 how much i owe people whatever and i deduct it out of that
sw04271-B_008713-008997 yeah i- i- i kee[p]- i i keep track of it
sw04271-B_008997-009827 uh i'm not exactly accurate of it every month i mean [laughter] but you know i keep up with it like once every other month or so get it caught up
sw04271-B_009946-010094 uh yeah
sw04271-B_010094-011113 i'm not real good about uh keeping track in checks and stuff like that but uh uh i always keep track o[f]- of the ledger who i pay and when and whatever and what the balance is
sw04271-B_012947-013083 yeah
sw04271-B_014672-015369 well i work with uh i'm work with an an accounting uh section of Department of Corrections
sw04271-B_015369-016129 in in North Carolina for the state so i i work with Lotus and DataEase a lot so i i'm real familiar with that
sw04271-B_016252-016379 yeah
sw04271-B_017271-017680 well i bank with Wachavia and they have this [vocalized-noise]
sw04271-B_017680-018359 system of of where you can call a number you can call and get all your checks and what your balance is and
sw04271-B_018359-019517 and what checks is cleared that month or whatever and i do that like maybe twice a month i check to see wh[at]- you know what checks i've written and always write paid on it when it's paid so i get an idea
sw04271-B_019517-020626 you know subtract what [laughter] what what i have in you know in the in my account and what i've i've written checks for that haven't been cleared or whatever so i keep up with it that way too
sw04271-B_020825-021446 uh i wouldn't say that i just you know i just i just don't want to write bad [laughter-checks]
sw04271-B_021719-022715 um for the most part yeah i i i've got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me
sw04271-B_022715-023308 and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever so i say okay and i get it to her
sw04271-B_023555-024074 oh i wish i wish mine'd only charge me ten dollars or here they charge eighteen
sw04271-B_024074-024213 yeah
sw04271-B_024387-025299 well not not all the time it's it's like uh this time i- i i filed electronically my taxes and uh
sw04271-B_025299-025672 i didn't have quite enough for my mortgage payment and um
sw04271-B_025672-026778 i told her and i said i'm waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage pay[ment]- you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but
sw04271-B_026778-027757 and i[t]- it didn't the mortgage check hit before but she told me that if it did not to worry about it that she would just uh sh[e]- she wouldn't charge me she since i let her know a head of time that
sw04271-B_027757-028267 i was waiting on that and whatever so but th[e]- the mortgage payment was due so
sw04271-B_028267-028414 [laughter]
sw04271-B_028414-028672 well sometimes yeah [laughter]
sw04271-B_028672-029353 uh uh i believe in that philosophy o[f]- of praying that it don't hit the bank before the check does or [laughter-deposit] [laughter-does]
sw04271-B_029353-029863 if i want something bad enough i i'll do it but normally i don't do that but in case it's something that's [vocalized-noise]

sw04272-A_000672-001017 well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody
sw04272-A_001017-001135 [laughter]
sw04272-A_001135-001407 oh i don't know quite a while i was about to go to sleep

sw04272-A_001556-001693 well you ready
sw04272-A_001693-001953 okay you ready okay
sw04272-A_001953-002030 [noise]
sw04272-A_002030-002342 okay well um [noise]
sw04272-A_002342-002569 provocative topic as usually
sw04272-A_002677-002806 yeah
sw04272-A_003146-003451 yeah i uh well [vocalized-noise]
sw04272-A_003451-003659 i'm kind of um [noise]
sw04272-A_003659-004083 waffling i don't know i i uh i don't really like the idea
sw04272-A_004083-004754 but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're going to have public capital punishment then
sw04272-A_004754-005231 you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh
sw04272-A_005231-005796 finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison
sw04272-A_005796-006213 sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him
sw04272-A_006213-006861 and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely can't reverse
sw04272-A_008557-008689 um-hum
sw04272-A_011668-011818 um-hum
sw04272-A_011918-012067 yeah i uh
sw04272-A_012067-012973 course usually the case where there's a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway
sw04272-A_013105-013216 [laughter]
sw04272-A_013317-013438 yeah
sw04272-A_013905-014027 yeah
sw04272-A_015294-015521 well but um
sw04272-A_015521-015958 if uh if you don't execute sick people
sw04272-A_016059-016204 um
sw04272-A_016204-016475 for acting out their sickness
sw04272-A_016677-017300 uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that
sw04272-A_017300-017540 i mean since they're obviously insane
sw04272-A_017718-018350 course i guess there's a definition of insanity of whether the[y]- or not they knew what they were doing that's a little different than what i'm talking about
sw04272-A_019592-019723 um-hum
sw04272-A_022592-022764 yeah but uh i[t]- i[t]-
sw04272-A_022865-023093 there's a case where the guy's obviously ill
sw04272-A_023093-023623 i mean a guy that opens up people's brains and performs lobotomies
sw04272-A_023623-024036 amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational
sw04272-A_024181-024612 i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state
sw04272-A_024612-025119 to end that guy's life i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life
sw04272-A_025119-025407 if [laughter] if he's that [laughter-irrational]
sw04272-A_027101-028091 well yeah i don't know that there's any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did
sw04272-B_000000-000008 [noise]
sw04272-B_000008-000131 hello
sw04272-B_000270-000567 hello Tad this is Glenn in Portsmouth New Hampshire
sw04272-B_000685-000820 uh
sw04272-B_000921-001035 [laughter]
sw04272-B_001035-001215 how long were you hanging around for
sw04272-B_001570-001794 well i'm glad you hung in there
sw04272-B_001794-001944 sure
sw04272-B_002484-002689 oh capital punishment definitely
sw04272-B_002689-002941 most people have very strong opinions about it
sw04272-B_002941-003133 usually on both extremes though
sw04272-B_003308-003458 what about yourself
sw04272-B_006088-006355 um-hum we[ll]-
sw04272-B_006849-007308 well i think there's got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that
sw04272-B_007308-007743 you can not execute anyone that there's not absolute positive identification
sw04272-B_007743-007881 and
sw04272-B_007881-008051 a lot of crimes you
sw04272-B_008051-008604 uh that a a person is convicted they rely on one person's eye witness testimony
sw04272-B_008604-008898 something like that i don't think would be substantial enough
sw04272-B_008898-009676 uh you know somewhere where twenty people s[aw]- watched one person mowed gunned down you know five people
sw04272-B_009676-010018 that's a clear case of a person who should be executed
sw04272-B_010018-010681 and i unfortunately that that is not the situation right now those k[inds]- the punishment is not set up in most states
sw04272-B_010787-011158 you know because_1 as you stated earlier there are some crimes that's so barbaric
sw04272-B_011158-011726 they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished
sw04272-B_012884-013128 yeah but unfortunately not in all cases
sw04272-B_013128-013370 that is really the sad part about it
sw04272-B_013472-013940 uh the case in Texas where the person uh shot the restaurant
sw04272-B_013940-014191 i guess it's Ruby's or someplace like that
sw04272-B_014191-014494 he ended up killing himself but if he had survived
sw04272-B_014494-014645 uh
sw04272-B_014645-015297 by some chance i think it would have been criminal if our system had allowed him to live in prison for life
sw04272-B_017230-017352 um-hum
sw04272-B_017511-017749 well i don't think they're necessarily insane
sw04272-B_017920-018046 yeah
sw04272-B_018178-018490 i i think some people can [vocalized-noise]
sw04272-B_018490-018877 fool th[e]- system into believing that they're truly insane
sw04272-B_018877-019644 it and i'm i even if they are insane yeah i'm s[ort]- i'm s[ort]- really sort of a hard core on this w[ell]- uh Dahmer as an example
sw04272-B_019644-020010 yeah there are pr[obably]- seventeen or so victims of his crimes
sw04272-B_020010-020257 we're going to take care of him in prison
sw04272-B_020257-020745 uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation
sw04272-B_020745-021030 and that's going to cost us a lot of money
sw04272-B_021030-021361 and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that
sw04272-B_021361-021732 you know whether he w[as]- uh whether he wa[s]- ill or not
sw04272-B_021732-021998 um the crimes were heinous
sw04272-B_021998-022135 uh
sw04272-B_022135-022593 yes it's uh it['s]- a good example of where capital punishment would come in handy
sw04272-B_023527-023662 um-hum
sw04272-B_024163-024309 well then
sw04272-B_025309-025795 well i[t]- i[t]- i mea[n]- wha[t]- what what would make him rational twenty years of rehabilitation
sw04272-B_025795-026600 is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate
sw04272-B_026600-027098 and who it's questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them_1 in rehabilitating them in the first place
sw04272-B_028039-028169 um-hum
sw04272-B_028169-028523 well i think the state you know it's one thing to torture someone
sw04272-B_028523-028708 when you're ending their life
sw04272-B_028708-029259 which uh was done in the ancient times it's another thing to
sw04272-B_029259-029613 re[latively]- relatively painlessly inject someone with with uh
sw04272-B_029613-029795 uh medication to

sw04273-A_013665-014615 sure i i imagine i[t]- it it it it really was because see you had to d[o]- run at least three cu[rricula]- three separate curricula in parallel and uh-huh
sw04273-A_015531-015665 right
sw04273-A_015665-015938 how how long did you do this for
sw04273-A_016153-016414 three years okay
sw04273-A_016980-017105 um-hum
sw04273-A_017207-017723 oh so so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay
sw04273-A_017833-017986 uh-huh
sw04273-A_018136-018267 um-hum
sw04273-A_019721-019847 yeah
sw04273-A_020610-020914 [laughter]
sw04273-A_021058-021453 oh you mean you didn't have to take them_1 to like a central location a[nd]-

sw04273-A_021548-021869 oh they sent them_1 t[o]- oh boy yeah um-hum
sw04273-A_022363-022499 uh-huh
sw04273-A_023343-024507 wh[y]- why why did you d[ecide]- i mean di[d]- did you decide like to to do that home schooling because you didn't think the your local schools were were good enough [vocalized-noise] or
sw04273-A_025059-025324 uh-huh oh [noise]
sw04273-A_025324-025549 [noise]
sw04273-A_026358-027281 yeah di[d]- um well what did you think about like y[ou]- you know you obviously paying taxes for for the for for schools did i mean di[d]-
sw04273-A_028206-028339 right
sw04273-A_028900-029022 uh
sw04273-A_029303-029952 you didn't worry about it what uh eventually you put your kids back in back in to public school how did that
sw04273-B_000005-000954 yeah well i i can tell you here's an interesting interesting story uh my wife uh when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids
sw04273-B_000954-001075 a[nd]-
sw04273-B_001446-002146 yeah it's it's interestingly uh there're a couple of different ca[tegories]- categories of home school uh children
sw04273-B_002146-002453 uh a lot of people take religious exemptions
sw04273-B_002453-003249 and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and
sw04273-B_003249-003826 and you know so they don't want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch [noise]
sw04273-B_003826-004679 but uh [laughter] but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational you know whatever
sw04273-B_004679-005463 uh because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said uh hey look you know we have enough education to to school our kids
sw04273-B_005463-006521 and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school uh level instead of the public schools and do that at at home uh eight six uh eight seven and four
sw04273-B_006521-007111 uh so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling
sw04273-B_007111-007785 and uh you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of um
sw04273-B_007785-008507 you know it was really complete i mean uh it matched up pretty well with with uh actually ma[tched]- i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but
sw04273-B_008507-009380 anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all uh sort of a religious stuff with all the the creation and stuff slant on it
sw04273-B_009380-009831 but uh there's actually a lot of uh to us anyway there's a lot of other good stuff out there too
sw04273-B_009831-010459 so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six
sw04273-B_010569-010775 yeah e[xactly]- exactly
sw04273-B_010775-011064 and uh so you know went through it
sw04273-B_011064-011796 and uh anyway my my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter
sw04273-B_011796-012069 a[nd]- the oldest one the eight year old
sw04273-B_012069-012296 got to the third grade point
sw04273-B_012296-012731 and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just
sw04273-B_012731-013723 you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work
sw04273-B_014283-014426 right
sw04273-B_014426-014581 exactly
sw04273-B_014581-015636 now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the
sw04273-B_015636-015797 but i[t]- it w[as]-
sw04273-B_015899-016258 uh she did it for three years
sw04273-B_016258-017319 and and actually the kids did really you know uh if you if you believe the tests that uh the state hands out here you know they're supposed to test your uh your
sw04273-B_017491-017654 yeah
sw04273-B_017654-017981 right they took a standardized test and uh
sw04273-B_017981-018467 they they always did really well uh and they never seemed to have any problem with it
sw04273-B_018467-019783 but i can see in a lot of cases like i[t]- i[t]- we didn't in a case where you've got people at home where they don't for for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they don't want their kids to go to school
sw04273-B_019783-021155 i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because_1 we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know
sw04273-B_021343-021608 oh no no they sent them_1 to you
sw04273-B_021709-022633 yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them_1 and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure you'd be under
sw04273-B_022633-023395 but uh you know we heard s[tories]- we heard all kinds of stories of people you know it's like well if my kid doesn't do well on it i'll just write in the answers you know uh [noise]
sw04273-B_023395-023632 [laughter]
sw04273-B_024372-024806 y[es]- we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance
sw04273-B_024806-025196 because we never went to the schools to find out what they really were doing [laughter]
sw04273-B_025196-026151 it was [laughter-just] [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] it was just sort of uh you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was she's from the Bronx in New York so you know
sw04273-B_026151-026429 she knew that public schools could be pretty bad
sw04273-B_026429-026563 and uh
sw04273-B_026971-027100 yeah
sw04273-B_027201-027869 oh actually we didn't really begrudge that you know because_1 i mean it's like you know [vocalized-noise] me i mean it's g[ood]- it's good that uh
sw04273-B_027869-028242 t[o]- you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school
sw04273-B_028242-029530 they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them_1 alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah
sw04273-B_029772-029952 right
sw04274-A_000000-000128 [noise]
sw04274-A_000128-000796 well i'm one of those grey haired old guys that doesn't think that there's anything wrong with it how about_1 you
sw04274-A_003928-004202 well tha[t]- that's an interesting question
sw04274-A_004302-004483 f[rom]- from the stand point of
sw04274-A_004584-004871 to me uh a general uh uh
sw04274-A_004871-005098 you know a a general question is
sw04274-A_005215-005972 all all substances the particular question in my mind is uh it's very easy
sw04274-A_005972-006152 to go from
sw04274-A_006152-006459 from uh how should i say it uh
sw04274-A_006730-007114 [laughter] well let me put it this way from very minor use
sw04274-A_007114-007560 to uh to very significant use in a short time
sw04274-A_007560-007824 and uh
sw04274-A_007927-008277 yes alcohol is uh one of the most and
sw04274-A_008277-008484 when i was growing up uh
sw04274-A_008484-008661 i- i was
sw04274-A_008661-009033 lucky enough to belong to a family that was
sw04274-A_009033-010365 where we didn't have to say well dad why how should i say th[is]- alcohol and and uh tobacco and all those substances were off limits and at the time i i kind of thought well this is a strict house and
sw04274-A_010365-010869 then as i grew older uh in fact one of the guys told me said you were kind of lucky
sw04274-A_010869-011772 the stuff that we're all trying to quit right now uh smoking a[nd]- and uh coffee and things like that are things that you never had to that you don't have to quit
sw04274-A_011772-012106 uh but i- i'm i'm not talking [laughter-about]
sw04274-A_012106-012505 you know about_1 moral character here as much as i am just talking about
sw04274-A_012505-012684 um
sw04274-A_012684-013008 most of the things that that parents
sw04274-A_013008-013313 in how should i say it th[e]- the big issue was
sw04274-A_013313-013840 why can't i do this if you do that dad i mean you come home and have your martini right
sw04274-A_014093-014663 yeah that was a definite opening for the for the you do your thing and i'll do mine
sw04274-A_014663-015508 um in my particular case i think that all of those or like alcohol is a is a severe problem
sw04274-A_015508-015769 it's happens to be traditionally
sw04274-A_015769-016044 uh and
sw04274-A_016044-016808 uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user
sw04274-A_016808-017548 and if they have to spot the occasional user in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from
sw04274-A_017648-018289 [noise] from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly in this game i've been told
sw04274-A_020117-020440 uh well yes and also the others too i mean i'm
sw04274-A_020440-020598 i'm not uh
sw04274-A_020699-020864 uh i guess
sw04274-A_020986-021660 the way i'm approaching this is it's tough to defend half of the playing field if you don't defend the whole playing field you know
sw04274-A_021660-022441 and uh the playing field in in this case is uh some people are trying to say well it's just uh marijuana or cocaine or whatever
sw04274-A_022441-023009 uh and i think that's a tough a tough proposition it always has been and and it gave a lot of my
sw04274-A_023009-023218 uh friend's parents fits
sw04274-A_024055-024761 uh and i you know that doesn't effect your job performance i think as a as a real tough uh
sw04274-A_024761-025335 issue and if i were if i were convinced i mean [vocalized-noise] you know you and i are just talking here and
sw04274-A_025335-025592 h[ow]- how should i say it this is
sw04274-A_025592-026200 talk for pay so i'm not trying to attack you personally but but uh
sw04274-A_026302-026898 uh the problem is that i think it does effect performance and and
sw04274-A_026898-027187 you can go from a from a
sw04274-A_027187-027767 from no stress at all in your life to being [vocalized-noise] significantly stressed uh in a day
sw04274-A_027867-028000 right and when the
sw04274-A_028861-028997 yeah
sw04274-B_000000-000201 [noise] think of drug testing
sw04274-B_000745-001508 i don't know i i see it as as a bit of a privacy issues why do you need to tell the company any information i can definitely see it
sw04274-B_001508-002361 in the case where there's a problem that you know the person's performance is bad or where they have uh you know they suspect something wrong with the person
sw04274-B_002361-003029 but in a case where there's no problem and nothing suspected what does the random testing do
sw04274-B_003029-004164 especially since they're only testing for certain things they're not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job
sw04274-B_006458-006827 recreational use
sw04274-B_007447-007985 yes that's true of lots and lots of things
sw04274-B_008180-008362 um-hum
sw04274-B_010300-010437 um-hum
sw04274-B_011208-011338 yeah
sw04274-B_012237-012384 right
sw04274-B_013558-014247 um-hum yes it's definitely the do as i say not as i do question
sw04274-B_015456-015668 um-hum
sw04274-B_018251-018763 yeah now i think that's more related to other stresses outside
sw04274-B_018763-020177 you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of alcoholism
sw04274-B_020367-020500 yeah
sw04274-B_021560-021712 um-hum
sw04274-B_022369-022499 right
sw04274-B_023184-024155 yeah but you know i[t]- it i i think there's a broader issue there is does a company have a right to know something about a person that doesn't effect their job performance
sw04274-B_025164-025286 right
sw04274-B_027768-027898 yes
sw04274-B_027898-028968 uh i i i think that's to a large extent most people you know let's le[t's]- take alcohol since that seems to be the more public knowledge and more studied of these type of things
sw04274-B_028968-029856 um i think there's more of a predisposition to it that a lot of people when they get stressed out you and i

sw04275-A_028720-029441 she's she's a lawyer and so she works you know everyday nine to five and uh she keeps really long hours at the office and uh
sw04275-A_029441-029875 she's got a little two year old boy and she now has a live in
sw04275-B_000000-000103 [noise]
sw04275-B_000103-000373 so child care do you have any children
sw04275-B_000373-000565 uh-huh
sw04275-B_000565-001596 yeah we have two we have uh a four year old and a two year old at least they will be in April i'm getting used to calling them that since they're all prepared for their birthdays
sw04275-B_001740-001879 [noise]
sw04275-B_001879-003136 uh yes and no uh and my f[our]- uh three almost four year old is been in a preschool half a day uh since September it's a Montessori school
sw04275-B_003136-003870 and in a sense that's a day care although we don't use it for day care we chose it because of the educational features of the school
sw04275-B_003870-004629 uh prior to that we had a woman come over uh one or two afternoons a week
sw04275-B_004629-005611 and uh provide in home day care uh more or less to give my wife you know a break in the afternoons to uh go out and run errands and do things
sw04275-B_005611-006751 um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we don't really
sw04275-B_006751-007625 it's not that we don't trust but we just don't feel comfortable with uh [noise] uh younger kids uh early teens
sw04275-B_007625-008499 uh we've been pretty fortunate we've had babysitters that tend to be in their late teens they drive over in their own cars
sw04275-B_008499-009342 uh the older woman who watches the the kids during the day sometimes comes over in the evening [noise] so
sw04275-B_009342-010108 i i've been saved i've only had to take babysitters home twice i guess which isn't bad but we have uh
sw04275-B_010108-011160 a[ll]- all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isn't there for us
sw04275-B_011160-011983 we don't have uh i mean [vocalized-noise] my my wife has a younger sister who's ten years younger but has children the same age as
sw04275-B_011983-012653 and we were asking Denise one time well how much do you pay for babysitters she goes i don't know i've only paid one [laughter-once]
sw04275-B_012653-013279 yeah and that was you know after three years but she just has in-laws and siblings and
sw04275-B_013279-014492 uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of uh young families and our neighbors seem to be mostly retired
sw04275-B_014492-015558 plus it's harder to to impose on uh you know neigh[bors]- uh they're willing to take the kids but it's it feels difficult to impose when they don't have kids themselves
sw04275-B_015736-015980 do you ever do any babysitting yourself
sw04275-B_017569-017864 um-hum it's a it's a great job
sw04275-B_017864-018318 uh you know for the most part uh especially you know in our house it's
sw04275-B_018318-019441 it's clean and neat and the refrigerator's stocked and most the time when they come over in the evening it's you know an hours worth of of real care and then the rest is just taking responsibility for sleeping children
sw04275-B_019542-020052 we did have uh one occurrence that was kind of interesting we had two women that came
sw04275-B_020052-020858 [noise] alternatively uh when our daughter was about one year old and uh
sw04275-B_020858-021879 it wasn't a problem situation but it was one that just made my wife somewhat nervous the woman wasn't quite together she was easily distracted
sw04275-B_021879-023122 she was nice enough the kids uh you know my my daughter liked her but we ended up uh choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and
sw04275-B_023122-024820 [noise] it was a tough one because it was convenient for us she was dependable in in that she would show up but we just didn't feel comfortable and we see our friends who have kids the same age making more easy decisions uh
sw04275-B_024820-025521 meaning that uh they're they seem to be pretty lax in in who comes in and who watches them
sw04275-B_025521-026495 we have a friend who has a large house and they have uh three kids under four years old they have twins and they're in
sw04275-B_026495-027414 they have a live-in housekeeper and it just isn't a person that we would have even to our home on a a regular basis much less on a
sw04275-B_027414-027998 uh live-in basis just different value systems and uh different
sw04275-B_028111-028457 different attitude towards child rearing
sw04275-B_029699-029875 um-hum
sw04276-A_000000-000815 [noise] uh it was interesting i just read in the paper the other day that they finally sent up the the uh former Soviets whatever you call them_1 now
sw04276-A_000815-001498 recently set up some relief for the guy that's been up orbiting the mirror space [laughter-station] for the last ten months
sw04276-A_001903-002756 boy i would think so that's incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated
sw04276-A_003559-005010 no no i don't think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i don't maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh United States space program to
sw04276-A_005010-005819 uh at least offer to get involved with them in in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and
sw04276-A_005819-006055 get some sort of a union going
sw04276-A_006964-007245 yeah i hope so i'd like to see something like that
sw04276-A_008806-009669 right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about
sw04276-A_011596-011883 right yeah it really is it's uh
sw04276-A_011883-012295 i'd certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt
sw04276-A_012295-013228 although i guess uh certain logic could be [laughter-applied] to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years
sw04276-A_013228-014565 but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh future space station that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to Mars or something like that and
sw04276-A_014565-015300 seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so
sw04276-A_015300-015761 um i don't know like the thing that some the figment of somebody's imagination
sw04276-A_016122-016248 oh
sw04276-A_017028-017181 oh is that right
sw04276-A_018763-018896 oh really
sw04276-A_019327-020109 i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that
sw04276-A_020109-021144 they're uh starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i don't kn[ow]- i think a lot of people lump that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with
sw04276-A_021144-021463 uh scientific quest for knowledge it's
sw04276-A_021463-021763 more uh paranoid [laughter]
sw04276-A_021763-022006 preventative thing for the military
sw04276-A_024085-024859 definitely definitely in fact it seems uh that a a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far [laughter-as]
sw04276-A_024859-025447 they had plans for these things and they sent them_1 up years and years ago and they never expected them_1 to be still transmitting data back
sw04276-A_025447-025814 that's incredible some of the pictures that have come back
sw04276-A_027172-027751 yeah yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and
sw04276-A_027751-028230 probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there
sw04276-A_028230-028548 although i sure wouldn't mind being the guy that's actually up there [laughter]
sw04276-A_028548-028810 yeah ye[ah]- i think so
sw04276-A_029114-029496 i i don't think it's glamorous i probably wouldn't enjoy it
sw04276-A_029496-029808 all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back
sw04276-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04276-B_001086-001234 oh right
sw04276-B_001234-001442 [laughter]
sw04276-B_001442-001911 right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space
sw04276-B_002021-002160 um-hum
sw04276-B_002571-002720 yeah i don't think
sw04276-B_002720-003524 yeah it's it's pretty difficult to imagine i think that they don't have the same considerations for the human being as we do in this country [laughter]
sw04276-B_005725-005856 um-hum
sw04276-B_006050-006933 well i think uh may[be]- something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration
sw04276-B_007173-007657 yeah i think uh you know the they have a lot of resources over there
sw04276-B_007657-008883 and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster rockets or maybe something on [vocalized-noise] that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves
sw04276-B_009609-010051 well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine
sw04276-B_010051-011309 uh the truth i mean you listen to some sides of the story and they they don't they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then there's others who say we can learn a great deal
sw04276-B_011309-011676 it's kind of hard to figure out what's true and what's not true [laughter]
sw04276-B_012234-012367 um-hum
sw04276-B_013070-013198 right
sw04276-B_014463-014597 um-hum
sw04276-B_015008-015138 right
sw04276-B_015670-016595 yeah definitely at this point it is i have a friend who works for McDonald Douglas in California and there's a prime contractor on the on that space station
sw04276-B_016595-017095 and um i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year
sw04276-B_017095-017259 so they're going to continue
sw04276-B_017259-018575 but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but
sw04276-B_018575-019371 n[ow]- now that's only one side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you there's a lot more to be learned from it [laughter]
sw04276-B_020002-020126 right
sw04276-B_020952-021084 um-hum
sw04276-B_021654-021790 yeah
sw04276-B_021790-021927 well
sw04276-B_021927-022373 i guess i some of the i mean i see a good [noise]
sw04276-B_022373-023250 unmanned type space exploration sending uh satellites and or uh unmanned vehicles into orbit
sw04276-B_023250-024128 or to other planets like Voyager and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space
sw04276-B_025333-025507 right
sw04276-B_025712-026222 yeah and and in a lot of ways it's improving the technology in terms of um
sw04276-B_026222-027231 signal processing and and data transmission and trying to determine uh a picture from the information the very weak information they're getting back from these signals
sw04276-B_027231-027367 and tha[t's]-
sw04276-B_028162-028296 um-hum
sw04276-B_028409-028744 oh really [laughter]
sw04276-B_028744-029236 i don't know i don't know if it's quite as glamorous as it it seems like it would be [laughter]
sw04277-A_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04277-A_000986-001112 um-hum
sw04277-A_001866-002257 yeah i understand y'all have a uh or did have a
sw04277-A_002257-003331 i'm not sure if she's the head of the supreme court or she's pretty liberal it's hard to get anyone convicted uh get the death penalty by her uh that you had a recent uh just like about_1 four five years ago
sw04277-A_003331-003493 i think that was the case
sw04277-A_003696-004506 or i i think California had a uh i- i [noise] i think she it was a female uh judge i think she was like the
sw04277-A_004506-004750 the head of the Supreme Court or so[mething]-
sw04277-A_004935-005363 yeah that's who it was yeah Rose i remember Rose yeah
sw04277-A_005711-005839 yeah
sw04277-A_006904-007036 um-hum
sw04277-A_007962-008161 yes smoke them_1 [laughter]
sw04277-A_008161-008805 yeah i i i feel sort of in favor of you know for certain crimes um i think they ought to
sw04277-A_008805-009763 um like y[ou]- you i think you should have one appeal in one year you know to get it get it in if you don't get it done in that period of time you know
sw04277-A_009763-010113 cover all your g[round]- all your g[round]- all your bases in in one appeal
sw04277-A_010113-010893 becau[se_1]- in you know like this guy Bundy you know down in Florida you know [laughter] he's [laughter-stretched] [laughter-it] out for what thirteen fourteen years you know
sw04277-A_010893-011080 uh yeah
sw04277-A_011080-011377 just uh tying up the courts and
sw04277-A_011773-011907 um-hum
sw04277-A_012562-012710 yeah
sw04277-A_012710-013418 yeah i think in i'm not sure what the average here in Georgia but i think it's like yeah a[t]- at least ten years
sw04277-A_013418-013899 you know a[t]- at least ten years and i[t]- it's probably a little bit more than that but
sw04277-A_013899-014045 uh
sw04277-A_014045-014221 yeah they
sw04277-A_014753-014882 uh-huh
sw04277-A_015883-016012 yeah
sw04277-A_016369-017317 yeah some uh some of these guys you know it's just like uh you know a dog that's got rabies or not rabies but just a dog that goes around biting people you know you just
sw04277-A_017317-017680 uh you know you just get him out of society [laughter]
sw04277-A_017680-018572 it's it's really no i don't really see any difference i mean a lot of people can argue you know oh human life you know well you know what about this guy [vocalized-noise] you know
sw04277-A_018572-018752 did all these heinous crimes and and
sw04277-A_019577-020002 yeah you know and and not really out of sense of revenge
sw04277-A_020002-020927 although if it happened to me it would be [laughter-revenge] you know [laughter] but i mean [laughter] if it [laughter-happens] to the other guy you know not not necessarily uh you know society's revenge
sw04277-A_020927-021358 on this guy but just you know they guy's just he he just can't function in society you know
sw04277-A_021358-021613 and and you know so get rid of him
sw04277-A_021613-021807 and and uh
sw04277-A_021807-022508 you know just course it it probably have to be pretty bad crimes i would think but you know there's a l[ot]- plenty of them_1 out there you know
sw04277-A_023053-023198 yeah
sw04277-A_023198-023540 yeah that that would be a good way of doing it
sw04277-A_023856-023996 yeah
sw04277-A_024576-024703 yeah
sw04277-A_024703-025725 yeah i just it ju[st]- it is just a shame that they they waste so much and i think it costs extra money to keep someone on death row versus you know just a regular uh area
sw04277-A_026415-026543 yeah
sw04277-A_026775-026905 yeah
sw04277-A_026905-027438 [laughter] i think we can spend the money you know better elsewhere [laughter]
sw04277-A_027820-027948 yeah
sw04277-A_028088-028418 yeah yeah it's pretty bad out here in Atlanta too it's
sw04277-A_028418-028818 i we we live kind of north of Atlanta so it's not too bad but
sw04277-A_028818-029193 you know it just it just crazy all over i reckon
sw04277-A_029193-029354 [laughter]
sw04277-A_029354-029530 yeah they uh
sw04277-A_029530-029885 they['re]- they're they're also struggling with uh jail
sw04277-B_000003-000087 uh-huh
sw04277-B_000087-000489 um i don't know how capital punishment is handled in your state
sw04277-B_000489-001883 but uh in California you typically have to go through a big long um process that typically cost several million dollars um and there hasn't been anybody um executed here for about twenty years
sw04277-B_002909-003038 um-hum
sw04277-B_003446-003738 so so four five years ago you had someone
sw04277-B_004444-004637 oh [laughter]
sw04277-B_004637-005033 i think that was uh someone na[med]- i th[ink]- i think it was uh Rosebird
sw04277-B_005033-005158 yeah
sw04277-B_005260-006156 but but the the whole controversy is that you you just spend so much money now to either either they have to change the process or um
sw04277-B_006156-006969 uh i don't know do something to to expedite i'm i don't believe uh i really don't have strong feelings either way whether it should be allowed or not
sw04277-B_006969-007586 um i do know that if it was a crime against you know if it'd happen to me
sw04277-B_007586-008049 i think i'd want i'd i- i i'd feel pretty strongly about
sw04277-B_008049-008241 with death yeah [laughter]
sw04277-B_010020-010170 yep
sw04277-B_010438-010575 um-hum
sw04277-B_010829-011202 i know it it's ridiculous it really is and
sw04277-B_011347-012340 i don't know i don't know if it's any better uh i mean Florida has more executions but i don't know if it's any better down there than i[f]- if the process is is any better i mean
sw04277-B_012340-012770 they're getting people through but does it still cost a lot of money to do all this
sw04277-B_013894-014108 yeah it that's amazing
sw04277-B_014108-014431 because_1 they they have they have one guy here um
sw04277-B_014431-015069 uh he's like Robert Alton uh Harris or something and i mean his crime was so heinous
sw04277-B_015069-015479 and they're having so much trouble over this guy that
sw04277-B_015479-016290 i[t]- you know in his [vocalized-noise] you know it seems like a clear cut case to me that they're just going to have trouble o[n]- on a lot of these
sw04277-B_017259-017416 [laughter]
sw04277-B_017560-017720 that's right
sw04277-B_018510-018684 exactly
sw04277-B_018684-019038 exactly yeah i'd i uh
sw04277-B_019038-019647 like i said if it if it happened to me i'd [noise] i'd feel the way i'd i'd feel that that person should die
sw04277-B_019647-019782 and uh
sw04277-B_020176-020411 yeah [laughter-yeah]
sw04277-B_021299-021443 that's right
sw04277-B_021550-021883 i agree
sw04277-B_022455-023279 yeah i always thought [vocalized-noise] for an interesting idea would be to i don't now let the victims decide what happens to the guy they can forgive them_1
sw04277-B_023279-023407 and
sw04277-B_023523-024189 but i don't know i guess that that's a whole legal question there uh i don't know if they'd want to get into but
sw04277-B_024290-024652 but yeah that's pretty much my thoughts on the the subject
sw04277-B_025527-026077 i'm not i'm not sure i th[ink]- i think the figure i just a matter of fact just saw something on TV the other day on this and they
sw04277-B_026077-026860 they said uh it lost cost like twenty thousand dollars a year to keep them_1 in prison it's like a million dollars for them_1 to go through the appeal process
sw04277-B_026860-027008 it's like Jes[us]-
sw04277-B_027008-027131 [noise]
sw04277-B_027292-028176 yeah i mean we we have so many things on our ballots here in California to increase the jail size and it's just so much crime that's going on now
sw04277-B_028364-028522 yeah
sw04277-B_029122-029243 yep
sw04277-B_029243-029385 have to do something
sw04278-A_000000-001029 [noise] oh sure i guess this sort of relevant for me because_1 i'm a college student so you know i would have been affected by it you know a couple years ago i guess probably or after i graduate i don't know how it would be set up
sw04278-A_001029-001472 um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be
sw04278-A_001579-002395 uh sort of a bonding experience in a sense for people in the country and the you know people of of uh sort of all different uh
sw04278-A_002395-003597 you know socioeconomic racial uh you know geographic even uh you know groups who would be mixed together and would sort of work together which i think would be a positive thing
sw04278-A_003799-004313 yeah i mean i you know i think i think that that that would be a very probably the most positive part of it
sw04278-A_004313-004701 and you know it's also good to do uh to do volunteer work
sw04278-A_004701-005418 but on the other side i sort of you know wonder whether or not the government uh would run a program like this intelligently i mean
sw04278-A_006816-007406 yeah i mean the for example the Peace Corps has been a real success i think but the problem with that is that
sw04278-A_007406-008862 uh y[ou]- you know it's a it's a small program and i don't know whether they could find worthwhile work um for everyone in the country sort of uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to
sw04278-A_008862-010029 to not spend as much money as they should i mean they'd say look we have all this free labor let's not spend any money and so they would end up using people and their talents very inefficiently
sw04278-A_010724-010924 yeah
sw04278-A_011228-012179 yeah i mean i think yeah again if i[t]- if the if it was used efficiently and people you know worked on on real problems as opposed to just sort of make work
sw04278-A_012179-012548 then uh i think it could have very positive impact
sw04278-A_012548-013149 um i just i haven't seen i haven't seen any of the detailed proposals for that i don't have you
sw04278-A_013149-013599 i mean i know people sort of floated the idea around but um
sw04278-A_013599-013844 i don't really know that much about it
sw04278-A_016104-016245 hm
sw04278-A_018511-018648 hm
sw04278-A_019393-020312 yeah and th[e]- part of the problem i mean e[ven]- even i think probably a little bit of the problem with the military is that you know people only stay for a few years a lot of the people and so there's not
sw04278-A_020449-021713 yeah and there but there's no sort of continuity to it i mean you don't have people that sort of feel responsible for uh you know the area they're working or whatever i think you'd have that problem even worse if people were only in for a year
sw04278-A_021713-021883 and they probably wouldn't
sw04278-A_022036-022811 yeah and they and they probably wouldn't hire enough permanent personnel to really you know make the glue to keep the whole thing functioning well
sw04278-A_022811-023953 um so i yeah i i don't know i mean i i think if if it could be made to work well it would be a good idea if it would just be sort of a giant waste of people's time
sw04278-A_023953-024425 then i think it would be you know exactly that a waste of time and money
sw04278-A_025730-025888 yeah i
sw04278-A_025888-026480 yeah i do think i mean i do think that's that's one part of it you would have to pay people i mean
sw04278-A_026480-027159 and either that or you know sort of like the mi[litary]- i mean the military doesn't pay people very much but you know they provide housing or whatever i mean
sw04278-A_027260-027842 yeah you've got to be able to you know to pay people to live more or less i mean you can't expect them
sw04278-A_028161-028979 yeah yeah you nee[d]- you need to uh you need to provide a way for people to li[ve]- so for that reason alone it would be it would be expensive
sw04278-A_028979-029452 um and so maybe that's almost one of the big drawbacks to it
sw04278-B_000000-000056 [noise]
sw04278-B_001964-002108 um-hum
sw04278-B_003545-003871 that would be a good coming of age experience
sw04278-B_005376-006864 yeah that's a really big problem and that's my main objection to something like that today looking at uh the track record on um you know responsible management i'd really have to say that i think it'd be guaranteed that the government would have a real problem
sw04278-B_009518-009759 um-hum yeah
sw04278-B_009929-010820 yeah that is a big problem especially with organizations get bigger and bigger but there are a lot of l[ittle]- little problems like uh illiteracy
sw04278-B_010820-011310 uh some other things that could stand having some manpower thrown at it
sw04278-B_012503-012629 yeah
sw04278-B_013140-013344 no i have no idea
sw04278-B_013786-014816 in the early eighties um for economic reasons and wanting money to go to school i went into the Marine Corps for four years and
sw04278-B_014816-015408 the mismanagement and the waste there was really disgusting totally really disturbing
sw04278-B_015408-016186 remember uh the first year that i paid a thousand dollars in federal income tax i watched that thousand dollars wasted that day
sw04278-B_016186-017515 there were some radios that um had been sitting on a shelf and they had some schedule or every eight months they had to be checked whether they were used or not and that's a practical idea but before i left i saw those very same radios rotate through again
sw04278-B_017515-017806 and they'd been through many times before
sw04278-B_017806-017907 [noise]
sw04278-B_017907-018721 items that have been contracted out and paid for and th[at]- that in the end hadn't been built to specifications all kinds of stuff like that that was really disturbing
sw04278-B_018721-019459 for you know a big organization like that that a lot of people go off and do the kind of coming of age thing as well
sw04278-B_020134-020591 yeah and a lot of them_1 want out because_1 it's so disgusting [laughter]
sw04278-B_021645-022172 yeah a year's too short for any kind of continuity you're absolutely right
sw04278-B_024413-025573 yeah i wish our generation had better memory of things like the uh the New Deal and all the things that went on then when Roosevelt had uh all kinds of people working in
sw04278-B_025573-026034 they were getting paid but it was a uh you know building highways and stuff like that
sw04278-B_026366-026562 yep absolutely
sw04278-B_026977-027394 yeah there's got to be enough compensation for you to survive a year
sw04278-B_027626-028332 yeah this isn't the ancient Soviet army where you if you have the money you go in [laughter]
sw04278-B_029388-029968 yeah that and especially with the the things uh money running the way it is today and the fe[deral]-
sw04279-A_000000-000110 [noise] what kind of car do you have
sw04279-A_000547-000698 uh-huh
sw04279-A_000995-001176 yeah how do you like your Ford
sw04279-A_001824-002096 [laughter-oh] maybe that's a good sign
sw04279-A_002472-002610 yeah
sw04279-A_003249-003773 yeah i think they have that tendency i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh
sw04279-A_003773-004976 i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my w[indow]- my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced
sw04279-A_005199-005950 well yeah i they uh i had a uniform my band uniform hanging in there and they stole that so that was kind of
sw04279-A_005950-006197 kind of a bad thing but
sw04279-A_006543-006664 yeah [laughter]
sw04279-A_006664-007332 [laughter] it's pretty distinctive i don't know what in the world they wanted with it i think it was just kids you know neighborhood kids or something
sw04279-A_008312-008478 yeah
sw04279-A_008746-008956 yeah actually uh
sw04279-A_009382-009516 uh-huh
sw04279-A_009899-010026 all right
sw04279-A_010026-010449 [laughter] well actually with regard to Ford
sw04279-A_010449-010711 the the truck has not been too bad to me
sw04279-A_010711-010981 but i don't like Ford
sw04279-A_010981-011219 a[t]- at all the company itself
sw04279-A_011219-011626 because i did have a few problems and they've been utterly non responsive
sw04279-A_011626-012079 so whoever i meet i always tell that to them_1 just to make sure [laughter-everybody] [laughter-knows] [laughter-how] [laughter-i] [laughter-felt]
sw04279-A_012646-012776 yeah
sw04279-A_013277-013453 yeah tha[t]-
sw04279-A_013453-014620 that's great is is Raleigh so big or or or or is it so busy that you can th[at]- that you can't get in very well or or how does that work there
sw04279-A_015022-015157 hm
sw04279-A_015324-015453 that's good
sw04279-A_015640-016148 see i i live in Orlando generally but i'm up here for a year and then i go back down to Orlando
sw04279-A_016148-016757 and down there there are no appointments you go first come first serve which makes it really kind of difficult if you work
sw04279-A_016757-017545 but uh no down there i haven't had much luck except for one Ford dealership in Gainesville Florida that's really very good
sw04279-A_017673-017821 Gainesville
sw04279-A_017821-018069 oh you mean Minneapolis' a long way
sw04279-A_018400-018699 two two and a half a two and a half
sw04279-A_018997-019272 well my family lives in Gainesville
sw04279-A_019272-020523 so occasionally i go up there and and it it ha[ppened]- it so happened that my gear shift lever broke off at the stem when i was in Gainesville so i i had to i had to drive it about fifteen miles an hour [laughter-all] the way to
sw04279-A_020523-020845 to the Ford dealership but kind of an interesting thing
sw04279-A_022643-022887 wow and the first
sw04279-A_022991-023126 oh [vocalized-noise]
sw04279-A_023369-023625 the first figure you gave me twenty four hundred
sw04279-A_024368-025687 i've got one for you if you uh reverse the first two digits of that and make it forty two hundred that's approximately what i spent in two years on a seventy four Volvo i had it was constantly giving me problems [laughter]
sw04279-A_025930-026665 no this is strictly uh structural and engine repairs things that had to be done
sw04279-A_026665-026979 like new new transmission [laughter-things] [laughter-like] [laughter-that]
sw04279-A_026979-027626 i was really upset because_1 i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money [vocalized-noise]
sw04279-A_027626-027822 so uh it was
sw04279-A_027822-029068 that was one car that i really i liked it a real love hate relationship with it i liked the car because it felt good and it and it drive it drove well when i drove it but then again it had all these problems so
sw04279-A_029068-029460 it uh was kind of a bitter sweet relationship i guess
sw04279-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04279-B_000052-001038 well at the moment i got two cars one voluntary and the other one involuntary i have a ninety Taurus and a nineteen seventy three Dart which i've been trying to sell for over a year
sw04279-B_001150-002032 uh it's been fine it hasn't caused very much trouble it was a lot better than that Dart was the first year and it lasted for eighteen um the
sw04279-B_002032-003327 yeah maybe you never can tell i've uh uh you know it it got better as it got older really um it was quite reliable when it was less than ten years old it started to get a little bit less reliable once it passed its tenth birth date but
sw04279-B_004110-004238 um-hum
sw04279-B_004893-005475 somebody busted it out so they do that in Minneapolis too i just yesterday
sw04279-B_005762-005914 um
sw04279-B_006156-006719 well it's it's probably easy to catch you know if it's the band is distinctive [laughter]
sw04279-B_007224-007968 right so right here i have a list of my repairs oh i i do uh actually why didn't i bring this up i
sw04279-B_007968-008915 i i write a newsletter at Christmas time and i had an article on cars this year and i can just look at that if i can find it before our time expires um
sw04279-B_008915-010309 but it had an analysis of the cost of my uh eighteen year old car versus my newer car uh let's see there oops [laughter-trying] to yeah real time this is interesting looking up things in real time here um
sw04279-B_010657-010782 um-hum
sw04279-B_011028-011148 um-hum
sw04279-B_011592-011791 hm [noise]
sw04279-B_011960-012779 i've gone through the dealership and i[t]- dealerships used to have a bad reputation for not wanting to do service on cars that they hadn't sold but
sw04279-B_012779-013552 the local dealership here which which is not one that sold me the car they've been very good in doing the repairs not that they got the fixed the first time but
sw04279-B_013552-013686 but uh
sw04279-B_014398-014526 [noise]
sw04279-B_014526-015413 no i well i i call them_1 and say which day you know i'd like to bring it in on Thursday that's usually the best day and see if they're if it's okay and it usually is and
sw04279-B_015413-015691 you know i ask them_1 what time and they tell me
sw04279-B_016070-016236 i see uh-huh
sw04279-B_016490-016677 uh-huh
sw04279-B_016677-016844 yeah
sw04279-B_017348-017468 um-hum
sw04279-B_017468-017735 that's a long way from Orlando
sw04279-B_017735-017884 yeah
sw04279-B_017995-018439 no no no no Gainesville i know Or[lando]- Orlando aren't they about an hour and a half drive
sw04279-B_018551-019109 two and a half okay so if you live in Orlando and you go to Gainesville for repairs you must be an [vocalized-noise]
sw04279-B_019240-019369 ah okay
sw04279-B_019863-020048 um-hum
sw04279-B_020405-020531 um-hum
sw04279-B_020649-020774 ooh
sw04279-B_020774-022027 yeah okay so i find that that my total auto expenses uh dropped from twenty four hundred dollars to eighteen hundred dollars when i when i went from my old car to my new car repairs went down from
sw04279-B_022027-022733 eleven hundred ten dollars a year eighty eight to ninety nineteen ninety average to a hundred ninety four dollars in nineteen ninety one
sw04279-B_022733-023479 uh that was uh that was from backing into a post it was well hidden in a pa[rk]- in a uh a gas station uh
sw04279-B_023608-024434 excuse me yeah twenty four hundred was the expenses uh that wa[s]- that th[at]- that included gasoline repairs maintenance fees and insurance and other expenses
sw04279-B_024434-024587 um-hum
sw04279-B_024703-024946 um-hum um-hum
sw04279-B_025532-026071 wow and when y[ou]- when you say you spent it do you mean does that include gasoline or is that just repair
sw04279-B_026612-026737 yeah
sw04279-B_026944-027085 yeah
sw04279-B_027489-027707 right oh yeah
sw04279-B_028257-028396 um-hum
sw04279-B_028685-028880 um-hum
sw04279-B_029421-029853 i was uh kind of sorry i got rid of my car when i did well now i'm not because it's much
sw04280-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04280-A_000011-000193 okay um
sw04280-A_000193-000714 Bryan you've said you have one child right now have you had any problems with day with child care services
sw04280-A_002301-002482 um-hum
sw04280-A_002991-003347 did you u[tilize]- utilize that full-time while you were working
sw04280-A_003481-003638 um-hum
sw04280-A_006315-006446 um-hum
sw04280-A_007720-008109 what type of costs were you facing excessive or
sw04280-A_008339-008512 um-hum
sw04280-A_010010-010130 um-hum
sw04280-A_011754-012105 yeah we're at a stage in our life where we don't have any kids
sw04280-A_012105-012625 yeah but we're approaching that point where we're going to have make a decision as far as
sw04280-A_012625-013057 does does my wife continue to work or do i continue to work to uh
sw04280-A_013057-013957 make ends meet and do you put chil[d]- child in day care some[where]- along that lines and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child in day care
sw04280-A_013957-014370 and uh been thinking about how much that's going to cost it's uh
sw04280-A_014370-014761 rather frightening figure you really cuts into your income
sw04280-A_014761-014901 uh
sw04280-A_015020-015792 one of the things we have at our my company is uh day care reimbursement program we actually put money away into a tax free
sw04280-A_015792-015957 uh program
sw04280-A_015957-016700 um and they it's you're reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided it's used specifically and only for day care
sw04280-A_016700-017154 it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen uh that accomplished that
sw04280-A_017154-017373 i[t]- it helps out a little bit
sw04280-A_017373-017545 yeah
sw04280-A_017545-018091 but unfortunately i'm not you know able to tap into that until we have kids so that's down the road a little bit
sw04280-A_018091-018397 but i do have some brothers and sisters who are
sw04280-A_018397-018739 struggling a[s]- a[s]- as it is right now to make ends meet
sw04280-A_018739-019036 and they're also very uncomfortable with the idea of day cares
sw04280-A_019036-019324 but they're forced into that situation right now
sw04280-A_020935-021071 what's
sw04280-A_022323-022640 you know most people i know who have had to make that decision
sw04280-A_022640-023349 the spouse usually the the mother in situations that i can think of have been in tears they've dreaded the moment
sw04280-A_023349-023856 for throughout most of the pregnancy knowing that they'd have to eventually go back to work
sw04280-A_023856-024243 and uh when the time actually came to send your ch[ild]- ch[ild]- child to day care
sw04280-A_024243-024385 it was
sw04280-A_024385-024576 basically a very traumatic moment
sw04280-A_024794-025199 in my i see my wife nodding in the corner [laughter]
sw04280-A_025199-025501 as she dreads that date too i imagine
sw04280-A_025501-025947 but i[t]- uh unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without
sw04280-A_025947-026218 well very few people can get by without two incomes
sw04280-A_026218-026372 um
sw04280-A_026372-026638 least especially in the early stages of a career
sw04280-A_027870-027998 um-hum
sw04280-A_028299-028951 do you find any uh that there would be any benefits to a day care such as exposure to uh unlimited basis
sw04280-A_028951-029219 exposure to other kids um
sw04280-A_029219-029452 developing social interaction
sw04280-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04280-B_000430-000720 yes
sw04280-B_000720-002385 well y[es]- uh yes in fact we have had a uh a minor problem we've we tried to use the child care facility at the tennis club that we belong to and just didn't feel that it provided the kind of quality care that that we want for our child at this point
sw04280-B_002503-002978 um so it is in fact difficult to find uh quality services
sw04280-B_002978-003102 uh
sw04280-B_003301-004279 no um my wife doesn't work so we were just uh planning on trying to use that as a as a break in our activity and to give her a little more free time
sw04280-B_004279-006382 but the uh the the center that we went to had we've felt like uh had too many children for each counselor and so you know any any child that had any kind of problem or was just upset wasn't going to receive the kind of attention that we wanted our child to have
sw04280-B_006526-007224 and uh i'm i'm sure that's that's the problem with many uh care centers like that
sw04280-B_007224-007756 it's uh a difficult task to provide you know reasonable cost child care
sw04280-B_008050-008431 no it was uh i think it was four dollars an hour
sw04280-B_008573-008972 what i was what i was thinking of was that you know for the
sw04280-B_008972-009728 for the uh the sitter to be able to provide low cost care they you know they can't pay too much for the counselors and
sw04280-B_009728-010079 can't provide too many counselors per child
sw04280-B_010079-010460 but it's you know we're we're used to
sw04280-B_010460-010825 used to just uh just felt more comfortable
sw04280-B_010825-010998 with uh
sw04280-B_010998-011596 you know with more of a babysitter situation where the the child has has the full attention of someone
sw04280-B_011800-011921 [noise]
sw04280-B_012913-013048 right
sw04280-B_013429-013593 right
sw04280-B_014515-014642 [laughter-yeah]
sw04280-B_014776-014898 right
sw04280-B_015403-015532 hm
sw04280-B_016288-016432 right
sw04280-B_017063-017201 right
sw04280-B_017347-017479 [laughter]
sw04280-B_017863-017986 right
sw04280-B_019319-020394 yeah it's it's difficult i i don't know whether we'll find it easier when when the child gets a little bit older say one year old when it doesn't seem quite so vulnerable
sw04280-B_020394-021584 to uh you know to the outside world and my my wife keeps wondering h[ow]- you know how how anybody can turn the child over to uh
sw04280-B_021584-022367 day care and [laughter-i] [laughter-just] [laughter-tell] [laughter-her] [laughter-that] you know it's just it's not a matter of choice for most people we're fortunate we we have a choice
sw04280-B_023102-023233 right
sw04280-B_024492-024618 right
sw04280-B_025035-025248 [laughter]
sw04280-B_025398-025529 yeah
sw04280-B_026309-026524 yeah it's [vocalized-noise] true
sw04280-B_026524-026648 yeah
sw04280-B_026875-027394 yeah it it does make it difficult to because now our child's six months old and
sw04280-B_027394-027956 you know essentially my my wife hasn't been away from him from more than a few hours at a [laughter-time]
sw04280-B_027956-028336 so that takes its uh emotional toll on her
sw04280-B_029387-029907 yeah we think so we we we think that is important we're just not not sure at what
sw04281-A_000000-000084 [noise]
sw04281-A_000084-000577 so so [laughter] do you do much exercising

sw04281-A_013311-013592 no i've never had problems with my knees at all
sw04281-A_013592-013756 um
sw04281-A_013933-014065 uh the
sw04281-A_014065-014574 that's not not at all a problem it's more just uh
sw04281-A_014574-015060 the other thing i do is i run with my wife and so we go kind of out together
sw04281-A_015060-015746 and we don't run hard like like we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of
sw04281-A_015746-016254 run around together and it's not like we go real hard or anything but it's enjoyable
sw04281-A_016829-017499 oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run
sw04281-A_018936-019060 hm
sw04281-A_019434-020417 oh i do but i don't feel that it's that hard [laughter] i [noise] it's not that stressful you know you're asking about how it was on the knees or on the body and that stuff and it's not
sw04281-A_020417-020990 it's not really stressful at all in any i mean it's it's fun and it's enjoyable and it's good exercise but
sw04281-A_021766-021965 y[ou]- you do you run
sw04281-A_022857-023114 [laughter]
sw04281-A_023837-023975 um
sw04281-A_024157-024596 how about_1 swimming for a while i used to swim
sw04281-A_025284-025406 uh uh-huh
sw04281-A_027135-027259 um
sw04281-A_027383-027865 does this extend out from like high school or something like that
sw04281-A_027865-028219 athletics or anything that you used to do in high school
sw04281-A_028219-028502 i used to run some cross country in high school but
sw04281-A_029444-029593 uh-huh
sw04281-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04281-B_000050-000383 well yes [laughter]
sw04281-B_000561-000866 uh only for fun
sw04281-B_000866-001121 i really enjoy it though
sw04281-B_001121-001656 so uh let's see what do i do in the winter i play volleyball
sw04281-B_001656-001903 and i go skiing that's about it [laughter]
sw04281-B_002554-002974 well i must admit that Utah has the best snow on earth
sw04281-B_003983-004161 uh
sw04281-B_004628-005009 yeah it you know i do it for the fun i can't stand
sw04281-B_005009-005297 say stationary bicycle
sw04281-B_005297-005508 gets pretty boring or
sw04281-B_005508-005747 like uh
sw04281-B_005747-006429 you know lifting weights because_1 i can't count more than to three before i get bored and then i lose track of the repetitions
sw04281-B_006429-006759 but uh the uh
sw04281-B_006759-007525 you know the the gym's open say for volleyball on every Wednesday so so that's regular
sw04281-B_007667-007814 yeah
sw04281-B_009433-009739 so you must be over twenty then
sw04281-B_010353-011403 yeah when you're about when you're under twenty five you can pretty much get away with uh doing nothing and then when you want to get do some[thing]- something athletic you just get up and do it
sw04281-B_011403-011794 otherwise i find you've got to go every week
sw04281-B_011794-011965 everyday
sw04281-B_011965-012247 if you want to have any sort of shape
sw04281-B_012974-013264 running that doesn't bother your knees at all
sw04281-B_013264-013414 great
sw04281-B_016245-016853 well it's hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move don't you
sw04281-B_017356-017600 well even just walking
sw04281-B_017600-018294 well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything
sw04281-B_018294-018754 and just to move while running you've got to move your legs every single step
sw04281-B_019002-019498 so you don't you don't feel you're getting a good exercise when you go out uh jogging
sw04281-B_020296-020484 oh okay
sw04281-B_021057-021548 all right yeah it's not supposed to hurt i just find that it really pounds
sw04281-B_021548-021771 because_1 i'm in particular running
sw04281-B_021900-022058 no
sw04281-B_022058-022446 no that's i and i'd like to because_1 i think it'd be fun
sw04281-B_022446-023010 i run in connection with you know in case i accidentally play basketball or uh
sw04281-B_023010-023647 so you know football you know something there's all sorts of activities where you end up running
sw04281-B_023647-023699 it's just
sw04281-B_023699-023912 sort of a natural thing
sw04281-B_023912-024211 but i don't do it just for the sake of running
sw04281-B_024706-025300 yeah you know swimming is something i've gotten to the point where i action actually can do laps now
sw04281-B_025409-026162 that used to bore bore me to tears you know i'd love to swim if it was water polo or
sw04281-B_026162-026412 you know splashing about or
sw04281-B_026412-026662 you know if there was some diversion
sw04281-B_026662-027057 just uh but but that's good exercise
sw04281-B_027175-027492 yeah i'm looking forward to that it's i can
sw04281-B_028094-028214 uh
sw04281-B_028582-029500 yeah see that that gets back to this lack of discipline and training i i would never join a team because they'd want you to do these repetitions or something
sw04281-B_029500-029741 rather than let just play the game
sw04282-A_000000-000110 [noise]

sw04282-B_000030-000159 okay
sw04282-B_000300-000700 well actually interestingly enough a lot of times [laughter]
sw04282-B_000700-001979 well i just retired from the Army after twenty years of uh active uh service uh uh retired out of the Pentagon [noise] and because of the organizations that i was in in the military
sw04282-B_001979-003026 and the jobs that i held and particularly because of the security clearances that i had we had first of all we had regular random testing just because we were in the military
sw04282-B_003026-004309 right and then because of the security clearances that i held i also had uh other regular random uh drug testing for that as well that i actually had to sign an agreement saying that uh
sw04282-B_004309-004560 yeah it was all urine testing
sw04282-B_004560-005093 and it was mainly because of their concern because drug use is illegal
sw04282-B_005093-006435 uh and of course addictive uh it's a perfect thing uh for blackmail for people with high security clearances and so i've kind of over the twenty year period of time i've gotten kind of accustomed [laughter-to] [laughter-it] and
sw04282-B_006435-007013 doesn't bother me uh uh because i've always been in sensitive positions that i understand the
sw04282-B_007013-007964 the problems that can results uh as far as compromise and espionage and uh addiction and blackmail that that has never bothered me
sw04282-B_007964-008106 and uh
sw04282-B_008245-009072 uh-huh and i work for a defense contractor in Virginia called Network Solutions we uh uh we actually operate the NIC for the internet
sw04282-B_009072-009644 yeah you probably got uh uh information about this program through the internet
sw04282-B_009644-009833 right all of us did
sw04282-B_009833-010263 yep so uh now we don't have any drug testing out there
sw04282-B_010400-010534 uh-huh
sw04282-B_010898-011128 uh-huh huh
sw04282-B_011128-011277 right
sw04282-B_011455-011585 uh-huh
sw04282-B_012037-012185 um-hum
sw04282-B_012392-013454 right exactly i guess so there's uh still a good bit of discussion and controversy about whether it's an invasion of your privacy and uh that sort of thing
sw04282-B_013454-013610 [noise]
sw04282-B_014068-014363 [laughter-right] [laughter-especially] right you don't want to get caught
sw04282-B_014635-014796 um-hum
sw04282-B_015011-016128 yeah as a matter of fact uh that's such a difficult question to to answer because on the one hand sure uh uh drug testing is an invasion of property or of privacy but yet on the other hand
sw04282-B_016128-017408 for example these uh guys that drive these trains and that sort of thing that uh have been high and uh killed a lot of people yeah it's it's uh right
sw04282-B_017408-017608 [noise] um-hum
sw04282-B_017608-018858 right and i think for the most part the general public tends to support it but uh i'm sure organizations like the American Civil Liberties [vocalized-noise] Union uh the ACLU probably have their
sw04282-B_018858-019185 sure and that that can really happen
sw04282-B_019185-020599 uh and that sort of thing not just drug testing but [noise] lots of other things uh for example blood tests that determine whether you have particularly diseases or not like AIDS uh can be construed to be an invasion of prop[erty]- or of
sw04282-B_020599-021148 of privacy because it effects your insurance and your employability and
sw04282-B_021148-022262 yeah and it's it but yet if tha[t's]- that's in any kind of a computer database [laughter] somebody's going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so
sw04282-B_022262-022746 it's one of those problems that [noise] it's really hard to come up with an answer to
sw04282-B_022746-022948 and uh
sw04282-B_023113-023370 yeah oh yeah i[n]-
sw04282-B_023370-023588 um-hum
sw04282-B_023706-023897 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04282-B_023897-024279 oh yeah there were guys in the military that were selling their own urine
sw04282-B_024279-024894 [laughter] [laughter-because_1] [laughter-they] uh just had to be careful that they didn't do the test and uh show that you came up pregnant
sw04282-B_024894-025592 [laughter] depending on who you got your sample from it that could be really bad [laughter] [laughter-so] [laughter] but uh
sw04282-B_025592-025803 and they were really pr[otective]-
sw04282-B_025803-025991 um-hum
sw04282-B_025991-026714 well it depends now if you have a you know that was the other funny thing if you had a high security clearance like my people had
sw04282-B_026714-028187 uh and you got caught and these guys were shift workers it really worked out well for them because of course the first thing that happened was that their security clearance was suspended and then they were removed from access to sensitive information which means they got a straight day job at the company
sw04282-B_028187-028725 so i[t]- it was really to their advantage to get caught and
sw04282-B_028725-029914 yeah and in the long run of course uh that was a problem and it kind of depended also on [noise] on how often they uh were caught whether they were in a rehab program and
sw04283-A_000007-000154 i'll start
sw04283-A_000154-000643 um my feeling is that
sw04283-A_000643-000922 you become a politician
sw04283-A_000922-001639 perhaps because um you think you're doing something noble perhaps because you're on a power trip but
sw04283-A_001639-002108 what it all comes down to is you are doing this because you think
sw04283-A_002108-002828 that your approach is better than what another person's approach is and you're looking to impose their will upon them your will upon them
sw04283-A_002828-003035 and um
sw04283-A_003035-003253 so there's a fundamental problem
sw04283-A_003253-003689 [laughter-okay] is that y[ou]- you get into this to impose your will upon others
sw04283-A_003689-003906 if you um
sw04283-A_003906-004242 could do it you know if you didn't need to impose your will
sw04283-A_004242-004660 then you could just do it by suggesting or writing articles in newspaper or what have you
sw04283-A_005949-006639 well i think that the uh what do you call it uh you know tho[se]- those guys who took pen to parchment a couple hundred years ago
sw04283-A_006639-007274 had some good ideas and um one of the things that i think has gotten out of hand
sw04283-A_007274-007549 is what the government does
sw04283-A_007549-007769 what kind of things they get involved it
sw04283-A_007769-008043 um there was a time when
sw04283-A_008043-008389 the governm[ent]- wou[ldn't]- wouldn't think of telling you what you could eat or smoke
sw04283-A_008389-008818 um there was a time when the government wouldn't think of um
sw04283-A_008818-009592 imposing heavy taxes on transportations o[n]- on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them
sw04283-A_009592-010132 and i think tho[se]- those are the first of things that come to mind i think that um
sw04283-A_010132-010455 if what the government sets out to do
sw04283-A_010455-010661 is fairly limited
sw04283-A_010661-011112 then the people who decide they want to be politicians can't get into a whole lot of trouble
sw04283-A_011272-012172 um it's only when you try to run every aspect of life from cradle to grave that when a politician runs amok they can do serious [laughter-damage]
sw04283-A_012534-012819 oh absolutely um
sw04283-A_012819-013455 you know i think that uh we've gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well
sw04283-A_013455-013784 i think that getting ourselves out of it is going to be painful
sw04283-A_013784-014145 um i hope it happens peacefully
sw04283-A_014145-014346 because it will happen
sw04283-A_014713-015440 well we're in a situation right now where um uh the comment uh not the first thing uh even in a situation right now where um
sw04283-A_015661-016384 large portions of your life are controlled by forces that aren't particularly interested in your welfare and um
sw04283-A_016384-016744 the quality of life is deteriorating uh
sw04283-A_017027-017875 well ta[ke]- well taking half your income is uh a pretty good one uh not being permitted to defend yourself is another one um
sw04283-A_017875-018833 i don't know what the laws are like in New York in in California but in New York um if you wake up one night and go down stairs and see a fellow about to climb out the window with your TV set
sw04283-A_018833-019073 you cannot use deadly force against them
sw04283-A_019469-019625 with your TV set yeah
sw04283-A_019625-019752 um
sw04283-A_020189-020581 um well there's an interesting issue there uh
sw04283-A_020581-020973 let's suppose someone breaks the window of your car and steals your radio
sw04283-A_020973-021179 all right um
sw04283-A_021179-021552 we look at this and we say okay fine it's
sw04283-A_021658-022002 three hundred dollars damage just picking a number off the top of my head
sw04283-A_022002-022419 let's suppose you make thirty five bucks an hour uh thirty bucks an hour to make the math easy
sw04283-A_022419-022788 theoretically ten working hours of your life have just vanished
sw04283-A_022788-023527 a[nd]- and and don't quo[te]- on the uh example of insurance because that [vocalized-noise] means those ten working hours of someone else's life got [laughter-vanished]
sw04283-A_023527-024048 yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed
sw04283-A_024048-024484 you know it's it's it's it's y[ou]- y[ou]- you it's it's a um
sw04283-A_024484-025211 how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way
sw04283-A_025211-025552 you know it's not as cut and dry and radical as uh
sw04283-A_025712-025947 you know as um
sw04283-A_025947-026851 when someone is killed in cold blood but uh there is a very very subtle effect there and i think one of the problems we have with law today is that
sw04283-A_026851-027117 when somebody runs out and passes a law
sw04283-A_027117-027652 be it increase in taxes be it what have you generally speaking
sw04283-A_027652-027882 um you're not creating anything
sw04283-A_027882-028104 you're just moving stuff from one place to another
sw04283-A_028104-028296 okay you're moving
sw04283-A_028296-028983 some kind of uh you know if if you um very strongly reinforce the p[articular]- e[nforce]- e[nforce]- enforce a particular um
sw04283-A_028983-029455 civil right um one of the example that comes to mind is Miranda
sw04283-A_029455-029778 okay um which i think is a good thing
sw04283-A_029778-029962 um but
sw04283-B_000000-000056 [noise]
sw04283-B_000056-000201 okay
sw04283-B_001526-001701 um-hum
sw04283-B_002635-002804 um-hum
sw04283-B_003197-003401 [laughter-um-hum]
sw04283-B_003593-003743 um-hum
sw04283-B_004546-004721 right
sw04283-B_004721-005123 right but i[t]- it does seem like a problem that the only people
sw04283-B_005123-005597 who become president are people who want to be president
sw04283-B_005597-005992 and i don't really know if i want anybody who really wants to be president [laughter]
sw04283-B_006596-006742 um-hum
sw04283-B_006742-006886 um-hum
sw04283-B_007699-007861 that's possible
sw04283-B_009552-009700 um
sw04283-B_010575-010699 um-hum
sw04283-B_011149-011288 that's true
sw04283-B_012147-012617 that's an interesting point so you're you're taking sort of a libertarian view here
sw04283-B_013689-013828 um-hum
sw04283-B_014078-014213 um-hum
sw04283-B_014362-014783 now what sort of uh what sort of which p[art]- which sort of trouble are you speaking of
sw04283-B_016379-016541 what sort of control
sw04283-B_016651-016839 what con[trol]- what sort of controls are you thinking of
sw04283-B_017039-017279 or what sort of areas you know life
sw04283-B_017423-017575 [laughter]
sw04283-B_017575-017808 um
sw04283-B_019094-019534 well then the question is so he's climbing out the window
sw04283-B_019534-020145 with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for television theft is death
sw04283-B_020876-021026 um-hum
sw04283-B_021903-022051 um-hum
sw04283-B_022180-022314 um-hum
sw04283-B_022771-022904 oh sure
sw04283-B_023356-023623 right and you're pay for it eventually
sw04283-B_025139-025259 um-hum
sw04283-B_026414-026543 um-hum
sw04283-B_027372-027526 um-hum
sw04283-B_029407-029551 okay
sw04284-A_000000-000151 [noise] have any children
sw04284-A_000486-000593 [noise]
sw04284-A_001121-001592 well wh[at]- what do you think about child care i mean i don't have any children
sw04284-A_001592-001753 so [vocalized-noise] [noise]
sw04284-A_004882-005015 well
sw04284-A_005453-005997 well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed
sw04284-A_005997-006475 or should be in one facility at one time
sw04284-A_008814-009612 but then and well in public school um you have one teacher for every thirty kids
sw04284-A_011651-011897 well um do you think
sw04284-A_011897-012290 that there is enough child care available in your area
sw04284-A_014550-015183 um-hum well do you think that employers should provide child care
sw04284-A_016308-016446 um-hum
sw04284-A_019652-020048 well i think that really am i am
sw04284-A_020048-020584 all for employers providing some [kype/type] type of child care
sw04284-A_020584-021076 or at least the facility and i don't think we really have enough of that
sw04284-A_025106-025941 oh i know and i think that if i had children and i couldn't find adequate child care i probably wouldn't want to work
sw04284-A_026219-026597 you you [vocalized-noise] i know you really don't have a choice
sw04284-A_026597-026783 but then um
sw04284-A_026783-027085 i'm my boss had
sw04284-A_027085-027316 a case where um
sw04284-A_027316-027721 his baby got sick in child care
sw04284-A_027721-027898 and um
sw04284-A_027898-028674 all the babies at the child care place that he went to all came down with an ear infection and that's
sw04284-A_028674-029203 i think there should be some kind of [noise] um health regulation or or
sw04284-A_029309-029863 some kind of i don't know how ba[d]- i mean i can see how it could happen with all the children there together
sw04284-B_000000-000062 [noise]
sw04284-B_000062-001187 no uh i'm single and but i've i been keeping an eye on what the child care situation is and i have several friends that do have children
sw04284-B_001701-002008 well it's it's uh it's
sw04284-B_002008-003308 i- i feel that uh regulation uh whether be at the state or federal level is a must so we can have some sort of standards from one place to another uh
sw04284-B_003308-004420 that uh in terms of cleanliness uh the ratio between the uh adults to children is maintained uh
sw04284-B_004420-004721 food and so on
sw04284-B_004721-005517 i don't think one pers[on]- one adult should have like twenty children to keep after
sw04284-B_006318-007565 well the facility i i don't have a problem with it's just how many adults or how many children to an adult and i[f]- if i remember correctly um
sw04284-B_007565-007906 one adult for six children was very good
sw04284-B_007906-008781 for around here and was more twelve to twelve children one to one adult was about the average
sw04284-B_009527-010244 and so on but the but in day care usually the child is not able to um
sw04284-B_010244-010756 function totally on his own whether if i[t's]- if it's uh a toddler
sw04284-B_010756-011243 uh diapers have to be changed uh must be tended to constantly
sw04284-B_011243-011545 for fear that they might get into something
sw04284-B_012298-013394 i think there is it's just that sometimes location makes it difficult if if if i was married there is no place between my house and work
sw04284-B_013394-013894 that is convenient that i could uh use as for child care
sw04284-B_013894-014682 they're usually in areas where they can they can afford to set up shop and not where it's convenient for the people that are working
sw04284-B_015114-016392 well some companies i've noticed will provide the facilities and then let a let a uh a company come in and provide the child care while the employer's just p[roviding]- providing the the facility
sw04284-B_016392-017637 and many cases like in large companies that becomes a perk to the employees where they're able to get reduced child care and in and in the case of uh new mothers they're able to go
sw04284-B_017637-018279 uh instead of a cigarette break they can go see their child for ten minutes and then go back to work
sw04284-B_018279-019668 you have a better retention then of um people by not having them_1 go on sick leave or uh paid holiday to take care of their children and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest
sw04284-B_021028-021448 no it['s]- it's it's a relatively new idea from what i understand
sw04284-B_021448-022920 it's ha[s]- uh enough companies haven't gotten on the bandwagon they where they could see a realization and um savings of money right n[ow]- by people being at work and not taking off and being at home
sw04284-B_022920-023380 if you make it convenient for them_1 people will s[tay]- uh stay
sw04284-B_023380-023866 or stay with the company if you if there're more perks like that you can give them
sw04284-B_023866-024363 it's not just money it's it's everything about it and child care is a big issue
sw04284-B_024556-024853 it's important to me if i was married and had children
sw04284-B_024853-025170 i'd want to be as close to my kids as i possibly could
sw04284-B_025881-026511 i'm the same way but then again how do you provide for the child when you can't work
sw04284-B_029675-029863 um-hum
sw04285-A_000000-000754 [noise] Joan uh you live in a in a big city Dallas huh what's i guess crime is is a problem there or a concern isn't it
sw04285-A_000754-000976 uh-huh
sw04285-A_001198-001345 it is
sw04285-A_001345-001490 uh
sw04285-A_001883-002023 uh-huh
sw04285-A_002023-002275 what do you think is uh
sw04285-A_002554-002678 uh-huh
sw04285-A_002678-003519 well you know we we i live in a uh in a city that's uh twenty five about_1 twenty five thousand and it's in the northeast and we really don't have a
sw04285-A_003519-004440 a crime problem and we have the burglaries and the occasional bank robbery and things like that but nothing uh real serious nothing like a big city crime
sw04285-A_004440-005316 but from my observations it seems to me that uh that drugs seem to be the engine driving crime in American cities today what do you think
sw04285-A_005567-005698 um-hum
sw04285-A_005854-006087 the need for money
sw04285-A_006087-006260 uh-huh
sw04285-A_006862-007468 uh-huh i guess that's serious in uh California too in Los Angeles and some of the other cities there
sw04285-A_008124-008278 um-hum
sw04285-A_008914-009048 uh-huh
sw04285-A_009048-009788 and are the gangs uh selling are they in enterprise are they selling drugs is that one of the reasons for gangs
sw04285-A_010319-010445 uh-huh
sw04285-A_010914-011082 um-hum
sw04285-A_011328-011671 right i think if somehow or other we can
sw04285-A_011671-012385 continue to crack down on drugs uh that i think it will help reduce the crime because the need for money and
sw04285-A_012385-012816 and also the lack of judgement that comes from using drugs uh
sw04285-A_012816-013313 you know people i think have a diminished capacity to know right from wrong when they're using drugs
sw04285-A_013527-013653 uh-huh
sw04285-A_015331-015468 uh-huh
sw04285-A_016366-016637 that's big up here to and and
sw04285-A_016637-016793 right
sw04285-A_016793-017052 right and i think that's an effective program
sw04285-A_017891-018104 um-hum
sw04285-A_018891-019030 um-hum
sw04285-A_019729-019891 um-hum
sw04285-A_020256-020356 [noise]
sw04285-A_020356-020645 teaching the dangers of it uh-huh
sw04285-A_020851-021088 yeah i think that's that's true i think
sw04285-A_022408-022550 um-hum
sw04285-A_022737-023410 do you have a program called DARE down there also [noise] right well that's that's uh active up here
sw04285-A_023870-023995 uh-huh
sw04285-A_024112-024266 right
sw04285-A_026065-026758 sure is you find that uh do you f[ind]- is it your observation that most of the crime is in a certain age group
sw04285-A_026758-027214 certain range of ages twenty five something or
sw04285-A_027370-027499 no
sw04285-A_028164-028350 oh is that right um
sw04285-A_028613-029034 how about_1 the gang membership that seems to be mainly teenagers
sw04285-A_029139-029306 uh-huh
sw04285-A_029523-029651 uh-huh
sw04285-B_000000-000065 [noise]
sw04285-B_000259-000390 right
sw04285-B_000673-001266 um-hum a big one it is and and uh getting out to the suburbs heavily
sw04285-B_001266-002039 yeah and i work in a high school here and we're just starting to see weapons in the high school in the suburbs and that's scary
sw04285-B_002168-002646 much different situation than we had even three years ago you know
sw04285-B_003245-003379 um-hum
sw04285-B_004214-004354 um-hum
sw04285-B_004354-004476 um-hum
sw04285-B_005253-006290 right i think it's the basis for every for it all really it's a big part of what our problem is and this gang situation which is which
sw04285-B_006290-006927 comes from you know the drugs are involved in it but it the gang situation is very serious here also
sw04285-B_007156-007404 right
sw04285-B_007404-007876 right but even in our suburbs here and in our school we're you know we're
sw04285-B_007876-008495 it's not a noticeable down the hall thing you know yelling in our suburb but it's still is
sw04285-B_008495-009076 enough that you know which one's you pretty well pick out which ones are in the gang type
sw04285-B_009614-010230 well o[ne]- one of it right but another thing is just territory you know they just want to
sw04285-B_010230-010398 control things
sw04285-B_010398-010557 and uh
sw04285-B_010557-011015 but drugs is a major is is the major i would say
sw04285-B_011015-011438 problem of them_1 all all of our cri[me]- you know the basis of it
sw04285-B_011438-011584 yeah
sw04285-B_011858-012020 um-hum
sw04285-B_013280-013442 that's true
sw04285-B_013442-013612 that's true
sw04285-B_013612-013789 but um
sw04285-B_013789-014029 we also have um
sw04285-B_014029-015419 oh we have a lot of our um counselors and all they've come up with so many groups that they didn't use to have to have you know as far as the counseling and coming up with the student groups student help groups
sw04285-B_015419-015588 and um
sw04285-B_015588-016003 of course the the say no to drugs and this and um
sw04285-B_016003-016390 Students Against Drunk Driving is very big in our school
sw04285-B_016543-016853 SADD which is very big
sw04285-B_016992-017658 i do but uh us all that basis that they start but i i think they're pr[obably]- finally
sw04285-B_017658-018103 uh realizing that they have to start in the primary grades
sw04285-B_018103-019007 training these kids and i some of the programs you see on the TV i haven't seen a whole lot of them_1 in our schools here
sw04285-B_019007-019837 but um some of the programs that they're showing in the primary where they're starting out right in the first second kindergarten grades
sw04285-B_019837-020019 having the um
sw04285-B_020019-020445 play[s]- you know plays the whole thing role playing
sw04285-B_020445-020886 um-hum but they off drugs i think it's a good situation
sw04285-B_021000-022058 and i think it's going to have to start there because it's not wor[king]- you know it overall it's such a large payola and all in the actual when i[t]- when it gets up to the
sw04285-B_022058-022478 older people and the um law enforcement and all that
sw04285-B_022478-022772 i think that's being paid off big time
sw04285-B_022940-023066 um-hum
sw04285-B_023346-023950 right but that's all recent you know that's all been in the last three about_1 four years
sw04285-B_023950-024238 that they've come in with all of those
sw04285-B_024238-025650 and had to so and and the alcohol is a big there another big you know well the drugs is part of the alcohol is the drugs but i mean alcohol is also a major problem [vocalized-noise] these kids that are you know
sw04285-B_025650-026137 tenth graders come into school a[ll]- all ready loaded that's pretty scary
sw04285-B_026879-027116 um
sw04285-B_027116-027778 yeah no[t]- not r[eally]- necessarily no not necessarily anymore yes it used to be
sw04285-B_027778-028327 but anymore you'd find a lot of the younger thirteen fourteen in that age group
sw04285-B_028327-028678 is um starting heavily into it
sw04285-B_028678-028834 caliber
sw04285-B_028948-029258 and that's mainly uh so far
sw04285-B_029258-029615 that's pretty well into the tee[nagers]- you know in the teenagers
sw04285-B_029615-029837 and they usually start that around junior
sw04286-A_000000-000227 [noise] talk about home repairing i understand
sw04286-A_000227-000465 di[d]- have you had any recent experience
sw04286-A_000602-000749 oh okay
sw04286-A_000999-001396 well i'm sure you are mean usually [laughter-are]
sw04286-A_002561-002697 um-hum
sw04286-A_002697-002825 um-hum
sw04286-A_003394-003574 that's right
sw04286-A_003716-005068 well i had an experience uh this summer as a ma[tter]- this past summer hm not this and what happened [laughter] was that my closet rod fell down
sw04286-A_005068-005448 [laughter] and i went into the closet
sw04286-A_005448-005798 and this closet is probably fifteen feet long
sw04286-A_005798-006643 and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word [laughter] oh yes they're very heavy
sw04286-A_006643-006818 and um
sw04286-A_006818-007600 so i i thought now because_1 i'm alone and i said now who am i going to get to do [laughter-this] [laughter-because_1] i sure do[n't]- i wouldn't
sw04286-A_007600-008302 i know one end of the hammer from the other one [laughter-but] that's about it i wouldn't know how to address a nail properly at all
sw04286-A_008302-008858 so i scoured the little paper that we get in the neighborhood and i found uh
sw04286-A_008858-009931 uh a handyman and he said that he was an ex-teacher and i thought well he sounds like the kind of caliber that i would not be too leery of and i called him and
sw04286-A_009931-010943 he did a marvelous job and i and i got to know him pretty well and i said uh he said Catherine he says if you
sw04286-A_010943-012058 this house will fall down but these c[loset]- [laughter-these] [laughter-close] [laughter-rods] [laughter-will] [laughter-not] [laughter-fall] [laughter-down] [laughter] he says that's how good they're in there he says i guarantee this for life [laughter]
sw04286-A_012058-012950 so that really pleased me and he did a m[arvelous]- he did a fantastic job and he also uh replaced my door in my garage uh
sw04286-A_012950-013343 i had been robbed uh the year before and um
sw04286-A_013343-014256 they wanted to charge me six hundred dollars to replace the side door and i thought no you're not i'm not paying six hundred dollars
sw04286-A_014256-014463 American money
sw04286-A_014463-014895 and Ken did it for me for like two hundred and thirty dollars
sw04286-A_014895-015267 and he ga[ve]- and he gave me a solid core door and
sw04286-A_015267-015924 you know i just said i knew that i would find somebody that would do this at a price that was realistic
sw04286-A_015924-016954 six hundred dollars for one single side door that's well he said well that's including labor and i thought okay Charlie i said that [laughter-sounds] [laughter-silly]
sw04286-A_016954-017110 very extreme
sw04286-A_017367-017537 yeah so
sw04286-A_017779-019115 yes it was well see they thought that they could prey on my uh recent loss that i would be in a panic to have this door fixed because that was the door that the intruders
sw04286-A_019115-020115 broke through but but the insurance company had made it so that nobody [laughter-could] [laughter-get] [laughter-in] because they put two by fours over it and nailed it shut
sw04286-A_020249-020490 and uh so i mean
sw04286-A_020490-020966 if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a mac truck to get through the bars
sw04286-A_021426-022231 yeah well they you know the insurance adjuster said if if they are bent on getting your house they'll they'll they'll plow through your brick
sw04286-A_022337-022742 uh he said there's not anything that's going to stop them_1 if they're determined
sw04286-A_024446-024938 oh i see they organize them oh okay
sw04286-A_026059-026279 sure h[ow]- how do you like that
sw04286-A_026279-026463 oh wonderful
sw04286-A_026463-026587 wonderful

sw04286-A_027246-027372 um-hum

sw04286-B_023548-024704 uh i don't know if you're familiar with them up here they call them the California closets they're wire uh uh basically they subdivide your closets into all sorts of little nooks and crannies
sw04286-B_024704-026190 yeah and shelves and so instead of having just a little one rod you have racks and shelves and stuff and you have uh rods but those are bi-level rods there's two sets upper and lower then sort of doubles the hanging space then
sw04286-B_026190-026374 oh they're great
sw04286-B_026374-026655 they're great and um you know they're
sw04286-B_026797-027708 oh yeah oh yeah and instead of having shoes or whatever on the floor and and things like that in your closet they have little shelves on the side that you can
sw04286-B_027708-029002 you can still stack things on they have they have all sorts and uh you know they sell them_1 in our the local home stores here and uh i'm sure that you can pick them_1 up down there but it's a really uh the way they put them_1 together it's really not hard at all to put them
sw04286-B_029002-029971 put them in it takes about an afternoon it was a Sunday afternoon you know and uh you lay it out and they give you little things that you mark uh on your wall tells you how to

sw04287-B_003101-003317 like um well
sw04287-B_003317-003664 i i've discovered it's kind of fun to try to
sw04287-B_003664-003958 take control of the conversation
sw04287-B_003958-004277 uh like you know typically
sw04287-B_004277-004502 they're reading from a script
sw04287-B_004502-004796 so if you start asking questions right away
sw04287-B_004796-005265 or do anything that's a little ou[t]- out of the ordinary they get really thrown
sw04287-B_005265-005649 so like often what i'll do is i'll call up and say
sw04287-B_005649-006648 hi i'm Carla from XYZ company and i'll say [noise] excuse me uh what's your name again and uh act like i'm writing it down and [vocalized-noise] could i have your last name Carla
sw04287-B_006648-007133 and what's the name of your company you know and this by this time they're really shook up and then um
sw04287-B_007133-007613 i ask her uh uh Carla could i have your home telephone number please
sw04287-B_007613-009039 and and they go [noise] well uh no i go well why not i said well i don't give out my home number as well why not i mean you're calling me at home i ought to be able to call you at home and that [laughter-really] [laughter-shakes] [laughter-them_1] [laughter-up] [laughter]
sw04287-B_009039-009257 [laughter]
sw04287-B_010521-011080 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] [laughter-right] or put them_1 on hold yeah
sw04287-B_011080-011513 yeah well another thing you can do is you can pretend that you got them on call waiting
sw04287-B_011513-012110 say i'm on long distance on the [laughter-other] [laughter-line] [laughter] or you can just say no thank you and hang up
sw04287-B_012881-013011 ah
sw04287-B_014849-015328 yeah and those are used as pin numbers a lot like with my bank uh
sw04287-B_015328-016155 uh if i want to move money around over the phone or check my balance or anything the pin number they want is the last four digits of the social security
sw04287-B_016797-016954 really
sw04287-B_016954-017149 i didn't know that huh
sw04287-B_017475-017708 well now where where do they use the stripe
sw04287-B_017899-018211 oh you mean like when a cop pulls you over he runs it through a reader
sw04287-B_018211-018503 [laughter] well that's amazing
sw04287-B_019142-019275 really
sw04287-B_019572-020211 yeah well like the stores can probably develop their own databases but they can't get into the department of motor vehicles
sw04287-B_020211-020340 i'll bet that's it
sw04287-B_021181-021333 yeah because_1 they cou[ld]-
sw04287-B_022334-022590 well then you know about caller ID
sw04287-B_022590-022723 yeah
sw04287-B_022723-023101 hey did you get uh did you get the number for this off of the internet
sw04287-B_023101-023359 oh [laughter-okay]
sw04287-B_023359-023809 yeah most of the uh most of the [laughter-people] i talk to on here are on [laughter-internet]
sw04287-B_023809-024141 yeah did you get it off of uh Telecom Digest
sw04287-B_024255-024466 oh yeah i read that constantly
sw04287-B_024466-025087 yeah i post on there from work under Paul Cook at Proctor and Associates
sw04287-B_025087-025330 and at home as Tad Cook
sw04287-B_025774-026582 oh yeah well i got mine from a friend of mine uh owns a Unix consulting firm and gave me a free account there a few years ago
sw04287-B_026582-026784 so i can just dial it up and
sw04287-B_026908-027106 yeah it's real neat
sw04287-B_027480-028044 oh i'm wi[th]- yeah we're in actually almost exactly the same exchange i'm real near his office
sw04287-B_028044-028683 but it's uh it's it's pretty neat he doesn't have a full UUCP fee but i
sw04287-B_029129-029716 i yeah i'm on this uh moderated one a mailing list uh
sw04287-B_029716-029984 that's [vocalized-noise] uh Telecom
sw04288-A_000000-000017 [noise]
sw04288-A_000136-000268 all right
sw04288-A_000268-000399 um well
sw04288-A_000503-000701 personally with me
sw04288-A_000701-001347 i think we ought to introduce it to the young people but i don't think you can force it upon them because if you force it upon them
sw04288-A_001347-001481 they
sw04288-A_001481-002356 i don't know i it wasn't forced upon me and i i with it beings more my idea it i tend to just stick with it a little bit longer
sw04288-A_003028-003513 no i i just i go through and i i work on like a monthly basis
sw04288-A_003615-003897 i do you know like one weekend a month type thing
sw04288-A_004250-004395 no
sw04288-A_004561-005053 no um well what i do is i work uh i volunteer with the Red Cross
sw04288-A_005053-005284 and i'm a member of their disaster team
sw04288-A_005284-005857 and so i pull call once a month to do disaster work such as single family fires
sw04288-A_005857-006187 and then for national jobs they call me when they need me
sw04288-A_007835-009060 right right if you find your niche um you know and and i worked with a lot of of groups that you know have been working to get young people more involved in what we do and um
sw04288-A_009060-010328 if you can if you can f[ind]- help them to find their niche you know they'll they'll really grow to love it but if you force them_1 in to something that they're not real keen on they'll rebel on it and at least the ones i've seen
sw04288-A_010328-010823 you know and and they a[nd]- they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can
sw04288-A_011625-011798 um-hum
sw04288-A_012731-012872 right
sw04288-A_013004-013138 right
sw04288-A_013138-013439 and something i don't know the Peace Corps
sw04288-A_013439-014114 signing up and going away [laughter] i mean i've got a real good support system with my family and such like that
sw04288-A_014114-014799 you know and and they're the ones that you know i i i think family can make a really big difference in in sticking something out
sw04288-A_014799-015684 you know and so you know as long as you don't pull them_1 away from their family to to to take them_1 off somewhere to do something you know you've got a better chance of making it work
sw04288-A_016088-016223 um-hum
sw04288-A_016907-017100 right
sw04288-A_019388-019585 um-hum um-hum
sw04288-A_019766-019911 well i'd
sw04288-A_019911-020179 i i had never i didn't know that they were
sw04288-A_020179-020561 trying to push through a law or anything to make kids do this
sw04288-A_020561-021981 i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in
sw04288-A_021981-022200 and you could do as little or as much
sw04288-A_022200-023517 and you decided how much involvement that you got which you know a lot of people dropped out but we have a lot we have a large number of people that were it was introduced to that way that has stayed with it and had grown with the organization
sw04288-A_023652-023776 does that make sense
sw04288-A_024598-024792 um-hum
sw04288-A_025992-026143 right
sw04288-A_027400-027634 um-hum um-hum
sw04288-A_027931-028263 right well that's true um
sw04288-A_028263-029339 and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors
sw04288-A_029339-029470 you know
sw04288-A_029470-030016 because otherwise you get into this situation of you're too young to do any of this
sw04288-B_000000-000139 [noise]  tell you what this is later [laughter] 
sw04288-B_002354-002891 yeah i'd say ten years is a good while especially do is yours on a renewal basis is it
sw04288-B_002891-003260 do you have to renew each year or [noise]
sw04288-B_003260-003394 [noise]
sw04288-B_003953-004644 uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commit[ment]-
sw04288-B_005219-005360 oh really
sw04288-B_006230-006591 gosh that must of you must have seen a lot of exciting
sw04288-B_006591-006982 things and i think that would be good for youth because it would
sw04288-B_006982-007126 just
sw04288-B_007126-007813 be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless you're involved in some ki[nd]- kind of
sw04288-B_007813-007941 group
sw04288-B_010812-011489 yeah i could see that happening um i- i would think with enough publicity there's got to be a wide enough variety of
sw04288-B_011489-012084 uh groups that they could volunteer with that they if they didn't find their niche in one group if if they're if
sw04288-B_012084-012788 groups were enough were publicized enough they could just know what they could know what their options were for other groups to try
sw04288-B_012788-013069 and other services to contribute
sw04288-B_014733-014911 oh absolutely
sw04288-B_015664-016435 yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation [noise] even if they were in teams it would be [noise]
sw04288-B_016435-016984 a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that c[ould]- they could draw a support from
sw04288-B_016984-017685 but i understand that a lot of them_1 are uh well i certainly don't know any statistic but
sw04288-B_017685-018075 that a lot are are working individually and um
sw04288-B_018075-018804 i guess that'd be it i[t]- i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not
sw04288-B_018804-018999 incentive but uh
sw04288-B_018999-019206 just
sw04288-B_019206-019477 keeping a focus on the goal
sw04288-B_023706-024022 yeah i think that does make sense um
sw04288-B_024144-024696 you'd have to uh i think ha[ving]- having the individual who's volunteering set their own pace
sw04288-B_024696-024884 for development in the program would
sw04288-B_024884-025862 would be key to just s[taying]- staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a
sw04288-B_025862-026291 you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh
sw04288-B_026291-026697 you know uh but then i think you almost reach a point where
sw04288-B_026697-027080 i[f]- if you pad everything too much it kind of takes away
sw04288-B_027080-027575 the experience i mean the experience of sacrificing i guess is what i'm thinking
sw04288-B_027575-027966 does making of going over[board]- o[verboard]- overboard almost
sw04288-B_029860-030016 yeah
sw04289-A_000000-000928 [noise] all right well i've been to a couple we've uh we just had one recently for my mom's birthday that all the kids got together
sw04289-A_000928-001338 i[n]- in Wyoming Sundance

sw04289-A_004394-004874 several people in town knew what was going on but they never did tell her so [laughter]
sw04289-A_005043-005173 [laughter]
sw04289-A_005173-005625 oh yeah because_1 we figured somebody'd probably tell her sooner or later
sw04289-A_005734-005887 [noise]

sw04289-B_005533-005911 relatively small community it uh it would be pretty easy
sw04289-B_005911-006137 so how many folks were up there
sw04289-B_006687-006816 grandkids
sw04289-B_007910-008094 oh neat

sw04289-B_011807-012265 she just was speechless for about fifteen or twenty minutes
sw04289-B_012265-012626 really caught her off guard it's it's really fun to have a
sw04289-B_012626-012940 have a have that sort of uh
sw04289-B_012940-013179 surprise to family members

sw04289-B_015052-015394 everybody together it's hard now and days actually
sw04289-B_015986-016154 unless

sw04289-B_016782-017495 we ha[ve]- our uh our side of the family really is pretty spread out so we we're [vocalized-noise] we have to uh
sw04289-B_017495-017818 have a reunion maybe every other year

sw04289-B_018009-018247 uh gather uh
sw04289-B_018247-018943 uh at a place just north of Austin which is fairly convenient for everybody we've got folks from El Paso to

sw04289-B_019399-019615 trying to trying to make it

sw04289-B_020685-020977 [laughter]
sw04289-B_021172-021373 yeah one of the uh
sw04289-B_021373-021859 o[ne]- one of the rules is that if you're not at the reunion you have to plan the next one
sw04289-B_021859-022469 so that's that's worked out that that's that that brought a lot of people [laughter]
sw04289-B_022734-022886 well that uh
sw04289-B_022886-024290 it it uh it's been successful so far and you know we [vocalized-noise] after the reunion it's uh it's so funny because you'd say well uh we ought to do this twice a year we had so much fun and it it it's too bad you can't
sw04289-B_024290-025026 you know used to be i guess with uh family reunions where they just sort of came in from the surrounding towns uh
sw04289-B_025026-025368 uh it was a lot easier but now and days we've
sw04289-B_025368-025677 got people scattered all over the country and it's
sw04289-B_025677-025834 that's really tough
sw04289-B_025834-026007 to get folks together
sw04289-B_026007-026198 it's not they don't want to but
sw04289-B_026775-026902 ooh
sw04289-B_027136-027475 what brought you uh down from Wyoming
sw04289-B_027475-027615 oh
sw04289-B_027872-028017 how we uh
sw04289-B_028118-028364 we used to live in Fort Worth actually and
sw04289-B_028364-028856 we lived over by Carswell and i just love watching those planes come by
sw04289-B_028856-029086 it's it's it's really pretty
sw04289-B_029369-029490 yeah
sw04290-A_000000-000783 [noise] i generally uh prefer to do repairs that i am capable of doing myself if it results in significant money savings
sw04290-A_002120-002492 yeah yeah i'm finding that too [laughter]
sw04290-A_003276-003773 that's right you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it
sw04290-A_003773-005111 the last one i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the driver's side i was uh watching too closely on the passenger side i guess
sw04290-A_005111-005414 and i wasn't paying attention closely enough and i ended up
sw04290-A_005414-006193 whacking my uh side view mirror off the side [laughter-of] [laughter-my] car which kind of uh made me kick myself but
sw04290-A_006299-006467 [noise] yeah
sw04290-A_006467-007051 but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer
sw04290-A_007051-007808 who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work
sw04290-A_007808-009013 and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stup[id]- little mirror but it was it it's one of those power ones and it's hea[ted]- heated and
sw04290-A_009013-009172 and all that
sw04290-A_009172-010156 and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured i'd go out that night and put the mirror on but i ended [laughter-up] i had to take the whole door apart uh to
sw04290-A_010156-010897 yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the uh to the rest of the system was way down in the door
sw04290-A_010897-011904 yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together
sw04290-A_011904-012453 and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing
sw04290-A_012453-012880 an[d]- oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh
sw04290-A_012880-013975 no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldn't [laughter-go] [laughter-up] because_1 i had the cable yeah
sw04290-A_014216-015368 and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but uh i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i do[n't]- maybe i'm loosing interest or
sw04290-A_015368-015739 also cars are getting a lot more complex than [laughter-they] [laughter-used] to be
sw04290-A_016144-016289 yeah
sw04290-A_016503-016624 uh-huh
sw04290-A_016860-016987 oh yeah
sw04290-A_017372-017521 yeah
sw04290-A_017521-017703 [laughter]
sw04290-A_017869-018034 yeah
sw04290-A_018612-018794 oh
sw04290-A_019374-019584 oh okay yeah
sw04290-A_019584-019964 so you have to have it up so you have to have the light on [laughter]
sw04290-A_020359-020503 uh-huh
sw04290-A_020626-020752 oh boy
sw04290-A_020752-020834 [laughter]
sw04290-A_021549-021685 yeah
sw04290-A_021819-021994 that's one way to do it
sw04290-A_022139-022250 [laughter]
sw04290-A_022506-023339 now i think my m[echanic]- mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on
sw04290-A_023339-023695 i don't know where that is on my car because i have the flip up type too
sw04290-A_023695-023957 but he did something to make that happen
sw04290-A_024114-024252 yeah
sw04290-A_024252-024587 [laughter] right privileged information
sw04290-A_025093-025286 [laughter-yeah] um-hum
sw04290-A_025455-025590 yep
sw04290-A_026157-026286 that's right
sw04290-A_026795-026932 yep
sw04290-A_027147-027270 [laughter-right]
sw04290-A_028430-028965 yep that's right or unless it's high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it
sw04290-A_028965-029213 but that's not usually easy either
sw04290-A_029526-029683 um-hum
sw04290-A_029683-029839 um-hum
sw04290-B_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04290-B_000802-001012 yeah um
sw04290-B_001129-002197 i always used to do the the you know the the fairly simple repairs uh recently i haven't because uh uh time's become more of a premium for me
sw04290-B_002197-002369 uh-huh
sw04290-B_002369-003515 it's also you know it's also getting to the point where i'm sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this th[is]- it's costing me more money to do it myself then it would for uh i mean that's the reason [laughter] i mean it
sw04290-B_003709-003904 right i
sw04290-B_005732-005939 [laughter]
sw04290-B_006086-006540 yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot [laughter]
sw04290-B_007701-007864 um-hum
sw04290-B_009086-009227 right
sw04290-B_009982-010242 oh because you couldn't acc[ess]- you couldn't access it
sw04290-B_010446-010570 right
sw04290-B_010809-011080 so it ended up being a bitch huh [laughter]
sw04290-B_011829-011952 right
sw04290-B_013617-014423 [laughter] so you had a trip that you had to go to the next day in the middle of winter and your window would not come back up all right
sw04290-B_015662-016673 yeah that that's part of the reason why i have cut down also is that uh same reason uh last thing i did was just replace my uh uh light on uh
sw04290-B_016673-017626 you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it act[ually]- they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that
sw04290-B_017626-018011 uh bu[t]- and it was kind of a a pain
sw04290-B_018011-018731 because you uh y[ou]- you couldn't really fix it without leaving the lights on [laughter]
sw04290-B_018731-019119 because it i didn't ha[ve]- it doesn't have a uh off
sw04290-B_019119-019508 yeah it's one of those um uh flipping type headlights
sw04290-B_019508-019676 and you
sw04290-B_019845-020692 right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and it's li[ke]- not on on some of the some but this one did not
sw04290-B_020692-021930 no but i figured a way to get around it but it was kind of a really stupid way to have to do it is y[ou]- is you get it up in the air and then you turn then you take the battery off and then it then it can't bring it back down [laughter] all right
sw04290-B_021930-022583 right and then but then the lights are still out [laughter] so you're not sitting there going i can't see [laughter]
sw04290-B_023230-023390 right
sw04290-B_023626-023750 um-hum
sw04290-B_023957-024513 right i mean there there probably is but they didn't bother to tell me so [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw04290-B_024513-025150 -[tha]t's great uh then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool
sw04290-B_025150-025263 [vocalized-noise]
sw04290-B_025263-026201 and things like you know oil filters e[very]- every car now it's so tight i[n]- i[n]- in the region where where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter
sw04290-B_026201-026841 though though i guess it's getting a little better again because um what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines
sw04290-B_026841-027968 then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now they're redesigning enough that s[ome]- that to some extent it's it's accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know you'd sit there and say
sw04290-B_027968-028477 there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air
sw04290-B_028885-029042 right y[eah]-
sw04290-B_029183-029946 and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you you know i guess you
sw04291-A_000000-000043 [noise]
sw04291-A_000239-000369 yep
sw04291-A_001813-001968 um-hum
sw04291-A_002617-002756 um-hum
sw04291-A_003871-004047 um-hum
sw04291-A_004361-004716 yeah that's that's uh those are some good thoughts i
sw04291-A_004716-005523 i found for myself that to start off at a junior college in your local community and find
sw04291-A_005523-006527 that way what you do is that you find what topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh a s[ay]-
sw04291-A_006527-007230 a student out of high school they might think that they have some interests but they haven't explored everything so they don't really know
sw04291-A_007230-008139 [noise] so if they go to a junior college and and start taking some general ed[ucation]- classes and things if they look through the catalog and think they find things that they're interested in
sw04291-A_008139-009209 well then they c[an]- they rea[lly]- they can really find what they're interests are and then it plus it's also a lot m[ore]- more inexpensive to do it that way
sw04291-A_009209-009409 a[nd]- be and then
sw04291-A_009409-009837 then then they can choose a college and then they can they can transfer
sw04291-A_009837-010971 yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know it's uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something
sw04291-A_012080-012438 right right
sw04291-A_012608-012761 um-hum
sw04291-A_012942-013085 um-hum
sw04291-A_014637-014760 oh sure
sw04291-A_014864-015004 sure
sw04291-A_015004-015234 yeah yeah
sw04291-A_015234-016186 it just that just helps the decision process when you know what's available because when you're when you're a a kid in sch[ool]- high school and stuff like this is it you're only
sw04291-A_016186-016985 cognizant of sort of your immediate area environment and surroundings so you just don't know what's there you might just you know like go oh wow that's neat you know
sw04291-A_016985-017834 but a[nother]- another thing and this is i think is really important is that the college hype okay
sw04291-A_017834-019018 and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and you know send us this money and we're going to give you these services and things like that
sw04291-A_019018-020155 that isn't so they they're they're they're two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory
sw04291-A_020155-020983 and i they forced you to have a mean plan okay and so you were forced to go to the dining room and
sw04291-A_020983-022233 the food was terrible you were you were treated like a second rate human being and the dormitory was hinged on a Nazi concentration camp
sw04291-A_022233-023285 and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to
sw04291-A_023285-023652 for the parents to go to the college and just
sw04291-A_023652-024953 spend some time and talk to people if they want to send their student to the dorm well go to the talk to some people in there you know talk to the people and get the true information because as i said it's it they're just that's just two different things
sw04291-A_025684-025814 right
sw04291-A_025992-026318 right
sw04291-A_026318-027873 alright but don't fall for the you know the the stu[dent]- the school tour and and all the hype don't fall for it because that's that's not because once you get in there sometimes y[ou]- you make these commitments and you're not able to change them you know c[ommitments]- so
sw04291-A_028878-029063 oh exactly
sw04291-A_029163-029284 exactly
sw04291-A_029535-029660 uh-huh
sw04291-B_000000-000035 [noise]
sw04291-B_000185-000416 okay well
sw04291-B_000416-000763 i guess if i was going to advise a parent on um
sw04291-B_000763-002180 well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um
sw04291-B_002180-002700 and then the second thing i'd probably look at is uh what they can afford
sw04291-B_002700-003480 you know in terms of you know how much money do they have or does the child have to pay are there any scholarships or anything that they could uh
sw04291-B_003480-003947 manage either you know through maybe an open system or maybe from a school itself
sw04291-B_003947-004345 and then kind of go from there you know that's kind of where i'd start
sw04291-B_005362-005485 um-hum
sw04291-B_006052-006183 um-hum
sw04291-B_007185-007315 um-hum
sw04291-B_007853-008194 um-hum yeah
sw04291-B_008504-008657 yeah
sw04291-B_009130-009343 yeah that's true
sw04291-B_010217-010399 um-hum
sw04291-B_010944-012163 um-hum i think those are good points i think one thing i might i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think there's some i think there some kids who who probably don't really know what they want to take
sw04291-B_012163-013536 you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give i[s]- is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are st[udent]- there are students out there who know what they want to take
sw04291-B_013536-013903 and uh i might advise them to jump right in and
sw04291-B_013903-014693 and find you know a good school that th[ey]- you know that has good standing uh in that area you know has a good faculty has a good reputation
sw04291-B_014693-014918 uh that's what i did
sw04291-B_014918-015342 i knew what i wanted and i wa[s]- i was i was e[xactly]- almost exactly right
sw04291-B_016509-016648 um-hum
sw04291-B_016944-017065 um-hum
sw04291-B_017764-017908 um-hum
sw04291-B_018400-018537 um-hum
sw04291-B_018851-018999 yeah
sw04291-B_019164-019309 [laughter]
sw04291-B_019623-019752 um-hum
sw04291-B_020085-020222 um-hum

sw04291-B_022173-022293 okay
sw04291-B_022872-023017 um-hum
sw04291-B_024239-024369 yeah
sw04291-B_024542-024676 um-hum
sw04291-B_024908-025079 yeah i knew uh
sw04291-B_025079-025749 i i think that's a good idea and in general i think it's a good idea to to go to the school i mean once once you've narrowed down
sw04291-B_025749-026394 two or to to two or three or whatever number you know go visit the sch[ool]- school you know both the parents and and the student
sw04291-B_026933-027066 yeah
sw04291-B_027654-027800 um-hum
sw04291-B_027800-028193 yeah i mean and that's the thing you have to sit down and look at the uh
sw04291-B_028193-029202 at the individual needs you know i've you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldn't be
sw04291-B_029202-029611 i had a very good ex[perience]- i was in the dorms for three or fou[r]- out of my four years
sw04291-B_029611-029847 and uh i had a really good dorm experience
sw04292-A_000000-000144 you know about computers
sw04292-A_000330-000475 you are
sw04292-A_000732-000897 oh [laughter]
sw04292-A_000897-002390 well good you can talk about it more than i can i i don't own a computer but um i'm in college right now and uh my boss has an IBM that she has me type letters on a lot and i do a lot of merging with addresses and letters and
sw04292-A_002390-003511 that's basically the only information i have on computers [laughter] i think i'd it would be good for me to have a laptop computer f[or]- for for college
sw04292-A_003511-003846 but um basically my knowledge is limited [laughter]
sw04292-A_004345-004534 uh WordPerfect
sw04292-A_004679-004810 uh-huh
sw04292-A_005730-005861 uh-huh

sw04292-A_011265-012213 and it broke into three pieces [laughter] it comes in three pieces but it separated [laughter] and there was there was a little little piece of it that broke off
sw04292-A_012213-012802 so i panicked called the main office borrowed their's so i could go ahead and print out the the documents

sw04293-A_001504-002086 i remember my parents used to help me with my homework and stuff like that you know make sure that i had
sw04293-A_002086-002458 that i understood what i was trying to study and everything like that
sw04293-A_004014-004882 right [laughter] well we used to take family vacations which i always used to love we'd travel by car to all these different states and
sw04293-A_004882-005628 uh see these you know really nice things and they were not the typical things like Florida or Disneyland or whatever
sw04293-A_005628-006001 was more like Colorado for the mountains or something like that
sw04293-A_007226-008053 yeah exactly i i'm from the midwest myself from Michigan and we'd we'd go as far as like oh
sw04293-A_008053-009299 oh places like Colorado we went to Arkansas very frequently and [vocalized-noise] the the biggest thing was that the family did things together you know we didn't just like separate and go our separate ways when we got there
sw04293-A_009299-009735 we'd always go out and do things and spend time with each other
sw04293-A_011261-011391 yeah
sw04293-A_011599-011914 yep and the kids ended up the losers i think
sw04293-A_012064-012204 um-hum
sw04293-A_012420-012590 its
sw04293-A_013730-013863 right
sw04293-A_014002-015115 they they got in the way they cost money and they g[et]- they're that's the attitude that a lot of people have these days and it's one of the reasons why the kids don't do well in school and don't
sw04293-A_015115-015653 are carrying guns to school and stuff like that because they don't feel like anybody cares
sw04293-A_015653-015829 and uh
sw04293-A_016434-016581 um-hum
sw04293-A_016581-016882 right that's correct
sw04293-A_016882-017362 um ha[ve]- have you uh have you uh worked around kids quite a bit
sw04293-A_017642-017744 [laughter]
sw04293-A_018002-018168 not directly huh
sw04293-A_018168-018280 [laughter]
sw04293-A_018431-019153 yeah i haven't worked i haven't worked around kids too much either i used to live in a building that had a day care down in the basement
sw04293-A_019153-020004 and i'd go down there and play with some of the kids at times and it was really kind of enjoyable to just th[ey]- you know they were younger like two and a half to five
sw04293-A_020004-020956 and um it was enjoyable because they would they li[ked]- just liked being with people i mean it really didn't matter what you did with them as long as you did something with them
sw04293-A_020956-021637 oh you know let's play with the kitchen or or let's let's play with you know read me a book or you know do something
sw04293-A_023092-023256 [laughter]
sw04293-A_023585-023709 you
sw04293-A_023709-024027 [laughter] you speak in simple sentences huh
sw04293-A_024027-024383 [laughter] do you have a boo boo [laughter]
sw04293-A_024383-024883 that doesn't go across very well when you're uh talking to your coworkers [laughter]
sw04293-A_024883-025216 do i have a what [laughter]
sw04293-A_025440-025817 [laughter] i think i'm going to go to the potty now
sw04293-A_025970-026102 [laughter]
sw04293-A_026271-026801 but uh oh well it sounds like you and i have uh similar opinions on this topic
sw04293-A_027652-027977 yeah yep no a[ttention]- no attention span
sw04293-A_027977-028468 and then especially if it can't be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know
sw04293-A_028655-028797 yep
sw04293-A_028955-029443 and uh then you go on to the next set of problems and solve them in a half hour too
sw04293-B_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04293-B_000033-001103 yes uh i think a lot of the problems whether they be in school or in home in discipline has a p[art]- it is rooted in the amount of time parents spend with their kids
sw04293-B_002367-003711 now my parents were the same way uh they they took uh interests in everything that i did not just the things that interested them or when they felt like uh i wanted to spend time which was uh
sw04293-B_003711-004232 uh when they wanted me g[et]- o[ut]- get me out of the door to school in the morning
sw04293-B_004507-004637 [noise]
sw04293-B_005596-005747 um-hum
sw04293-B_005949-007350 yeah that's essentially what we did uh i look i came from the midwest and we went to the neighboring states to uh little known places that i have yet to find anyone else that's ever been to these places
sw04293-B_009267-009396 um-hum
sw04293-B_009686-010545 yeah so i i used to babysit uh the neighbor's kids when i was a lot [laughter-younger] and um
sw04293-B_010545-011595 it was essentially they'd they'd get home from work the parents would they stick the kids in front of the TV set until it was time to go to bed and never did anything as a family together
sw04293-B_011846-012350 yeah they they became uh [laughter-brats] and juvenile delinquents
sw04293-B_012350-012929 the parents just didn't want to really put the time and effort into uh uh
sw04293-B_012929-013752 making them_1 making a family unit it was like they were single but they're they were still a a a single people but uh they had kids
sw04293-B_013858-014045 the kids were just a nuisance
sw04293-B_015594-015744 yeah
sw04293-B_015744-016428 a[nd]- in s[ome]- in a lot of cases uh very few or the only the uh only the wrong people care
sw04293-B_016428-016637 th[e]- the people who should care don't
sw04293-B_016801-017006 [vocalized-noise]
sw04293-B_017465-017653 [noise] people at work
sw04293-B_017653-017840 [laughter]
sw04293-B_017840-017968 uh [laughter]
sw04293-B_017968-018105 [noise]
sw04293-B_018105-018405 n[o]- no not not in recent years
sw04293-B_019072-019206 um-hum
sw04293-B_019921-020062 yeah
sw04293-B_020445-020696 um-hum
sw04293-B_020833-021094 [noise] exactly
sw04293-B_021607-022585 the only problem i had with that and i had i talked to another person who had the same thing when you start actually playing with them you take on the same uh
sw04293-B_022585-023186 uh sometimes you take on the same mentality of like it's [laughter-mine]
sw04293-B_023186-023860 [laughter] and i said wait a minute wait a minute i i'm i'm beyond [laughter-this] and i'm acting just like they are
sw04293-B_023860-024508 [laughter] yeah all the words have one syllable [laughter]
sw04293-B_024742-024864 [laughter-right]
sw04293-B_024864-025024 [laughter]
sw04293-B_025089-025525 [laughter] you know a boo boo an {owie} [laughter]
sw04293-B_025795-026017 [laughter] excuse me [laughter]
sw04293-B_026017-026150 [laughter]
sw04293-B_026150-026543 oh yeah [laughter]
sw04293-B_026763-027699 yeah it's it's it's just uh parents today are it's they want everything if if it can't be done in five minutes don't bother me with it
sw04293-B_027905-028043 um-hum
sw04293-B_028420-029012 right it's the it's the television mentality all problems are created and solved in a half hour
sw04293-B_029368-030007 [noise] yep well things ju[st]- and therefore you have children that um
sw04294-A_000000-000072 [noise]
sw04294-A_000239-001496 um i i have i get frustrated sometimes with our legal system i think it's a bit lenient um giving giving in in most in a lot of cases the the criminal the benefit of the doubt
sw04294-A_001496-002115 or the i guess the criminal you can't say they're criminal yet but they would be the uh the defendant
sw04294-A_002202-002893 the accused right and if you um if you require the jury to be unanimous
sw04294-A_002893-003597 i'm afraid there'd there'd be a lot of there'd be a lot of cases where just a single person is being stubborn and um
sw04294-A_003597-004011 and someone would would get off when they really shouldn't
sw04294-A_008810-009136 wh[at]- what's a political criminal
sw04294-A_009964-010120 like what
sw04294-A_010639-011017 oh i see okay you're calling them political prisoners
sw04294-A_012484-012841 okay yeah i understand i uh
sw04294-A_012841-013734 a[ctually]- actually f[or]- my perception is that most people having having to do with those things you mentioned seems like they tend to get off most of the time
sw04294-A_013734-014093 i don't really have a lot of data but that's my perception
sw04294-A_018359-018589 i certainly agree
sw04294-A_024656-025175 huh what do you think do you think the jury ought to do the sentencing or the judge
sw04294-A_027422-027563 uh-huh
sw04294-A_029617-029907 yeah i d[isagree]- i actually disagree on both of th[em]-
sw04294-B_000000-000030 [noise]
sw04294-B_000030-000245 yeah so what do you think about that
sw04294-B_002045-002253 yeah the accused
sw04294-B_003959-004100 yeah i hear that
sw04294-B_004100-004678 the uh [noise] my problem with the courts and the that systems is just the fact that it's almost completely broken down
sw04294-B_004678-005677 most cases that go on aren't even tried but are plea bargained so that the guy can get off a certain amount of time in exchange for not spending time in the courts
sw04294-B_005677-005855 but the uh
sw04294-B_005855-007260 the worst part is that the jails are being filled with political criminals i mean since nineteen eighty six we've been undergoing a major witch hunt in this country were the question isn't who's hurt anybody but uh is the individual has been engaged in unauthorized behavior
sw04294-B_007260-007750 and we are now ahead of South Africa and Russia in locking up a higher percentage of our citizens
sw04294-B_007750-008879 than any other country on this planet we've beat even beat out the Muslim countries something is major wrong here and uh we can trace it to the right wing witch hunt there isn't any room for the real criminals
sw04294-B_009070-010022 uh it's when uh the government decides that a certain behavior uh shall not be authorized anymore and that anybody who is then caught doing it is guilty of violating the crime
sw04294-B_010022-010262 when in fact nobody has actually been hurt
sw04294-B_010262-010696 oh smoking weed growing marijuana patronizing prostitutes things like that
sw04294-B_010935-011957 well that a[s]- as as opposed to the kind of the more European political prisoners where someone actively uh speaks out and opposes the government i[f]- i[f]- i[f]- if a crime involves no complainant
sw04294-B_011957-012411 then it's the government doing the complaining and that sounds political to me
sw04294-B_013770-013917 um
sw04294-B_014030-015314 it depends on what and who uh the largest number of people who are convicted of various crimes and in jail today are drug crimes that are not accompanied by other crimes
sw04294-B_015314-016060 it's sort of a thing that because someone who is inclined to use some of the nastier drugs will then also go out an[d]- commit other crimes
sw04294-B_016060-016855 that that means that the other crimes are no longer a valid point of contention it's sort of like saying somebody should be able to do all the Coke they want
sw04294-B_016855-017617 but as soon as they violate any other law and actually hurt somebody whether it's stealing money to get the Coke [vocalized-noise] loosing control and beating someone up
sw04294-B_017617-018436 that they should be treated the same way as someone who looses control and beats someone up without being under the influence of chemicals whose they can't use it as an excuse
sw04294-B_018514-019662 but the way that it's come now to the the trials and the judges it's [laughter] i[t's]- it's almost completely manipulated uh in in favor of the government's position
sw04294-B_019662-020828 so uh wh[ile]- i'm willing to sacrifice the danger of having a a few people who are guilty getting off because it's far to easy when the government decides someone did it hey they did it
sw04294-B_020828-021910 and if it and whether the innocence or guilt is true or not becomes irrelevant in fact Texas has gone totally crazy on this Texas has a guy on death row now and
sw04294-B_021910-022425 the con[victed]- convicted of a crime that someone else has come out and admitted to
sw04294-B_022425-023362 and that story has been corroborated but they're still arguing whether that's grounds for uh commuting his sentence or not because guilt or innocence is not a constitutional question
sw04294-B_023362-023932 so Texas could conceivably it's that close execute someone who they know didn't commit the crime
sw04294-B_023932-024134 because of the points of law involved
sw04294-B_024272-024637 so th[ere]- there's a point that's left logic and reason and broken down completely
sw04294-B_025093-025676 oh the jury definitely and uh whether it's unanimous or not i think that it could be uh
sw04294-B_025676-026073 th[ere]- there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um
sw04294-B_026073-027225 i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're going to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty
sw04294-B_027225-027881 [laughter] that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it
sw04294-B_027881-028127 so it's risky real risky
sw04294-B_028127-028473 but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve
sw04294-B_028473-029208 and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're going to be caught then
sw04294-B_029208-029569 for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
sw04295-A_000000-000502 [noise] i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth
sw04295-A_000502-002060 um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste
sw04295-A_002127-002660 it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it
sw04295-A_003287-004346 yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow
sw04295-A_005426-005603 [laughter]
sw04295-A_006557-006688 hum
sw04295-A_008108-008308 yeah absolutely
sw04295-A_008897-009068 yeah absolutely
sw04295-A_009423-009801 and th[at's]- that's a terrible problem as well
sw04295-A_011565-011994 um-hum um-hum
sw04295-A_013238-014171 well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago
sw04295-A_014171-015304 and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out
sw04295-A_015304-016016 to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts
sw04295-A_016016-017419 that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in
sw04295-A_017419-017758 front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there
sw04295-A_018273-018415 uh-huh
sw04295-A_019637-019773 uh no
sw04295-A_021584-022645 yeah i really wish there was some solution to this [vocalized-noise] bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big
sw04295-A_024280-024413 um
sw04295-A_024413-025245 not limiting taxes di[dn't]- hasn't stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now we've got this giant deficit on top of things
sw04295-A_025447-025560 [noise]
sw04295-A_028362-028748 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04295-A_029431-029895 [laughter]
sw04295-B_000000-000091 [noise]
sw04295-B_001560-001690 um-hum
sw04295-B_001934-002286 it's about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isn't it at this moment
sw04295-B_002526-003051 but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and
sw04295-B_003051-003509 not at this point in the business cycle you can't
sw04295-B_004072-004197 yeah
sw04295-B_004197-005589 yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh
sw04295-B_005589-006973 then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixon's first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget we've got well of course part of the problem is that that um
sw04295-B_006973-007448 the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it
sw04295-B_007448-008453 is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit
sw04295-B_008453-009627 i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions w[e]-
sw04295-B_009627-009752 [noise]
sw04295-B_009752-010704 we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law
sw04295-B_010704-011913 which would've made it easier to enforce and would've saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order
sw04295-B_011913-013195 and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i would've said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent i'm going to veto it
sw04295-B_014070-014207 um-hum
sw04295-B_016072-016165 [noise]
sw04295-B_017613-018316 another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at AT&T Gilford Center
sw04295-B_018316-019759 and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy i'm not sure what it's called [vocalized-noise] called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean they're still working with a sixteen bit address space
sw04295-B_019759-020610 and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago
sw04295-B_020610-021626 i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current
sw04295-B_022400-023025 well the Republican solution is to cut taxes
sw04295-B_023025-024458 and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse but uh
sw04295-B_025070-025227 that's right that's right
sw04295-B_025227-026402 um so i- i- i don't know i mean th[ere]- th[ere]- there's only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people don't want programs cut although
sw04295-B_026402-027902 uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully pro[grams]- uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids
sw04295-B_027902-028628 uh i'm a little concerned about that i'm a little concerned [laughter-about] cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them
sw04295-B_028628-029895 but uh there's th[ere]- th[ere]- you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of
sw04296-A_000000-000384 [noise] i think i'm probably somewhere around a five on the scale they gave uh
sw04296-A_000384-001295 um i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone
sw04296-A_001295-002053 but i also think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that
sw04296-A_002053-003036 [noise] although you know certainly our government is is very nice now i[t]- it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some so[me]- citizens to have guns if for some reason
sw04296-A_003036-004052 something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well that's a very farfetched and you know sort of
sw04296-A_004052-004592 you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess it's it's
sw04296-A_004592-005181 i think it's i[t's]- always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since
sw04296-A_005710-005911 yeah i mean i i
sw04296-A_006250-006808 yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you
sw04296-A_007221-007366 yeah i mean most
sw04296-A_008285-008473 yeah i agree completely
sw04296-A_008578-009006 [laughter] yeah yeah yeah
sw04296-A_009722-009895 yeah yeah
sw04296-A_010629-010794 yeah that's a reasonable
sw04296-A_010956-011217 yeah uh i don't think so
sw04296-A_011217-012277 you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think Texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem
sw04296-A_012277-013622 um yeah although i uh one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had uh good enforcement of it it wouldn't matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is [laughter-anyway]
sw04296-A_013622-014607 um and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need uh you know a good method of ensuring that they weren't available there which
sw04296-A_014607-015829 given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that
sw04296-A_015829-015973 yeah
sw04296-A_015973-016568 yeah i mean i don't mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think it's
sw04296-A_016568-017165 something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems
sw04296-A_017165-017434 um yeah
sw04296-A_017434-017677 uh do you do you have any sort of
sw04296-A_017677-018676 you know real real life experience with uh you know either people owning guns or people being uh you know assaulted with uh guns or anything like that
sw04296-A_018676-018818 yeah
sw04296-A_019707-019873 yeah
sw04296-A_020431-020796 yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didn't um
sw04296-A_020796-021708 by the time i came along so we d[idn't]- we didn't have guns in in our house he left them at uh his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever
sw04296-A_021708-022275 but uh i do uh uh another student who i didn't know personally
sw04296-A_022275-023056 at Rice uh but uh it's not that s[mall]- that uh [laughter] large a community uh [laughter-about] a week ago
sw04296-A_023056-023865 uh was shot in the head with a gun [noise] yeah um he was you know going home sort of late at night after studying and uh
sw04296-A_023865-024551 you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because
sw04296-A_024551-025449 they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say [laughter-i'll] i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever
sw04296-A_025449-026861 and uh apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of uh relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but uh apparently the other guy for whatever reason uh shot him anyway
sw04296-A_026861-026980 and uh
sw04296-A_026980-028384 thanks to the fact hi[s]- his motorcycle helmet was made out of Kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but
sw04296-A_028384-028864 um he didn't even have a concussion or or anything like that
sw04296-A_028864-028995 but uh
sw04296-A_028995-029196 so it's kind of scary
sw04296-A_029196-029505 living at um Houston's got a lot of crime
sw04296-B_000000-000071 [noise]
sw04296-B_003721-003839 [laughter]
sw04296-B_005169-005768 well you're right there and uh i just think they should have a little more restriction on who buys guns
sw04296-B_005768-006368 instead of just being able to walk into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period
sw04296-B_006777-006908 exactly
sw04296-B_006908-008342 and i and as far as hunting i'm su[re]- you know this is the same thing and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference
sw04296-B_008342-008940 if your criminal and you need a gun for that night it's g[oing]- you know it's going to make you a little bit mad
sw04296-B_008940-009568 but they should you know they should have some kind of restrictions and i think everybody should have to have a permit
sw04296-B_009568-009814 they don't require everybody to have a permit
sw04296-B_009814-010394 and i think they should if you're going to have a gun you need to to you know register it and and
sw04296-B_010394-010697 have a legitimate reason as to why you have it
sw04296-B_010697-011083 and it i i don't even think they do that in Texas do they
sw04296-B_011083-011304 i don't think so either
sw04296-B_011470-011602 uh-huh
sw04296-B_012170-012320 um-hum
sw04296-B_013170-013295 [noise]
sw04296-B_013548-013694 that's true
sw04296-B_015499-016108 i know it'd just make it it would make it harder for them to get them_1 but they still could but
sw04296-B_016573-016876 but you're right they're always gonna yeah
sw04296-B_017110-017432 hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them_1
sw04296-B_018556-019852 no not not really my my daddy was always a hunter so we always had rifles or shotguns or things around the house but you know he was responsible with those and
sw04296-B_019852-020529 um there was never an accident or anything like that and we've never been robbed or mugged or anything like that
sw04296-B_021474-021628 um-hum
sw04296-B_023275-023412 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_024423-024672 my oh my goodness
sw04296-B_026808-026968 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_027512-027715 oh
sw04296-B_027930-028121 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_028655-028817 oh how frightening
sw04296-B_029109-029267 it really is
sw04296-B_029382-029885 but they you know and they have when my sister when she was going to the University of Texas she ha[d]-
sw04297-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04297-A_001013-001344 oh really so you do you uh don't
sw04297-A_001344-001643 pay attention to uh primary sources
sw04297-A_001643-001820 like TV or
sw04297-A_001927-002062 oh that's interesting
sw04297-A_003064-003217 what about television
sw04297-A_003892-004147 um-hum
sw04297-A_005239-005422 [noise] what about the gulf war
sw04297-A_006245-006369 um
sw04297-A_006537-006683 [noise]
sw04297-A_006683-007715 oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on uh i guess m[ost]- mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper
sw04297-A_007715-008053 i don't have a television so that doesn't help
sw04297-A_008053-008198 [noise]
sw04297-A_008198-008322 um
sw04297-A_008733-009519 i get a daily newspaper and um i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they uh
sw04297-A_009519-010951 the television uh actually is good in uh uh particularly when we're you're talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through uh complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not
sw04297-A_010951-011618 than you do through distilled string of words uh in the newspaper but
sw04297-A_011618-012661 actually for indepth information the news[paper]- newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights and doesn't really go much indepth
sw04297-A_012661-012950 can't really because they don't have the time
sw04297-A_013136-013263 [noise]
sw04297-A_013515-013702 and when i'm on
sw04297-A_013702-014129 airplanes i will use i will read news news magazines
sw04297-A_014129-014493 uh th[at]- my son likes news magazines but uh
sw04297-A_014493-014649 i
sw04297-A_014649-014943 i guess i just never get around to reading them
sw04297-A_014943-015337 it's sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but
sw04297-A_015594-015725 yeah
sw04297-A_015725-015883 yeah
sw04297-A_015883-016040 sort of of
sw04297-A_016175-016238 [noise]
sw04297-A_016238-016420 sort of a relaxing time
sw04297-A_016783-016915 nope
sw04297-A_017015-017139 nope
sw04297-A_017139-017595 [noise] i think radio is in our house more of a source for music
sw04297-A_017595-017751 in quotes
sw04297-A_017751-018059 i don't i don't listen to the radio but my son does
sw04297-A_018178-018355 of course he's thirteen and
sw04297-A_018456-018808 his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music
sw04297-A_019813-020769 oh yeah well when i'm driving in the car that's right sometimes uh well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into uh traffic problems
sw04297-A_020769-021217 so i will tune in to news uh station
sw04297-A_021217-021606 where they gi[ve]- every ten minutes they give traffic information
sw04297-A_021606-021837 and uh
sw04297-A_021837-022224 as a sort of a side effect i get news that way
sw04297-A_023223-024323 well i guess you're right [vocalized-noise] nothing more current than uh uh nothing more current and nothing more news worthy than uh traffic problems if at least not if you're a driver
sw04297-A_024323-024500 [noise]
sw04297-A_024500-024830 so uh i didn't even think about that [laughter]
sw04297-A_024948-025117 [noise]
sw04297-A_025856-026007 um-hum
sw04297-A_026340-027220 well it's a beautiful day here in uh California i'm standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in you're supposed i guess you're supposed to call from different numbers so
sw04297-A_027220-027592 i call from a bunch of uh pay ph[one]- pay phones and whatnot
sw04297-A_027744-028393 so the news the n[ews]- the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday [laughter]
sw04297-A_028393-029286 and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almos[t]- not quite overcast but almost overcast
sw04297-A_029286-029456 and uh
sw04297-A_029456-029706 that's your curr[ent]- current event
sw04297-A_029706-029885 news cast from um
sw04297-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04297-B_000047-001244 um i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didn't realize that it happened yesterday
sw04297-B_001585-001845 no not not on a regular basis
sw04297-B_002023-002780 [laughter-yeah] i uh have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i haven't really
sw04297-B_002780-003115 done it as often as i i intended [laughter]
sw04297-B_003186-004090 um i just don't watch much television i'm usually i usually don't get home -[un]til after the evening news is over and i'm usually in bed by the time the late news starts
sw04297-B_004090-005231 but i um i do watch some TV and and sometimes there'll be if it's some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the TV screen
sw04297-B_005518-005876 um i- i worked with a guy who was in the
sw04297-B_005876-006355 who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to [laughter-date] on what was going on
sw04297-B_006355-006591 how do you keep up on current events
sw04297-B_007980-008093 [laughter]
sw04297-B_008197-008728 do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as you'd like to be
sw04297-B_010926-011052 right
sw04297-B_012287-012403 [noise]
sw04297-B_012867-013289 right right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly
sw04297-B_013372-013528 s[eems]- seems
sw04297-B_014914-015107 right
sw04297-B_015344-015468 [laughter]
sw04297-B_015468-015620 is that what you do
sw04297-B_015620-015842 read your newspaper over breakfast and
sw04297-B_016396-016534 well yeah
sw04297-B_016534-016816 um do you listen to the radio much
sw04297-B_017747-017870 yeah
sw04297-B_018712-018847 [laughter]
sw04297-B_018971-019101 um
sw04297-B_019101-019670 yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just they'll have hourly updates on
sw04297-B_019670-019834 some news caps
sw04297-B_020709-020862 uh-huh
sw04297-B_022198-022346 right
sw04297-B_022346-022975 um i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because
sw04297-B_022975-023283 there i guess they qualify as a current event
sw04297-B_023386-023516 [laughter]
sw04297-B_024282-024426 right
sw04297-B_024757-025023 [laughter] i guess um
sw04297-B_025023-025903 i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one
sw04297-B_027125-027285 oh
sw04298-A_000000-000390 [noise] going to talk about clothing and how we dress for work
sw04298-A_000620-000858 [laughter]

sw04298-A_001147-001294 uh-huh
sw04298-A_001516-002410 well i'm sure that you select different colors everyday and your shoes probably you you ha[ve]- you rotate your shoes around
sw04298-A_002733-002875 okay
sw04298-A_002875-003266 like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants

sw04298-A_004861-005010 uh-huh
sw04298-A_005315-005553 well i mean
sw04298-A_005553-006591 i think men look very nice i i think that they're much better off than women are as far as their clothes go because i think um
sw04298-A_006591-006728 i think
sw04298-A_006728-007524 u[m]- uh and it's true that uh you know men are attracted by what they see and of course the women always um
sw04298-A_007524-008460 either she's pleasing her boyfriend or she's pleasing her mate or she is looking for a a husband
sw04298-A_008460-008725 and she of course
sw04298-A_008725-009063 in the work field if she's single she dresses
sw04298-A_009063-009197 you know
sw04298-A_009197-010485 i don't dress for um i dress for myself i always like to look nice i want to look uh professional and so i i make an a big effort to do that
sw04298-A_011696-012405 uh-huh well and there's some that really are on target and then there's some that are kind of way out in left field
sw04298-A_012405-012849 i don't appreciate the real short dresses and uh
sw04298-A_012849-013479 and then to sit sprawl legged i think that's very offensive and um
sw04298-A_013479-013900 i don't know how they [laughter-feel] [laughter-about] [laughter-it] but it surely doesn't
sw04298-A_013900-014365 uh i th[ink]- i think even the men uh men are offended by that too
sw04298-A_014365-014785 if it's not you know if you're out in public and you're
sw04298-A_014785-015204 you don't watch how you sit i think that's very um [noise]
sw04298-A_015204-015346 inappropriate
sw04298-A_015346-015645 for uh a lady to act like that
sw04298-A_015819-015954 yes i do
sw04298-A_015954-016248 yes i do i work in an office
sw04298-A_017432-017595 uh-huh
sw04298-A_017961-018192 yeah it's pretty
sw04298-A_018192-019594 there it's pretty much like that where i work i was very offended by one of the young ladies who is a secretary and plus she's a mother by what she wore and it looked like she just ha[d]- and she's
sw04298-A_019594-020520 she's very lean you know it's a very lean girl but she really offended me by her dress i mean it was like she forgot to dress
sw04298-A_020520-020863 it was like she was wearing uh um
sw04298-A_020863-020947 [noise]
sw04298-A_020947-021225 golly how do i want to phrase that it looked
sw04298-A_021225-021540 yes a wet suit you know
sw04298-A_021540-022030 i thought that is not the appropriate attire for an office environment
sw04298-A_022225-023480 i yeah because [laughter-everybody] was turning their heads sure enough [laughter] ev[erybody]- you know ev[erybody]- you know you just take a double look and they'll say is that really what she's wearing yeah that's really what she's wearing [laughter]
sw04298-A_023735-024230 oh oh no no no she yeah
sw04298-A_024585-025130 something that you'd wear d[oing]- doing the garden maybe uh no it was
sw04298-A_025210-025488 i thought what is this n[ow]-
sw04298-A_025488-026223 yes it was it was definitely designed if you could see almost every fold of her body
sw04298-A_026223-026362 so
sw04298-A_026362-026796 i thought that was very offensive and i i made a loud remark about it
sw04298-A_026796-027074 in fact i complained to my supervisor about it
sw04298-A_027180-027373 and he agreed
sw04298-A_027373-027731 and she has never worn it since [laughter]
sw04298-A_027731-028186 but i think you have to take some action like that maybe she
sw04298-A_028186-028384 didn't realize
sw04298-A_028384-028513 you know
sw04298-A_028513-028754 how she came across
sw04298-A_028754-029314 some people are oblivious as to what kind of reactions they can cause
sw04298-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04298-B_000356-000720 yes i must admit i'm pretty boring
sw04298-B_000720-001614 i just wear some uh you know old dress pants and a button down shirt just about every [laughter-single] day
sw04298-B_002293-002755 oh the shoes are just about the only thing that doesn't get rotated
sw04298-B_003276-003886 yeah well i just wear blue gray and black blue gray and
sw04298-B_003886-004323 what else is there there's another color dark gray that's it
sw04298-B_004323-004499 [laughter]
sw04298-B_004672-004956 i do once in a while i wear brown but
sw04298-B_005106-005328 what can you do right
sw04298-B_010072-010236 okay y[ou]-
sw04298-B_010236-010390 that that
sw04298-B_010390-011400 that that agrees with what most women tell me is that they dress to please themselves and you know who cares what these other people think
sw04298-B_011400-011826 and you know they have their own idea of what looks good
sw04298-B_012098-012263 [noise]
sw04298-B_013218-013350 [laughter]
sw04298-B_015614-015947 where what sort of a do you work in an office or
sw04298-B_016113-017055 and is it pretty well integrated as far as are you know positions of power or you know where i work
sw04298-B_017163-017547 just about every woman is a secretary
sw04298-B_017547-017766 except for two
sw04298-B_017766-017995 and uh
sw04298-B_017995-018317 there are no male secretaries so
sw04298-B_021046-021390 like sweat suits or something
sw04298-B_022026-022247 you think it was distracting
sw04298-B_022404-022642 [laughter]
sw04298-B_023131-023372 [laughter]
sw04298-B_023372-024751 okay well okay so so she wasn't just floppy and like put on some loose floppy stuff you know cotton [vocalized-noise] uh weave thing not knit something
sw04298-B_024856-024981 yeah
sw04298-B_025313-025616 definitely designed to catch the eye
sw04298-B_026118-026254 [noise]
sw04298-B_027553-027835 [laughter] hey
sw04298-B_029286-029489 yeah we[ll]- [noise]
sw04298-B_029489-029731 r[ight]- or perhaps
sw04299-A_000000-000191 [noise] music yeah
sw04299-A_000191-000432 [laughter] always an interesting topic
sw04299-A_000432-000560 so
sw04299-A_000997-001152 oh wow
sw04299-A_001876-002014 um-hum
sw04299-A_002842-003032 [laughter]
sw04299-A_003276-004446 um uh uh a strong appreciator of it um yeah i i did the typical piano thing back uh when i was young and i even played trombone in band for a number of years
sw04299-A_004446-005296 um but i don't actively uh play anymore i just listen and spend too much money on discs [laughter]
sw04299-A_005544-005666 um-hum
sw04299-A_006445-006646 [laughter]
sw04299-A_007680-007851 um-hum
sw04299-A_008390-008587 [laughter]
sw04299-A_009560-009821 um ye[ah]- yeah that's interesting
sw04299-A_010320-011184 yeah yeah well th[at]- you know technically it shouldn't be difficult to uh modulate the the speed on on a compact disc yeah
sw04299-A_011504-011650 um-hum
sw04299-A_011988-012116 um
sw04299-A_012960-013104 um-hum
sw04299-A_013104-013353 [laughter]
sw04299-A_013353-013495 yeah
sw04299-A_014007-014146 um-hum
sw04299-A_014960-015094 right
sw04299-A_015285-015412 hum-um
sw04299-A_015765-015903 um-hum
sw04299-A_016411-017278 yeah yeah um i guess i'm towards the uh other end of the spectrum um i listen to a lot of uh
sw04299-A_017278-018057 techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music
sw04299-A_018057-018242 um so
sw04299-A_018242-018613 it's kind of the other end of the spectrum for [laughter-you]
sw04299-A_019318-019496 um um-hum
sw04299-A_020019-020174 right right
sw04299-A_020327-020477 right
sw04299-A_020796-020950 um-hum
sw04299-A_020950-021169 yeah they're a very good group
sw04299-A_021341-021478 um-hum
sw04299-A_022323-022636 yeah yeah th[at]- th[at]- [laughter]
sw04299-A_022636-022789 [laughter]
sw04299-A_022789-023745 um that's that's more like Bob Marley and the Whalers um a lot of the other Jamaican uh groups i[t's]- so it's a strongly Jamaican based music
sw04299-A_023745-024234 um but it it's it's interesting too i'm not terribly familiar with with
sw04299-A_024234-025104 reggae itself i know it's influenced a lot of of stuff especially some of the more modern dance stuff they take a lot of the more complicated rhythm structures
sw04299-A_025104-025660 uh from reggae and try to translate that into uh more current hits
sw04299-A_026094-026573 um i've heard of it but i couldn't give you a definition [laughter-of] [laughter-it]
sw04299-A_027757-027914 um-hum
sw04299-A_028079-028323 oh okay okay yeah
sw04299-A_028514-028672 [laughter]
sw04299-A_029353-029523 um-hum
sw04299-A_029523-029760 um-hum yeah
sw04299-B_000000-000131 music huh
sw04299-B_000131-000211 [laughter]
sw04299-B_000355-001139 oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music i've been a part-time disc jockey uh
sw04299-B_001139-001994 work for a a company a little company in Virginia that does uh DJ stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that
sw04299-B_001994-002991 so we've uh [noise] we've had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so it's interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing
sw04299-B_002991-003257 are you involved at all in music or uh
sw04299-B_003526-003705 um-hum hum
sw04299-B_003924-004051 ah
sw04299-B_004349-004487 hum
sw04299-B_004801-004946 yeah
sw04299-B_005054-005242 um-hum [laughter-right]
sw04299-B_005242-005612 yeah it's interesting now there all going to uh CD's now also
sw04299-B_005612-005981 i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh
sw04299-B_005981-006514 in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all a[ll]- still on forty fives
sw04299-B_006514-007274 and uh so they're [noise] they're having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh
sw04299-B_007274-008106 the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers and uh
sw04299-B_008106-009091 so now they're wondering how they're going to do that with CD's [laughter] it's going to be a little tougher i[f]- if it ever goes to CD's it's not it hasn't converted over yet but
sw04299-B_009091-009676 i think the only group of folks that who even use forty fives for music anymore
sw04299-B_009676-010392 yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or CD's
sw04299-B_010678-010810 um-hum
sw04299-B_010911-011033 right
sw04299-B_011033-011570 yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed
sw04299-B_011570-012093 uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors
sw04299-B_012093-012371 so uh and uh [noise]
sw04299-B_012371-013200 i found that uh at least at the things i've {DJed} people like music they can dance to [laughter] if you can get them to dance
sw04299-B_013200-014116 it's kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and
sw04299-B_014116-015034 and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow and the
sw04299-B_015034-015847 we're kind of uh into oldies right now in ou[r]- in our family for some reason we're most of what we listen to is oldies
sw04299-B_015847-016601 so [noise] and yourself you you just uh mostly listen then yeah
sw04299-B_016864-017018 hum hum
sw04299-B_017372-017515 um-hum
sw04299-B_017626-017747 hum
sw04299-B_017994-018143 uh-huh
sw04299-B_018143-018298 huh
sw04299-B_018414-018549 yeah
sw04299-B_018549-019168 i've got uh some albums i've picked up that i've kind of recently gotten interested in it's uh
sw04299-B_019168-019420 the uh African music
sw04299-B_019420-020116 uh there's a a group that Paul Simon has uh featured uh well on his album Graceland
sw04299-B_020116-020403 it's called Lady Smith Black Membazo
sw04299-B_020403-020862 and they're a uh African uh group that sings a cappella
sw04299-B_020862-021054 and um
sw04299-B_021054-021571 um-hum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so that's uh
sw04299-B_021571-021957 it's a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the
sw04299-B_021957-022660 i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is [laughter] i'm not quite sure what reggae is actually
sw04299-B_023030-023151 um-hum
sw04299-B_023316-023503 ah ha uh-huh
sw04299-B_023670-023796 hum
sw04299-B_024310-024443 um-hum
sw04299-B_024786-024923 um-hum
sw04299-B_025547-025920 [noise] you ever hear of a musical from called Zydeco
sw04299-B_025920-026104 i had never heard of it before
sw04299-B_026305-026458 um-hum
sw04299-B_026458-026793 we had uh what were we doing we were {DJing} a uh
sw04299-B_026924-027440 i think it was a company party and they had gotten a request for some of that
sw04299-B_027440-027818 so i did a little research on it it's uh Louisiana
sw04299-B_027818-028152 the uh French uh Cajun music
sw04299-B_028152-028613 yeah and that's that's called Zydeco i'd never heard of that term before
sw04299-B_028613-029094 and uh and i i was able to listen to a few
sw04299-B_029094-029907 tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different [laughter] Cajun type music i'd never actually even heard it be[fore]-
sw04300-A_000000-000030 [noise]
sw04300-A_000030-000499 i actually just got back from uh U2 uh last week

sw04300-A_002995-004184 there there where two million call attempts in in an [laughter-hour] to get the tickets so it was like by the time we got through there i mean we had separate seats seats but we lucked out we got a second and a third row seat
sw04300-A_004184-004498 yeah so we were we were pleased
sw04300-A_005157-006119 well i mean it it's more my fiance's tastes um i go more into Celtic music um Celtic Celtic folk uh
sw04300-A_006119-007132 well Still I Spin and Silly Wizard uh Fair Port Convention you know kind kind of folk rocky kind of stuff but with a strong Celtic element
sw04300-A_007132-008018 uh also Tanger[ine]- you know all sorts of pseudo new {agey} stuff Tangerine Dream and Micheal Field and and anything semi electronic
sw04300-A_008547-009121 well i i like the harmonies and and and and the sounds of of Celtic music and i like like the uh
sw04300-A_009121-010257 um the uh the the uh i'm trying to remember the name of it Tin Whistle the the the variety of s[ongs]- tone you can get out and i find the singers tend to be better less screaming and more more uh
sw04300-A_010257-010982 melodic and attention to phrasing and and hitting the [laughter-notes] rather than you know just belting them out
sw04300-A_010982-011567 uh s[ound]- you sound like you probably are down in the uh country and western belt [laughter-there]
sw04300-A_012250-012408 oh
sw04300-A_013353-014021 well i i find i prefer Delta Blues to like you know what a lot of people think the Blues are because_1 i find you know kind of the more
sw04300-A_014021-014790 the the more uh conventional as where blues i i find kind of repetitive uh and and {unmelodic}
sw04300-A_015450-015579 um-hum
sw04300-A_016058-016183 um
sw04300-A_016883-017040 um-hum
sw04300-A_017040-018014 yeah well it it's a ver[y]- it's a very minimalist form because you've got duh duh duh duh or something like that you've got a very simple base line with
sw04300-A_018014-018652 right yeah i think i was singing like my dog [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04300-A_018652-019836 yeah i mean i i think [vocalized-noise] with that the the quality kind of it it's much more based on you know how much the person can impart i mean i've heard some Blues that it's like you [laughter-you] know did not strike me as
sw04300-A_019836-020480 as anything special because it's like yeah okay you know life's been tough to me too and you know there's just so much you can hear of that
sw04300-A_020776-021606 yeah i i mean you know w[ell]- i've heard some Blues i really liked where you know they're imparting more than just you know i'm yet another guy who got treated bad
sw04300-A_021606-022682 trying think where there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on the actual message being imparted it it cer[tainly]- it certainly you're not listening to it for its lilting melodies
sw04300-A_023472-023610 well uh
sw04300-A_023610-024810 Jazz is is a much more i i i think you've got to be a much more uh spontaneous person to be playing Jazz you know you've got a long time to think about that next verse in uh Blues
sw04300-A_024810-025288 where as in Jazz you know it it just is is moving and um
sw04300-A_025288-025865 right i mean and you've got to be very i mean in many ways Jazz and Celtic if you ever go to like a [vocalized-noise]
sw04300-A_025865-026308 um it's very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh
sw04300-A_026308-027594 uh you know just a a jam session Jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if you're playing a reel or a jig you know that's the basic melody of the jig but people are just going off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played
sw04300-A_027594-027716 [noise]
sw04300-A_027716-027859 right
sw04300-A_028240-028852 um there is to some extent i mean you know [vocalized-noise] there's the basic tune of the jig or the real
sw04300-A_028852-029952 but you know someone will just come in and you know who's going to who's going to you know take lead on this verse who's going to you know it you know i want to uh there's a group called [vocalized-noise] which is an Irish
sw04300-B_000000-000075 [noise]
sw04300-B_000234-000370 yes
sw04300-B_000370-000590 they were in Atlanta uh recently
sw04300-B_000835-001102 how many shows did they play um
sw04300-B_001264-001387 yes
sw04300-B_001854-002307 i see i see so you yo[u]- just caught one show uh
sw04300-B_002594-002747 yes
sw04300-B_002905-003082 oh i see
sw04300-B_003188-003543 really [laughter]
sw04300-B_003822-003948 yes
sw04300-B_004138-004279 how about that
sw04300-B_004409-005245 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-yeah] um uh so so um specifically um uh that's the sort of music you like
sw04300-B_005416-005539 i see
sw04300-B_005746-005969 really that's interesting
sw04300-B_005969-006213 sort of new age stuff
sw04300-B_006627-006816 yeah i i
sw04300-B_006816-006989 i see
sw04300-B_007132-007262 i see
sw04300-B_007723-007883 yes
sw04300-B_007883-008618 is um so the appeal of that music is the [vocalized-noise] quali[ty]- you know the relaxing quality to it
sw04300-B_009528-009673 yes
sw04300-B_010161-010352 melodic uh
sw04300-B_010741-010875 yes
sw04300-B_010875-011113 i see i see
sw04300-B_011252-012636 [vocalized-noise] yeah w[ell]- uh well you see um uh down here there is a big you know there's a huge Country Western influence um particularly what i like um the Blues and uh you know various forms of um
sw04300-B_012636-013359 you know of uh um Delta Blues and uh getting back to um really elemental forms
sw04300-B_014682-015897 well i[t]- um you know i can see that argument but and as far as um the the emotion and the feeling that comes out you know even though it might be uh repetitive um
sw04300-B_015897-017299 the the emotion that comes out of it i really think is a lot of it you know it you know where as the [vocalized-noise] quality of the Celtic music seems you know appealing uh the raw power and you know whether
sw04300-B_017299-017469 uh yeah
sw04300-B_017673-017824 uh uh
sw04300-B_017824-018376 just a one four five progression over and [laughter-over] again yeah
sw04300-B_018376-018746 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] [laughter-yeah]
sw04300-B_020189-020356 right
sw04300-B_020356-020894 so uh so so perhaps the connection with it wasn't there uh
sw04300-B_021020-021156 yes
sw04300-B_021522-021660 yes
sw04300-B_022266-022435 right
sw04300-B_022606-023377 right [laughter] right right um i also like Jazz and um you know how do you think the two um
sw04300-B_023377-023719 you know complement each other do do ri[ght]-
sw04300-B_024280-024459 yes
sw04300-B_024780-024904 right
sw04300-B_025160-025448 and create a flowing in different directions
sw04300-B_025828-025952 yes
sw04300-B_027049-027192 uh-huh
sw04300-B_027534-028388 uh uh never played together and and ne[ver]- uh there uh apparently in the Celtic is there any set form that um
sw04300-B_028777-028933 yes
sw04301-A_000000-000923 [noise] well Allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business
sw04301-A_002364-002490 yeah
sw04301-A_003979-005445 oh i think so too and i think that's ju[st]- about the only thing you can do to to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out [laughter-periodically] limit the terms
sw04301-A_006711-007815 yeah but but the longer they stay i['m]- and i'm [vocalized-noise] assuming we're just talking about Washington politicians i don't know that much about the state government i figure it's pretty rotten too [laughter]
sw04301-A_007815-008288 [laughter] i mean even the city council's are a little weird if you look at Dallas
sw04301-A_008288-008448 [noise]
sw04301-A_008448-008658 yeah but but
sw04301-A_008658-008879 have you been to Washington
sw04301-A_008879-009947 ha[ve]- have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the House and the Senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room full of no one
sw04301-A_009947-010388 and and it i[t]- [noise] their their posturing their
sw04301-A_010388-010941 i don't know i it it's like their not in the real world or something and maybe that's why they have
sw04301-A_010941-011406 have trouble drawing lines as to what's illegal and what's not
sw04301-A_011763-011909 sure
sw04301-A_012383-012520 yeah
sw04301-A_013277-013400 well
sw04301-A_014060-014909 yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to ha[ve]- to live the good life
sw04301-A_014909-015728 i mean if you if you just look at at what goes on in Washington those folks don't live the same way i do anyway [laughter]
sw04301-A_015728-016545 it's almost like they're royalty of some sort and i think that's why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too
sw04301-A_018058-018426 yeah but aren't they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year
sw04301-A_019305-019428 that's mo[re]- uh
sw04301-A_019428-019798 that's a lot more than i make [laughter] huh huh
sw04301-A_019798-020108 well run for office [laughter]
sw04301-A_020318-020984 yeah the[y]- i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them
sw04301-A_021255-022023 oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there's not a balanced budget when they can't even handle their own checking accounts
sw04301-A_022023-022177 i don't know
sw04301-A_022985-023173 no probably not
sw04301-A_023320-023684 that's right i they get caught up i think in the
sw04301-A_023684-024391 the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes
sw04301-A_026446-026623 that's true
sw04301-A_026623-027250 that's true i wonder i wonder if Ross Perot would get elected how he would behave [laughter]
sw04301-A_027250-027358 [laughter]
sw04301-A_027632-027857 i i think he's an honest person
sw04301-A_028072-028588 uh and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else's pockets
sw04301-B_000000-000439 [noise]
sw04301-B_000836-001340 [laughter] i think some of them_1 are dishonest and some of them_1 are probably honest mistakes
sw04301-B_001340-002450 it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account
sw04301-B_002450-003651 but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i think they're under a lot of pressure especially when there's lots of money involved
sw04301-B_003651-004048 and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
sw04301-B_005455-006509 well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can't have them
sw04301-B_006509-006826 which is kind of a hard situation too
sw04301-B_007339-007398 [laughter]
sw04301-B_007650-007928 [laughter]
sw04301-B_008219-008562 [laughter] or a lot weird
sw04301-B_008797-008931 yes
sw04301-B_009852-009984 yeah
sw04301-B_011413-011822 well i mean the other problem is is that they're always up for reelection
sw04301-B_011822-012358 so that they're always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision
sw04301-B_012504-012762 and it it i think that's hard for them
sw04301-B_012762-013152 plus when you you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist
sw04301-B_013344-013756 i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to
sw04301-B_013756-014117 use their influence in not always the most positive ways
sw04301-B_014815-014943 yeah
sw04301-B_015564-015807 no
sw04301-B_016654-017112 uh seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits
sw04301-B_017225-018098 and you know i don't know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen
sw04301-B_018371-019290 well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a Sen[ator]- a a Representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year
sw04301-B_019290-019816 which kind of blew my mind [laughter] ye[s]- yes i'd like to make that much
sw04301-B_019975-020242 uh [laughter-no] [laughter-thanks]
sw04301-B_020993-021369 or rai[se]- they give themselves raises when they're trying to cut government expenses
sw04301-B_021910-022048 yeah
sw04301-B_022048-023011 and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is is is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i'm just convinced you can't legislate common sense
sw04301-B_023011-023287 and that seems to be something that a lot of them_1 are missing
sw04301-B_024349-025079 and i think part of the other problem is is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it
sw04301-B_025079-025328 tend to avoid it
sw04301-B_025328-025615 because of all the negative uh
sw04301-B_025615-026274 feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don't want
sw04301-B_026274-026502 to be associated with that kind of thing
sw04301-B_027190-027750 [laughter] i don't know little nervous about that one [laughter-too]
sw04301-B_027750-028066 yeah i think he definitely is
sw04301-B_028066-028206 i don't
sw04301-B_028617-029577 i'm just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he can't just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out
sw04301-B_029577-029840 and i'm not sure as a President you could ever run it that
sw04302-A_000000-000056 [noise]
sw04302-A_000179-000377 okay i guess they're
sw04302-A_000565-000760 okay um
sw04302-A_000845-001065 i guess i um
sw04302-A_001065-001371 haven't really thought about it for a while i guess um
sw04302-A_001371-001779 the uh job part of the one i have now there is a
sw04302-A_001779-002596 requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh companies they contract with required it and uh
sw04302-A_002596-003116 you know by then it was it was kind of uh um
sw04302-A_003116-003940 you know they didn't explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with
sw04302-A_003940-004322 uh but it's it's not something i
sw04302-A_004322-005123 think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that
sw04302-A_005123-005394 but um it should
sw04302-A_005394-005640 i[t]- it seems like uh
sw04302-A_005772-006052 i guess the employer uh
sw04302-A_006052-006181 is just
sw04302-A_006181-006568 i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
sw04302-A_006734-006935 uh kind of your personal life
sw04302-A_008265-008391 uh-huh
sw04302-A_008776-008891 right
sw04302-A_009276-009416 uh-huh
sw04302-A_010251-010389 yeah
sw04302-A_011211-011354 uh-huh
sw04302-A_013099-013232 um
sw04302-A_013680-013804 right
sw04302-A_014186-014316 right
sw04302-A_014608-014988 yeah i know think most impairments would be ob[vious]- fairly obvious you know but
sw04302-A_015780-015916 right
sw04302-A_016242-016382 um-hum
sw04302-A_017778-017904 uh
sw04302-A_018248-018381 wow
sw04302-A_019267-019395 yeah
sw04302-A_020515-020641 yeah
sw04302-A_021950-022077 um-hum
sw04302-A_022694-023240 yeah [noise] seems like it's a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would
sw04302-A_023240-023429 done it and they they
sw04302-A_023429-023655 you know the climate would be different then
sw04302-A_025176-025296 uh-huh
sw04302-A_025703-025842 right
sw04302-A_026756-026889 yeah
sw04302-A_027481-027774 uh-huh yeah
sw04302-A_027774-028235 yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um
sw04302-A_028364-028823 i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know
sw04302-A_028823-029152 it might be that they the carr[ier]- the carrier they're using has a
sw04302-A_029152-029620 has higher rates or something like that so there's there's probably an economic argument
sw04302-A_029620-029744 [vocalized-noise]
sw04302-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04302-B_000232-000383 okay
sw04302-B_000383-000691 so uh you go first yeah
sw04302-B_003881-004031 uh-huh
sw04302-B_004031-004181 [noise]
sw04302-B_005031-005144 um-hum
sw04302-B_006864-008453 right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and
sw04302-B_008453-009453 um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect some[thing]- an employee's performance
sw04302-B_009453-010299 there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day
sw04302-B_010299-010746 and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also
sw04302-B_010746-011357 you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i me[an]- i i
sw04302-B_011357-012164 uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically
sw04302-B_012164-013126 um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it
sw04302-B_013126-013939 but the thing is it's not it's not my company's business what i do on the weekends or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover
sw04302-B_013939-014744 then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well
sw04302-B_014888-015665 yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then i'm fine the next morning
sw04302-B_015665-015840 it's none of their business
sw04302-B_015840-016567 you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever um
sw04302-B_016567-017797 and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails
sw04302-B_017797-018312 that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous
sw04302-B_018312-019576 you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
sw04302-B_019576-019674 um
sw04302-B_019674-020555 also especially it's unfair when the companies don't offer some sort of treatment program also it you know it's like oh we find you with drugs so huh you're gone
sw04302-B_020555-020712 get out of here
sw04302-B_020712-022079 um luckily my company is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything i[t]- it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um
sw04302-B_022079-022551 and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees um
sw04302-B_022551-022740 but i you know i
sw04302-B_022980-023200 yeah yeah
sw04302-B_023350-023575 right yeah it it'll be
sw04302-B_023575-023697 yeah
sw04302-B_023697-024014 and i i you know i don't think the companies have any
sw04302-B_024014-024284 cause to do that sort of thing
sw04302-B_024284-024745 unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in
sw04302-B_024745-025375 obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here
sw04302-B_025375-025886 then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's
sw04302-B_025886-026807 you know th[ere]- th[ere]- there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance
sw04302-B_026807-027685 you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense
sw04302-B_027685-027931 so it's
sw04302-B_027931-028083 yeah
sw04302-B_028769-029028 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04302-B_029335-029532 right well
sw04302-B_029532-029869 i[n]- i[n]- i[n]- in that case charge the employees extra
sw04303-A_000000-000408 [noise] well um as far as the as far as spending goes
sw04303-A_000408-001673 the way um the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are
sw04303-A_001673-002733 because_1 i know the article i read stated that Texas had um what was it like eleven mi[llion]- not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand
sw04303-A_002733-003263 offered to it or more than that and it didn't take advantage of all the money that it was offered
sw04303-A_003263-003732 because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in AIDS cases
sw04303-A_003732-004075 and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided
sw04303-A_004544-005486 well there's w[ell]- well we have we have our o[wn]- you know that we have i guess a fair share um and it's it's
sw04303-A_005486-005903 spreading outside of of the homosexual community
sw04303-A_007200-007332 uh-huh
sw04303-A_008852-009172 um-hum um-hum um-hum
sw04303-A_009731-009880 um-hum
sw04303-A_010240-010441 well also because it's so new
sw04303-A_010441-011049 and can[cer]- and cancer and such doesn't spread as readily to other people as it does as AIDS does
sw04303-A_012041-012167 um-hum
sw04303-A_012284-012420 um-hum
sw04303-A_013955-014094 [laughter]
sw04303-A_015444-015594 um-hum
sw04303-A_015594-015745 um-hum
sw04303-A_016992-017131 um-hum
sw04303-A_017510-017645 um-hum
sw04303-A_019794-019927 that's true
sw04303-A_019927-020132 i hadn't i hadn't thought about that
sw04303-A_022156-022282 um-hum
sw04303-A_023064-023497 well um i i think
sw04303-A_023497-024743 a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a a an a totally new experience we haven't come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where we've come across a disease that has spread this rapidly
sw04303-A_024743-025706 um and that we've you know is is changing i know just in the last three months the CDC has come back and redefined AIDS
sw04303-A_025706-026299 you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding
sw04303-A_026299-027401 and we kee[p]- you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now
sw04303-A_027401-027629 yeah you know
sw04303-A_028023-028170 um-hum
sw04303-A_029444-029572 um-hum
sw04303-B_000000-000063 [noise]
sw04303-B_002707-002838 um-hum
sw04303-B_003210-003331 um-hum
sw04303-B_004033-004546 i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas
sw04303-B_005823-005979 interesting
sw04303-B_005979-007326 yeah and Atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the Southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the Centers for Disease Control is located here
sw04303-B_007326-007843 uh my feeling on the funding issue is uh
sw04303-B_007843-008496 uh p[roportion]- in proportion to the number of people who are dying of AIDS
sw04303-B_008496-009134 uh compared to uh other diseases like cancer and heart disease
sw04303-B_009134-009796 we're spending many many times more on AIDS research than we are for these other diseases
sw04303-B_009796-010366 and i think a lot of it's just due to political clout and pressure
sw04303-B_010366-010570 yeah
sw04303-B_011128-012346 that well yes that's true but also uh we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways AIDS is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes
sw04303-B_012346-013786 i do think that uh part of the reason that we haven't made as much progress in AIDS research and the reason we're spending so much money on it is that it's almost all of the research is in the hands of the government
sw04303-B_013786-014532 and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh
sw04303-B_014532-015703 if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside
sw04303-B_015703-016576 and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find uh
sw04303-B_016576-017591 a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that we'd find a cure really quick
sw04303-B_017591-018228 uh but as it is it's just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats
sw04303-B_018228-018574 uh and it's real disappointing uh
sw04303-B_018574-019749 you know so many of the other uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance
sw04303-B_020194-020320 uh
sw04303-B_020320-021207 course you know i'm a big advocate of the free market anyway and uh it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in
sw04303-B_021207-021408 just just goes to pot
sw04303-B_021408-021609 uh but
sw04303-B_021747-021871 uh i
sw04303-B_021871-022192 uh i do want there to be a cure
sw04303-B_022192-022337 uh
sw04303-B_022337-022477 uh
sw04303-B_022477-023097 but like so many other things i think the w[ay]- just the way that we're going about it is not the best way
sw04303-B_025654-025804 sure
sw04303-B_027334-027533 uh it's a long time
sw04303-B_027533-028263 and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are HIV positive but who never get the disease
sw04303-B_028263-029295 and it seems to me that it's it's likely that there's some other uh it's not just the virus that causes it but it's something else in your body that the virus triggers
sw04303-B_029295-029824 uh that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other trigg[er]-
sw04304-A_000000-000195 [noise] well um [noise]
sw04304-A_000195-000600 i guess the first question is uh what um
sw04304-A_000600-000868 wh[at]- do do you have any children at all to begin with
sw04304-A_002330-002484 pediatrics
sw04304-A_002953-003127 i
sw04304-A_003716-004100 oh are you um what are you a nurse are you a doctor uh
sw04304-A_004100-004319 is an attendant a physicians assistant
sw04304-A_004319-004484 i see so
sw04304-A_004484-005228 i've no well i mean there's all kinds of things i haven't heard of so i i haven't heard of that no not particularly what what do you do exactly
sw04304-A_005973-006094 yeah
sw04304-A_008163-008381 um-hum hum hum
sw04304-A_008381-008552 oh boy
sw04304-A_008939-009368 no i do not none that i'm aware of anyway as they say um
sw04304-A_009519-010233 [noise] no i uh no i do not have have any children i'm very i'm mostly happily single
sw04304-A_010233-010379 uh
sw04304-A_010691-010934 yeah i i it is i i um
sw04304-A_010934-011287 uh i don't know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject it's kind of
sw04304-A_011287-012119 for me this particular question is is is uh reminiscent of uh answer yes or no have you stopped beating your wife
sw04304-A_012119-013397 uh um it pre supposes something that isn't necessarily that isn't necessarily true first of all that you think that child care should be done by other people besides the people having the kids
sw04304-A_013397-014075 but um i'm i'm a little li[ke]- i don't know i've i've got my own views on that i
sw04304-A_014075-014298 well uh
sw04304-A_014620-014796 hey there you go
sw04304-A_014796-015382 um i don't know i i tend to think that child care is kind of overused i think there's a
sw04304-A_015382-016566 kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over
sw04304-A_016566-017030 over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense
sw04304-A_017161-018162 that's the reason one of the reasons i think that schools are doing so badly is so many people look at them as a just a just a tax payer financed babysitting service
sw04304-A_018162-018491 you know but anyway that's just me [laughter]
sw04304-A_020447-020573 [noise]
sw04304-A_021380-021520 yeah
sw04304-A_022197-022431 there's a good phrase [laughter]
sw04304-A_023730-023908 um-hum [noise]
sw04304-A_024245-024511 yeah oh yeah i i understand that
sw04304-A_025499-026128 if somebody would at least [vocalized-noise] i don't know it's it's rough and i think that there's a
sw04304-A_026128-026343 well there a
sw04304-A_026343-026689 giving an example my girlfriend's uh sister
sw04304-A_026689-027043 is um marry married a uh
sw04304-A_027043-027732 married a uh psychologist and where they're living he they can they can afford for her not to work
sw04304-A_027732-028397 which she has not been doing since they since they've had uh children
sw04304-A_028397-029014 and especially i i think it would be ultimate really impossible because she just had twins not very long ago
sw04304-A_029014-029206 and uh
sw04304-A_029206-029490 and uh they
sw04304-A_029490-029994 [noise] you know they tell me that there's they get together and
sw04304-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04304-B_000844-001521 well i work with children um i don't have any right now uh myself um
sw04304-B_001521-002393 but we definitely do want to have um children and i work in the medical field so i work with children during the day quite a bit
sw04304-B_002393-002999 um well i have worked in family practice which in large part was pediatrics
sw04304-B_002999-003212 so i'm [noise]
sw04304-B_003212-003420 well aware of
sw04304-B_003420-003726 child care problems and needs
sw04304-B_003989-004232 i'm a physician assistant
sw04304-B_004232-004377 um-hum
sw04304-B_004377-004546 have you ever heard of that
sw04304-B_005007-005134 hum
sw04304-B_005134-005518 um well we're train to diagnose and prescribe and
sw04304-B_005518-006074 um in some states anyway their prescribing laws are different and
sw04304-B_006074-006466 in the particular job that i recently left um
sw04304-B_006466-006665 i was functioning
sw04304-B_006665-006955 as a family practitioner and
sw04304-B_006955-007386 just seeing patients of all varieties whatever you'd see in normal family practice
sw04304-B_007386-007665 pretty much what i did and i saw kids a lot
sw04304-B_007665-008293 they liked to see me because_1 i wasn't an intimidating man doctor i guess [laughter]
sw04304-B_008293-008601 so they appreciated that
sw04304-B_008601-008755 but
sw04304-B_008755-008975 so do you have children
sw04304-B_010160-010827 hm [laughter] none that you're [laughter-aware] well that's our topic right [laughter]
sw04304-B_012071-012329 [laughter]
sw04304-B_013355-013490 um-hum
sw04304-B_013919-014186 well what are your views
sw04304-B_014186-014443 you can tell me i've
sw04304-B_014443-014855 doesn't matter if i agree or not oh [laughter]
sw04304-B_015303-015470 kind of what
sw04304-B_016630-016750 um-hum
sw04304-B_017019-017141 yeah
sw04304-B_018043-018175 um-hum
sw04304-B_018464-018855 well i agree with you there i i guess [vocalized-noise]
sw04304-B_018855-018999 um
sw04304-B_018999-019281 i- i suppose
sw04304-B_019281-020490 you know you could call me a career woman but i i do feel that i want to be at home with my kids mainly because i see that as such an important thing um
sw04304-B_020490-020658 [noise] that
sw04304-B_020658-020959 also i know of what a job takes out of me
sw04304-B_020959-021549 and i wouldn't have anything left over for my kids and i wouldn't want to do that to [laughter-myself] you know
sw04304-B_021549-022193 i mean these are human beings that we're trying to raise and help them be constructive members of society
sw04304-B_022311-022489 so [laughter]
sw04304-B_022489-023354 so i i'm with you there on the other hand i have a lot friends who are mothers and work full time in their careers and i wouldn't
sw04304-B_023354-023547 you know i
sw04304-B_023547-024277 their kids are darling too and i i would hate to give them the impression that i ju[dge]- am judging them
sw04304-B_024435-025171 yeah but on the other hand there some that are sacrificing their kids for the sake of their jobs and you know
sw04304-B_025171-025483 i'm sure their kids would be much better served if
sw04304-B_025626-025821 yeah
sw04304-B_026664-026794 um-hum
sw04304-B_027690-027902 um-hum
sw04304-B_028880-029017 oh
sw04304-B_029017-029259 yeah there's no way
sw04305-A_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04305-A_001017-001147 uh-huh
sw04305-A_001726-002511 alright and um so um in other words y[our]- your bread and butter comes from the federal government
sw04305-A_002511-003083 right so your your uh your life sort of follows it's [vocalized-noise] flow
sw04305-A_003083-003578 so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they
sw04305-A_004068-004234 uh-huh
sw04305-A_007208-007400 sure i see what you're saying
sw04305-A_008508-008661 um-hum
sw04305-A_008904-009166 and that's just recently been taken away from you
sw04305-A_010364-010495 um
sw04305-A_011693-011881 development yeah
sw04305-A_012357-012949 well um you say now you say you get your health benefits is this a one hundred percent coverage
sw04305-A_013253-013391 yeah
sw04305-A_014770-014974 ability to choose
sw04305-A_015324-015465 um-hum
sw04305-A_015895-016032 um-hum
sw04305-A_016762-016887 um-hum
sw04305-A_018038-018204 um-hum
sw04305-A_018204-018368 sure
sw04305-A_018561-018675 [noise]
sw04305-A_020140-020818 well that's it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isn't done at the i guess at the federal level or
sw04305-A_020818-021725 or something i don't know about this but it's uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the Washington Area
sw04305-A_021725-022904 and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh l[aw]- the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money
sw04305-A_022904-023717 and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um
sw04305-A_023717-024837 the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were
sw04305-A_024837-025119 party to with with uh full dental and
sw04305-A_025119-026330 uh you know optical s[tuff]- stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the HMO idea
sw04305-A_026330-026987 appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out
sw04305-A_026987-028104 uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them i've change jobs now but this the same HMO is still available in my current position and and um
sw04305-A_028104-029196 it's it's uh i the interesting thing they've done some interesting things with the HMO's in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh
sw04305-A_029196-029840 one of them that's run by Prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the Washington Area
sw04305-B_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04305-B_000036-001056 i work for one of the defense contractors out here [laughter] actually it's it's not a defense contractor it's uh a federally funded research and development center
sw04305-B_001056-001742 [laughter] kind of like the Mitre Corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the Air Force in terms of satellites
sw04305-B_002323-002639 th[e]- the government yes uh
sw04305-B_003005-003146 that's correct
sw04305-B_003475-004534 uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um
sw04305-B_004534-005359 i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um
sw04305-B_005359-006569 three weeks of vacation to start normally in California when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between Christmas and New Year's so you end up
sw04305-B_006569-007284 in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way
sw04305-B_007284-008100 uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between Christmas and New Year's
sw04305-B_008100-008550 uh the idea is that you've got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it
sw04305-B_008550-008923 so that was a big plus benefit for this company
sw04305-B_009064-010465 uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between Christmas and New Year's or take a week of no pay
sw04305-B_010465-011640 uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Year's i don't believe that this is a long term
sw04305-B_011640-012396 solution that they're going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more
sw04305-B_012725-012867 uh
sw04305-B_012867-013295 uh-huh no i don't think any of unless of course you go with an HMO
sw04305-B_013295-014746 uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses you're on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an HMO though you lose the
sw04305-B_014746-015679 um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the
sw04305-B_015679-016816 um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent
sw04305-B_016816-017597 so that that [noise] i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um
sw04305-B_017597-018571 an HMO type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for RCA back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything
sw04305-B_018571-020157 but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases
sw04305-B_020552-020681 right
sw04305-B_020681-020912 yeah
sw04305-B_021659-021815 uh-huh
sw04305-B_022730-022942 um-hum
sw04305-B_023436-023577 uh-huh
sw04305-B_024869-025015 huh
sw04305-B_025251-025529 uh-huh right
sw04305-B_025886-026038 wow
sw04305-B_027616-027743 hum
sw04306-A_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04306-A_000054-000349 so what do you think of the current jury system
sw04306-A_001593-002261 yeah def[inite]- definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and as much on the defendant's side as possible
sw04306-A_002261-002588 make sure you're not getting into a police state or anything close to it
sw04306-A_004242-004515 uh it just said trial by jury it didn't say either
sw04306-A_005575-006235 yeah i i think there's a lot more shades of gray that are possible and acceptable in civil trials than in criminal trials
sw04306-A_006235-006676 criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didn't it happened
sw04306-A_006676-007595 where in the civil trial there's a more wider range of you know whether this contract was satisfied fully satisfied partly satisfied
sw04306-A_007595-007741 or so on
sw04306-A_008512-009217 so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be
sw04306-A_009217-009406 i think you really want
sw04306-A_009406-010015 another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for
sw04306-A_010015-010556 and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be
sw04306-A_011178-011308 yeah
sw04306-A_012422-012879 right that get overturned or changed on the first appeal
sw04306-A_012879-013607 where as if they came up with a more reasonable one the first time through maybe you wouldn't need to tie up the system with all these appeals
sw04306-A_016021-016209 yeah well th[e]- th[e]- the
sw04306-A_016896-017024 right
sw04306-A_017546-017737 and i also think ye[ah]-
sw04306-A_017737-018526 on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards should really go more towards let's say the government and supporting the court system
sw04306-A_018526-019289 there's no reason an individual person should get the punitive damages i think that's more of
sw04306-A_019289-019646 you know i[t]- it's something that doesn't really
sw04306-A_019646-020139 you know the person is already being compensated for his losses and injuries
sw04306-A_020139-020750 the punitive damages are more of a slap on the wrist of the person doing or the corporation doing the injury
sw04306-A_020750-021270 and having that go to the person who does the suing doesn't quite make sense
sw04306-A_022443-022586 right
sw04306-A_024473-024905 no i think five million dollars would definitely cut into the executive bonuses of GM
sw04306-A_025718-025933 yes yes [laughter]
sw04306-A_025933-026290 and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the
sw04306-A_026562-026952 you know the other thing i guess on the topic that i'd bring up is um
sw04306-A_026952-027457 the insanity defensives i don't never quite liked that temporary insanity
sw04306-A_029728-029853 right
sw04306-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04306-B_000277-000715 oh i think basically it works okay the uh
sw04306-B_000715-001010 i do think that we need to have
sw04306-B_001010-001571 unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes
sw04306-B_002209-002386 yeah absolutely
sw04306-B_002551-002736 right absolutely
sw04306-B_002910-003186 the uh i think that
sw04306-B_003186-003696 when they have unanimous verdicts in some civil trials i think that's okay but
sw04306-B_003696-003834 uh
sw04306-B_003834-004260 i'm not sure if they said we're supposed to just talk about civil or criminal or both
sw04306-B_004500-004726 okay well for civil
sw04306-B_004726-005384 i think a i think in a lot of cases in civil trials you can have a i think ten to two
sw04306-B_005384-005562 is acceptable
sw04306-B_007731-007961 right yeah there's a lot more
sw04306-B_007961-008576 variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it it's
sw04306-B_010502-011248 i agree and i agree that the jury in those kinds of civil trials can even apportion the liability if it's a liability type of thing
sw04306-B_011248-012502 that it's forty percent this guy sixty the other or whatever but uh in civil trials juries have come up with some really ridiculous awards
sw04306-B_012836-012968 right
sw04306-B_013569-014347 right i agree and i think that uh certainly were i in a paralyzed or something i'd want eighty three zillion dollars
sw04306-B_014347-014703 but uh i think rationally
sw04306-B_014703-015751 eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what i'd really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of
sw04306-B_015751-015879 me
sw04306-B_015879-016068 for the rest of my life
sw04306-B_016068-016565 wish that i had proper care and medical treatment but giving me an extra
sw04306-B_016565-016988 million and millions of dollars that i couldn't do a damn thing with anyway
sw04306-B_016988-017749 and uh wouldn't really help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half
sw04306-B_019019-019147 right
sw04306-B_020088-020257 yeah
sw04306-B_021213-021614 right also punitive damages in general i mean if
sw04306-B_021614-021753 there's
sw04306-B_021753-022499 if i'm hurt in a car accident and there's punitive damages of five million dollars against you i'd probably never collect it
sw04306-B_022499-023367 and if it's because your car was bad and it's five million dollars against General Motors that's probably small change to them
sw04306-B_023367-024541 and it's not really punitive against either one because General Motors five million is nothing and to you since it's uncollectable it doesn't make much difference anyway
sw04306-B_024908-025834 uh [laughter] i don't [laughter-know] it's a good question i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but
sw04306-B_025834-026011 the uh
sw04306-B_027397-027939 well i like what some states have including Colorado
sw04306-B_027939-028576 and Idaho the wording is something like on the insanity it's
sw04306-B_028576-029013 instead of not guilty because you're insane
sw04306-B_029013-029539 so they send you to the mental hospital it's guilty
sw04306-B_029539-029853 and insane something like
sw04307-A_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04307-A_000069-000401 yeah um my opinion uh
sw04307-A_000401-001128 is not quite well enough formulated for for real debate but above all i r[eally]- really believe
sw04307-A_001128-002250 that uh first of all people are innocent until proven guilty and secondly that th[ere]- in some sense there's a sort of sanctity of the body issue in that i don't
sw04307-A_002250-003064 really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent
sw04307-A_003064-004253 so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my con[viction]- conviction that i i do not believe that uh spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be
sw04307-A_004253-004680 you know mandated however they could be done with the person's consent
sw04307-A_005480-005604 um
sw04307-A_005604-005766 [noise]
sw04307-A_006222-006363 [laughter]
sw04307-A_007003-007147 right
sw04307-A_008689-008787 [noise]
sw04307-A_008954-009692 okay [noise] well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well
sw04307-A_009692-010307 and uh in the case of driving it's not a i[t]- it's a privilege to drive
sw04307-A_010307-011195 and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know
sw04307-A_011195-011391 [laughter-yeah]
sw04307-A_011391-011883 right in that case because it c[learly]- clearly endangers someone in that case
sw04307-A_014308-014438 um-hum
sw04307-A_015457-016340 [noise] oh i see you're you're a much more baser a[t]- a[t]- at the issue of uh of the drug issue than i am apparently uh
sw04307-A_021885-022075 ah [laughter-wow]
sw04307-A_022732-023897 well uh as as far as i- i'm not sure you you sort of seem to be kind of saying that you have the right to uh pursue any kind of substance that you'd like except for in certain
sw04307-A_023897-024208 circumstances like driving is that what you're trying to say
sw04307-A_025155-025285 [noise]
sw04307-A_025285-025461 right
sw04307-A_025789-026811 well not having alcohol t[obacco]- prohibition and and uh tobacco prohibition uh i think those are more historical artifact of uh
sw04307-A_026811-027142 the link between the business and the government though because there
sw04307-A_027280-027408 yeah
sw04307-A_027862-028159 [laughter] well hey they were successful
sw04307-A_028606-029150 well i'm i guess we should get back to to the the drug testing issue
sw04307-A_029150-029885 yeah um well i'm trying to think of of more coherent thought it's kind of difficult to have a debate
sw04307-B_000000-000198 [noise] drug testing hey
sw04307-B_004641-005696 i'm a little bit more uh against it than that because i see this as an absolute parallel to the McCarthy witch hunts when anybody who held
sw04307-B_005696-006308 liberal opinions or supported civil rights was considered an evil satanic agent of Moscow
sw04307-B_006308-006763 quite often i m[ean]- there's the legitimate concern of people who are too stupid
sw04307-B_006763-007220 not to use chemicals that im[pair]- can impair their behavior in a job
sw04307-B_007220-007837 where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or uh driving buses
sw04307-B_007837-009049 and also uh the uh strictures against driving uh uni[mpaired]- while impaired should apply to any chemical of any kind whether the government has authorized the use of that chemical or not
sw04307-B_011104-011762 and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense but this is not the issue here
sw04307-B_011762-012916 it's not the issue in question though because what the government is trying to do is to truly impose thought control they are saying there are things you cannot do to your mind and body because we have not authorized to do it
sw04307-B_012916-013143 and further more if we think that you are
sw04307-B_013143-013854 uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior
sw04307-B_013854-014926 now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask
sw04307-B_014926-015512 they shouldn't have the right to prohibit these chemicals what they should have the right to prohibit is misuse of anything
sw04307-B_016209-017027 yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent
sw04307-B_017027-018494 of the tests and the positive tests and the arrests contain concern marijuana the only commonly used drug that has no traceable deaths from overuse none even aspirin kills thirty two people a year
sw04307-B_018494-019812 and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse uh general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that
sw04307-B_019812-020563 and so on top of that goes the whole Republican drug testing uh intervention and control of your body attitude
sw04307-B_020563-021898 an interesting side note of this is the Motorola company lost eighteen months of development on the oh four oh chip because they instituted drug testing and the entire development team for that chip left the company
sw04307-B_022047-022707 and that's why it took this long for the oh four oh to get out they scuttled their own boat and cost themselves millions of dollars for that
sw04307-B_024149-025107 i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at
sw04307-B_025107-025759 not the uh not the direct cause of it it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition
sw04307-B_027033-027327 yeah that's true too especially with tobacco
sw04307-B_027327-027929 and alcohol they did try to ban it they failed utterly they failed miserably and led to the creation of the modern day mafia
sw04307-B_027929-028534 and that's pretty much what's happ[en]- that's pretty much what's happened with other with the the current prohibition
sw04307-B_029022-029294 to tell yeah that we [laughter-are] getting a stray
sw04308-A_000000-000832 [noise] well this is this is a good topic for me uh it [laughter-is] my mother and i bough[t]- well my mother bought a house um
sw04308-A_000832-001970 -[a]bout two or three years ago and it was about to be repossessed and the people that lived in this house were real filthy they had animals and they smoked and it was just a real dirty house
sw04308-A_001970-002544 so we had to redo everything on the inside we've painted all the walls
sw04308-A_002544-003848 uh redone the floors completely because_1 the carpet was destroyed and um our last big project was the hall bathroom and uh we just finished that
sw04308-A_004457-005286 oh real successful it it it took us a long time because we couldn't afford to pay pay to have it done
sw04308-A_005286-005942 and if we had of paid to have it done they wouldn't have been as meticulous about everything as we are
sw04308-A_005942-006428 and um so i[t]- it worked out real well we're very pleased with it
sw04308-A_006999-007128 uh-huh

sw04308-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04308-B_000178-000338 me too
sw04308-B_003490-003657 [laughter]
sw04308-B_003808-004504 uh how successful were you o[f]- of what you wanted versus what actually happened
sw04308-B_005202-005331 um-hum
sw04308-B_006414-007079 yeah i i did uh i'm it's it's if it isn't one home project it's another
sw04308-B_007079-008150 and my last major home project was a a a screen porch on the backyard or in the on the back in the yeah in the backyard and uh
sw04308-B_008150-008292 [noise]
sw04308-B_008292-008624 well when they delivered all the parts [laughter]
sw04308-B_008624-009417 i joked about the bag of screws of six million screws well there were six million screws
sw04308-B_009417-009557 [noise]
sw04308-B_009557-010185 and i went through more tools because_1 it um i was using a power screwdriver
sw04308-B_010185-010718 and it or or or a screw driver a[ttachment]- attachment in a a power drill
sw04308-B_010718-011291 and the the attachment i kept on stripping the the ratchet uh head
sw04308-B_011291-012024 because they weren't design for um being um having any torque put on them from a sc[rew]- power power drill
sw04308-B_012024-012519 and so i'd have to stop in the middle of what i was doing and run up to Home Depot
sw04308-B_012519-013023 which incidentally is less than a thousand feet from my house
sw04308-B_013023-013283 [laughter] but um
sw04308-B_013283-013757 i had to run up to Home Depot get the part and work on it some more
sw04308-B_013757-014161 and then i'd realize i was missing another tool
sw04308-B_014161-014726 and run up to it and it went like this for a couple of weekends while i put this thing together
sw04308-B_014726-015089 but um it was
sw04308-B_015089-015662 that one wasn't so bad as much as tiling the floor of the bathroom where
sw04308-B_015662-016692 um i wiped out the bathroom i thought oh i can do this is a week and i got everything here i got all the tools and no sweat two months later i had it done
sw04308-B_016913-017073 [noise]
sw04308-B_017403-018323 yeah and it's f[or]- how easy they make it look on TV is they it's i swear they must leave out all the key
sw04308-B_018323-018621 things in their directions
sw04308-B_019017-019640 yes and it oh th[is]- this is obvious no it's not obvious you've got to tell us [laughter-that]
sw04308-B_019640-019803 [noise]
sw04308-B_020455-020592 um-hum
sw04308-B_022494-022903 yeah i i i find it enjoyable uh
sw04308-B_022903-023831 and it's not difficult difficultly uh not really difficult it's just the right tools make all the difference in the world
sw04308-B_024068-024490 uh no each project i might buy one new tool
sw04308-B_024490-025034 but as far as i- i don't count screw drivers as new tools i mean a new power tool
sw04308-B_025034-025512 uh but i might like the last time i put up a new range hood in the kitchen
sw04308-B_025512-026218 and i got tired of the old one the old one had this the blade that you could watch it go around when it was on high
sw04308-B_026218-027007 it was so slow and i said wait a minute this this isn't doing anything it's it's pushing the smoke back into the room
sw04308-B_027007-028121 so i went up to the store and i found the one that had the forty horsepower motor attached to the fan that when i flipped it on it started to rip the tiles off the floor
sw04308-B_028121-028673 and i said yeah that's the one i want that that way i'll make sure the smoke alarm doesn't go off
sw04308-B_028673-029251 and so when i p[ut]- started putting that one in i bought a um cordless screwdriver
sw04308-B_029251-029463 that was the last power tool i bought
sw04309-A_000000-000251 [noise] why what would you tell someone
sw04309-A_001333-001463 [vocalized-noise]
sw04309-A_001762-001906 um-hum
sw04309-A_002564-002696 uh-huh
sw04309-A_003277-003414 uh-huh
sw04309-A_004113-004237 um-hum
sw04309-A_005067-005207 um-hum
sw04309-A_006426-007682 well i guess i would agree somewhat i mean in terms of finding out first why they want to go to college if they do want to go to college a lot of times it's the parents who want them to go to college rather than themselves
sw04309-A_007682-008444 um but uh i think it's probably the the studies have been done looking at uh
sw04309-A_008444-009336 how well you are and what you do when you end up whether or not you uh have a degree or not uh makes a big difference later on in your life
sw04309-A_009336-010167 and um [vocalized-noise] you know it'd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire
sw04309-A_010167-010803 and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment [laughter]
sw04309-A_010803-011417 and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they don't know what else is better to do
sw04309-A_011417-011698 it seems like it's my experience
sw04309-A_011698-012278 but uh i guess that once they've decided they wanted to go to college
sw04309-A_012278-012758 i think that's that's also that's something [vocalized-noise] uh important but uh
sw04309-A_012758-013329 you know have them go through the i guess they have like the Barron's books and various other books that describes
sw04309-A_013329-013923 all the different colleges that they are in terms of competitiveness and things like that
sw04309-A_013923-014375 and they could also narrow it down that way other than just the economic things
sw04309-A_014375-014660 though it's probably more so now than used to be
sw04309-A_014660-015149 um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if
sw04309-A_015149-016406 you know you could always shoot for those places that don't ha[ve]- you know are [vocalized-noise] that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out on the first cut
sw04309-A_016406-016934 uh i would try to get them to to find the colleges they think that are
sw04309-A_016934-017882 you know best fit their needs in terms of the size the college the kinds of course offerings the reputation they have in those areas
sw04309-A_017882-018899 um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home there's a lot of different other aspects to it you know
sw04309-A_019023-019941 yeah and uh i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and and uh
sw04309-A_019941-020689 all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you that's important because if it's not well endowed school
sw04309-A_020689-021501 uh then a you know a lot of times they're just they uh the schools go from year to year based on just the enrollment
sw04309-A_021501-022471 and uh if that's what the school's doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times
sw04309-A_022471-023063 you know they're not as economically sound [laughter] right
sw04309-A_023538-023690 um-hum
sw04309-A_024238-024386 um-hum
sw04309-A_025927-026124 [vocalized-noise]
sw04309-A_027320-027546 oh yeah uh-huh
sw04309-A_027546-028054 yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have
sw04309-A_028054-028729 lots of other uh good and bad points sometimes the offerings that they have is better than
sw04309-A_028729-029179 you know some of the Ivy schools that's for sure uh
sw04309-A_029179-029422 but there's also other [laughter-problems] too
sw04309-A_029422-029952 um you know they tend to they all admit all sorts of people
sw04309-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04309-B_000190-000311 [laughter]
sw04309-B_000412-001245 well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to [vocalized-noise] their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want
sw04309-B_001245-001828 to do why are they're going why are they going to college instead of doing something else
sw04309-B_001828-002287 once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of
sw04309-B_002287-002636 uh what range of colleges they should go to
sw04309-B_002636-003367 uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldn't send them to an academic center and vice versa
sw04309-B_003367-004448 and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of going to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further
sw04309-B_004448-005173 and if you want to go something beyond what you can afford then you need to start investigating scholarship and other things
sw04309-B_005173-006334 so i think you start out with something broad like that and then narrow your range as you you know as you find out more about the child and what the their uh needs are and what they want to do
sw04309-B_006334-006505 how about you
sw04309-B_007187-007292 [noise]
sw04309-B_007589-007813 that does happen yes
sw04309-B_010139-010295 um-hum

sw04309-B_013819-013964 um-hum
sw04309-B_018852-019084 that does enter into it all
sw04309-B_020322-020455 [noise]
sw04309-B_022185-022368 yes
sw04309-B_022368-022588 [vocalized-noise]
sw04309-B_022906-023278 well i have a a daughter now who is
sw04309-B_023278-023709 a junior [vocalized-noise] who is looking at colleges and uh
sw04309-B_023709-024260 it's interesting uh there were a lot more choices years ago when i went to college
sw04309-B_024260-024518 and uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04309-B_024518-025344 she is is going through the process much like what you're you know you've described and i've des[cribed]- described so
sw04309-B_025344-026002 how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether it's a private or a public school
sw04309-B_026002-026312 what are the chances for scholarships
sw04309-B_026312-026749 and uh a lot of mid range smaller schools that
sw04309-B_026749-027400 are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course it's not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools
sw04309-B_027510-027651 and um
sw04309-B_027984-028121 [noise]
sw04309-B_028378-028556 um-hum
sw04310-A_000000-000054 [noise]

sw04310-A_002206-002351 uh-huh
sw04310-A_002729-003846 uh i've i've watched him yes he's [vocalized-noise] he's i've been told that that he uh well his ideologies won't work because he's too much of an authoritarian
sw04310-A_004041-005044 he does i- i- i from just his speaking i- i- i hear a a v[ery]- a strong tinge of integrity
sw04310-A_006299-006442 uh-huh
sw04310-A_007326-007458 uh-huh

sw04310-A_009968-010106 um-hum
sw04310-A_011729-012062 but are we what do you think are we talking about
sw04310-A_012062-012239 the
sw04310-A_012239-012906 the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think it's the human element
sw04310-A_013335-013490 exactly yes
sw04310-A_013590-013729 oh sure
sw04310-A_013996-014099 [vocalized-noise]
sw04310-A_014099-014227 [vocalized-noise]

sw04310-A_016333-016465 um-hum
sw04310-A_016610-016897 i think Dave i think one of the
sw04310-A_016897-017714 another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also
sw04310-A_017714-017828 we
sw04310-A_017828-018424 we the American people don't have faith in the government and they don't have faith in business
sw04310-A_018676-018842 exactly
sw04310-A_019085-019209 [vocalized-noise]
sw04310-A_019431-019562 [vocalized-noise]
sw04310-A_019912-021288 well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from GM
sw04310-A_021288-021683 and they're they're making
sw04310-A_021683-022187 four and five times they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
sw04310-A_022187-022556 GM is trying to market their products and is
sw04310-A_022556-023063 tha[t]- that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's
sw04310-A_023063-024002 so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just going what's this
sw04310-A_024553-024696 uh-huh
sw04310-A_025478-026462 you know i- i- i me[an]- i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with democra[cy]- with you know our capitalistic government
sw04310-A_026462-026954 the almighty dollar doesn't have any ethical code with it
sw04310-A_026954-027562 and i it's just like how you know what would you do the Exxon Valdez
sw04310-A_027562-028138 you see what what are we just just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because
sw04310-A_028138-028737 the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's
sw04310-A_028737-029904 the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something unfo[rtunately]-
sw04310-B_000000-000118 [noise] topic today
sw04310-B_000118-000715 there's a sound like a panel topic we're talking about uh what we can do to make uh
sw04310-B_000715-001259 make uh our government get a little more for it's money in other words [vocalized-noise]
sw04310-B_001359-001747 short long-term goals to be able to get
sw04310-B_001747-001969 a better value
sw04310-B_001969-002251 out of what we already pay
sw04310-B_002251-002762 and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man
sw04310-B_002895-003053 [vocalized-noise]
sw04310-B_003846-004178 yeah but he does raise some interesting points like
sw04310-B_004969-005200 uh-huh the uh
sw04310-B_005200-005715 the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day
sw04310-B_005715-006391 and he said [vocalized-noise] let's think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that we've got
sw04310-B_006391-007371 um [vocalized-noise] remember we're thinking about wild and crazy things we'll throw anything out he said um let's say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred
sw04310-B_007371-007517 for a year
sw04310-B_007517-007686 not enough money
sw04310-B_007686-007923 only half as much as we need
sw04310-B_007923-008151 so another words
sw04310-B_008151-008410 four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money
sw04310-B_008410-008768 uh and that's just he deficit just this year
sw04310-B_008768-009461 there's apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president's own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement
sw04310-B_009461-009737 i think that would be the short-term goals
sw04310-B_009737-010071 get rid of the fraud and mismanagement
sw04310-B_010071-010374 um apparently they have plenty of time
sw04310-B_010478-011798 the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me
sw04310-B_012817-013459 it's a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help
sw04310-B_013459-013664 could help track
sw04310-B_013664-014651 uh and and find out what's going on you know statistical cross-referencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know
sw04310-B_014651-015013 they do to keep in office to stay in office uh
sw04310-B_015013-015772 i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government
sw04310-B_015772-016394 um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit
sw04310-B_016394-016633 congress critters at all
sw04310-B_017632-017765 uh-huh
sw04310-B_018420-019181 yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh it's something that everyone can identify with and
sw04310-B_019181-019222 [noise]
sw04310-B_019222-019936 and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget
sw04310-B_022114-022291 um oh that
sw04310-B_023916-024053 um-hum
sw04310-B_024053-024255 yeah i think um it's
sw04310-B_024255-024617 uh i've been studying some libertarian views
sw04310-B_024617-025145 and i've been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of
sw04310-B_025145-025570 out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair
sw04310-B_026392-026529 um-hum

sw04310-B_028769-028896 well
sw04311-A_000000-000167 [noise]
sw04311-A_000167-000341 go ahead [laughter]
sw04311-A_001691-001833 hm
sw04311-A_001999-002300 well you should've you should have some opinions on that then
sw04311-A_004237-004699 well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety
sw04311-A_004699-004996 [noise] my second consideration would be uh
sw04311-A_004996-005169 [noise] um
sw04311-A_005169-005371 health
sw04311-A_005371-005746 and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh
sw04311-A_005746-005917 warm
sw04311-A_005917-006304 environment warm personal environment
sw04311-A_011374-012584 oh absolutely [noise] as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
sw04311-A_013288-013670 and it's the most difficult thing of all for a parent
sw04311-A_013670-014813 judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
sw04311-A_019035-019497 [noise] maybe the right thing to do is to um
sw04311-A_019497-019830 [noise] when a couple has a child
sw04311-A_019830-020874 [noise] then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and i think i would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting
sw04311-A_020874-021286 get rid of all these child care centers
sw04311-A_021286-021727 at least for young kids below the age of six
sw04311-A_021727-021967 and then [noise]
sw04311-A_021967-022991 um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer i[n]- in other words they probably would not work
sw04311-A_022991-023422 may not en[d]- may end up not working at all in the twenties
sw04311-A_023422-023611 oh
sw04311-A_023611-024306 but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
sw04311-A_024306-024620 [laughter]
sw04311-A_025262-025866 right well you know the uh uh the world is changing f[rom]- uh uh uh uh
sw04311-A_025866-027120 from instit[utional]- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
sw04311-A_027120-027746 all you have to do is have a sharp mind and i believe that uh mental acuity is
sw04311-A_027746-028450 easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind [noise]
sw04311-A_028450-029687 [noise] so i think a person could work [noise] uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main[tain]- maintain uh a
sw04311-B_000000-000107 [noise]
sw04311-B_000213-001009 oh [laughter-okay] yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and
sw04311-B_001009-001770 that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children but i did run a child care facility for a while
sw04311-B_001770-002150 and uh have some
sw04311-B_002150-003412 i do have some thoughts on that yeah and it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or a parent for a lot of people there
sw04311-B_003412-004258 and um [noise] it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose [noise] the child care facilities [noise]
sw04311-B_004656-004970 right [noise]
sw04311-B_005302-005459 right [noise]
sw04311-B_006223-007678 well right um in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate [noise] on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level so
sw04311-B_007678-008937 [noise] uh you meet the standards [noise] but then after that there's there's a lot more i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there
sw04311-B_008937-010147 and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people
sw04311-B_010147-011501 um in terms of not just just because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that
sw04311-B_011501-011701 that uh
sw04311-B_012536-013370 exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people
sw04311-B_013770-013918 oh
sw04311-B_014765-015866 oh exactly and the other thing that's difficult in uh an institutional setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment
sw04311-B_015866-017342 for the child because_1 you don't wanna just warehouse the child and i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four or five years are so important
sw04311-B_017342-018268 and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe an[d]-
sw04311-B_018268-019148 and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too
sw04311-B_020819-021025 that would be lovely
sw04311-B_021652-021800 um-hum
sw04311-B_023441-023721 well that's an interesting thought because
sw04311-B_024278-024815 that would be okay [laughter] that would that would help on the other end too
sw04311-B_024815-025409 in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be
sw04311-B_026347-026501 um-hum
sw04311-B_026992-027203 that's exactly right [vocalized-noise]
sw04311-B_028376-028524 oh
sw04312-A_000000-000172 [noise] what kind of music you into
sw04312-A_002235-002919 [laughter] the opera yeah it's right on track i like classical but i can't deal with opera at all
sw04312-A_003025-003731 and heavy metal uh it's noisy i'm into uh some industrial music that's
sw04312-A_003731-004389 a a bit even harder than that but it's it's got to have a point to it
sw04312-A_004711-004902 [laughter]
sw04312-A_005552-005747 [laughter]
sw04312-A_005930-006067 yeah
sw04312-A_006067-006303 what kind of progressive stuff
sw04312-A_008008-008163 uh
sw04312-A_009850-010896 oh yeah yeah it's a lot of people l[ike]- like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out i think that's pretty much you know bull
sw04312-A_010896-011845 because REM really hasn't changed it's it's it's interesting they're producing uh similar music and it's good music but you know people have picked up on it
sw04312-A_011845-012100 that's good i'm impressed
sw04312-A_013547-013778 [laughter]
sw04312-A_013778-014025 [laughter]
sw04312-A_014435-014588 oh yeah
sw04312-A_015574-015987 [laughter] uh but he picked the right songs and
sw04312-A_015987-016568 and that [laughter] that's about all he had going for him or still has for that matter
sw04312-A_016671-017787 oh yeah yeah i'm sure that that so[ld]- that sold a lot for him that's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop i'm ki[nd]- i've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop
sw04312-A_017787-018662 it just seems like there's no no real point you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises and
sw04312-A_019146-019300 uh-huh
sw04312-A_020749-020926 [laughter]
sw04312-A_021379-021500 [laughter]
sw04312-A_021500-022094 yeah i can i can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical what's the standard
sw04312-A_022588-022789 [laughter]
sw04312-A_023119-023299 [laughter]
sw04312-A_023885-024024 oh yes
sw04312-A_025150-025288 uh-huh
sw04312-A_025288-025545 [noise]
sw04312-A_026227-026412 [laughter]
sw04312-A_027015-027176 [laughter]
sw04312-A_027674-027838 it's safe
sw04312-A_028264-028468 [laughter]
sw04312-B_000000-000098 [noise]
sw04312-B_000098-001100 well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh
sw04312-B_001100-002318 lot of different forms of uh music in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that i don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal
sw04312-B_002970-003131 [noise] i've
sw04312-B_003951-004080 uh-huh
sw04312-B_004319-005064 oh i don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but uh the the uh
sw04312-B_005064-005969 basic point of heavy metal wh[ich]- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying
sw04312-B_005969-006295 [laughter]
sw04312-B_006295-007206 oh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh
sw04312-B_007206-008196 oh you know i'm thirty so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and REM
sw04312-B_008196-009042 that sort of stuff uh REM makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being
sw04312-B_009042-009945 uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed
sw04312-B_010586-010728 uh-huh
sw04312-B_011549-011686 uh-huh
sw04312-B_011990-013376 i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really ha[ve]- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh
sw04312-B_013376-014516 the Michael Bolton Mi[chael]- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
sw04312-B_014516-015646 and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money
sw04312-B_015932-016084 i guess
sw04312-B_016451-016740 th[at]- that and a marvelous hairdo
sw04312-B_016740-016945 [laughter]
sw04312-B_017742-017967 [laughter]
sw04312-B_018382-018524 uh-huh
sw04312-B_018684-019193 well i[t's]- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music
sw04312-B_019193-019724 and i like a lot of classical music but i also dislike
sw04312-B_019724-020773 uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music
sw04312-B_020773-021444 and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
sw04312-B_021908-023137 uh stuff that i like uh i like Bach i tolerate Vivaldi i can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy
sw04312-B_023137-023198 [laughter]
sw04312-B_023198-024346 uh uh i like Tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined uh and some of some
sw04312-B_024455-025212 stuff that i like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition
sw04312-B_025212-026044 and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded
sw04312-B_026044-026986 uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
sw04312-B_026986-027902 you know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know w[e'll]- we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it
sw04312-B_027902-028313 and i[t]- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me
sw04312-B_028313-029094 uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another
sw04312-B_029094-029952 and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
sw04313-A_000000-000163 [noise] well i guess uh
sw04313-A_000267-000797 start off by saying that i am very much in favor of space travel but i think we're going about it all wrong
sw04313-A_000797-000981 what are your thoughts
sw04313-A_002791-002950 um
sw04313-A_002950-003067 yeah
sw04313-A_003067-003610 well i am uh kind of disappointed by the way things have been going
sw04313-A_003610-004140 uh basically we've been out this at this for what about thirty five years
sw04313-A_004140-004374 from the first experimental
sw04313-A_004374-004991 well first experimental vanguard type stuff uh i think that was called the first uh the modified B twos and things like that
sw04313-A_004991-005221 that was late fifties i believe so
sw04313-A_005221-005509 and um if you
sw04313-A_005509-006180 look at the progress that was made at the turn of the century in aviation in a period of thirty five years
sw04313-A_006180-006535 in my assessment it was spectacularly better
sw04313-A_006651-007391 and um i don't think that's because the complexity of the task i think that's because it's being handled by bureaucracy now
sw04313-A_008325-009262 well i'm excited about these fellows who are experimenting commercially i'm excited about uh the commercial end of satellite operations
sw04313-A_009262-009770 um there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there and uh
sw04313-A_010803-011285 well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research
sw04313-A_012860-013426 well they have some organizations out there with some fairly deep pockets and uh i think that
sw04313-A_013769-013925 yeah well maybe
sw04313-A_015933-016147 well you go ahead
sw04313-A_017473-017596 um
sw04313-A_018571-018703 um
sw04313-A_018828-018954 go ahead
sw04313-A_019722-019846 um-hum
sw04313-A_020485-020647 well
sw04313-A_021713-021832 [laughter]
sw04313-A_021832-022033 it's not as effective now as it was [laughter-then]
sw04313-A_022033-022194 [laughter]
sw04313-A_022974-023145 it may be obsolete
sw04313-A_023145-023561 yeah yeah you know i uh what do you call it um
sw04313-A_023561-023946 i think it's important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen
sw04313-A_023946-024451 um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and th[at]- by that i mean [vocalized-noise]
sw04313-A_024451-025181 you know i don't know about i'm not going to speculate about research across the board but let's suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research
sw04313-A_025181-025530 and you're three or four competitors and you're debating whether to um
sw04313-A_025530-025852 throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years
sw04313-A_025852-026204 but it's going to be a real long term uh play
sw04313-A_026204-026590 or whether you're just going to sit back and watch television and um
sw04313-A_026590-027445 when you look when you see that your primary competitor is um a government with very deep pockets that's going to give the fruits to your competitors
sw04313-A_027445-028035 the obvious correct decision is to sit back and wait for them to give it to everybody rather than doing it yourself
sw04313-A_028035-028707 so i think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount of uh private uh effort put into it
sw04313-A_028707-029643 uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon it's going to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag
sw04313-B_000748-000896 okay with that
sw04313-B_000896-001045 [laughter]
sw04313-B_001045-001817 uh i'd like you to expound on that a little bit but uh i am very much in favor of it too and i think that we need to take the approach that
sw04313-B_001817-002667 so much technology is advanced out of the uh space program that it's amazing to me that we don't
sw04313-B_002667-002861 put more money into it
sw04313-B_002861-003016 [laughter]
sw04313-B_004094-004571 uh well yeah well it depends on what you're say[ing]- yeah that i guess
sw04313-B_004571-004734 um-hum
sw04313-B_004916-005111 [noise] okay
sw04313-B_005111-005266 yeah
sw04313-B_005935-006073 um-hum
sw04313-B_006516-006742 well there's no doubt about that
sw04313-B_007390-008326 well you so you're saying you thought uh that well that that implies to me that you would you should've felt like it should've been uh turned over to a commercial market
sw04313-B_009638-010281 well i think that uh satellites now that is a that is a market where there's a a valid
sw04313-B_010281-010848 reason for commercial uh when it comes to research i'm not sure i agree with that
sw04313-B_011197-012168 oh no reasons i just don't think that uh a commercial organization could successfully uh uh make it profitable for them
sw04313-B_012168-012905 uh i mean [noise] and besides the fact it it also would be extremely limiting as to which research it'd be be whichever one happened to bring in the dollar
sw04313-B_013315-013764 but US is notorious for not spending any money on research
sw04313-B_013764-015260 uh our commercial mark[et]- uh our commercial percentages are much lower than uh mos[t]- most of the other major countries as compared to Japan compared to Germany compared to uh most of the Scandinavian countries
sw04313-B_015260-016262 the amount of money uh put towards research is is minuscule and had minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years th[at]- so i'm not so sure that that would be
sw04313-B_016262-017524 i- i- i agree that the bureaucracy in most cases is something [laughter-which] it should be avoided and we have we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it and it seeps over in a lot of different ways
sw04313-B_017524-018759 now uh in space i don't think you could do it any other way uh w[ell]- i'd say fact my opinion is what we ought to do is we ought to get all these all the countries involved in these things and in fact
sw04313-B_018909-019823 oh well be[cause]- i mean we have um resources across the world i mean i- i we're coming out to a global global economy anyways
sw04313-B_019823-020590 so why aren't we using the Japanese technology why aren't we using the European technology why aren't see
sw04313-B_020590-021952 see space travel is a world issue it's not a US issue and and our our our kind of elitism attitude we had in the sixties about US uh love it or leave it [vocalized-noise] and you know actually we still have it but that whole
sw04313-B_021952-023073 right um that th[e]- th[e]- the concept of beating the other uh countries i think is somewhat
sw04313-B_023073-023359 yeah it's somewhat obsolete [laughter] and i think
sw04313-B_025109-025251 right
sw04313-B_025773-025911 um-hum
sw04313-B_029685-029952 [laughter] i would say that i have absolutely no
sw04314-A_000000-000081 [noise] [vocalized-noise]
sw04314-A_000253-000387 yeah
sw04314-A_000387-000518 all r[ight]-
sw04314-A_000622-001684 yeah i'm kind of into it i'm uh kind of a sailor i'm up in Minneapolis now but i was in Florida so uh [noise] yeah i was kind of getting to it for a while there

sw04314-A_005691-005834 yeah
sw04314-A_005834-005962 [laughter]
sw04314-A_005962-006927 not not not too many no but uh no i just got back from a weekend where we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but uh
sw04314-A_006927-008320 no i i have uh i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff that's a lot of fun but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it but
sw04314-A_008483-008845 oh yeah i guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh
sw04314-A_008845-009001 yeah
sw04314-A_009001-009587 yeah all right so where about in Texas is that is that centrally located or
sw04314-A_009812-010197 uh no what what major city is nearby
sw04314-A_010197-010547 okay and that's south or north of there or some[thing]-
sw04314-A_010745-010931 yeah okay
sw04314-A_010931-011677 oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
sw04314-A_012034-012164 yeah
sw04314-A_012265-013013 okay well that's pretty temperate yeah that's not too bad but uh [noise] yeah have you done uh any other boating then or
sw04314-A_013532-013663 yeah
sw04314-A_014024-014260 oh that's great yeah i
sw04314-A_014260-015401 oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd wor[k]- go to work
sw04314-A_015401-016143 yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually
sw04314-A_016422-017508 well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um m[y]- my family's pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh [noise]
sw04314-A_017508-018429 yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
sw04314-A_018429-019663 so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody i've i've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun
sw04314-A_019663-020652 yeah yeah a lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may [ne'er/never] m[ay]- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
sw04314-A_020652-021555 and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know
sw04314-A_021555-021877 yeah they get pretty quick but uh
sw04314-A_021877-022928 yeah yeah i haven't i haven't personally done that but um the races i i work with a guy right now that uh [noise] races catamarans in the summertime
sw04314-A_022928-023285 and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh
sw04314-A_023424-024688 well he uh he's from Detroit so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to Orlando uh in about a month
sw04314-A_024688-025650 and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the East Coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know
sw04314-A_025650-025898 so uh so that's a good thing
sw04314-A_025898-026254 but yeah so what do you do for a job
sw04314-A_026410-026724 oh really okay is that for TI or

sw04314-B_016979-017108 yeah
sw04314-B_017419-017588 is it pretty easy
sw04314-B_018381-018510 yeah
sw04314-B_019488-019769 yeah that well that's about all we [laughter-have]
sw04314-B_020605-020747 um-hum
sw04314-B_021449-021592 i didn't know that
sw04314-B_021592-021718 [vocalized-noise]
sw04314-B_021718-021920 that that'd be something
sw04314-B_022857-022997 um-hum
sw04314-B_023223-023467 what kind of what lake do y'all u[se]-
sw04314-B_023641-023774 um-hum
sw04314-B_025341-025484 ooh
sw04314-B_025835-025972 yeah
sw04314-B_026180-026453 uh we[ll]- i build transformers
sw04314-B_026453-026632 yeah
sw04314-B_026632-026942 no it's for Cooper Industries
sw04314-B_027219-027371 yeah
sw04314-B_027371-027715 well they have a you know worldwide but
sw04314-B_027715-028214 w[ell]- well all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
sw04314-B_028406-028707 it's real nice living here all my life
sw04314-B_028707-028838 yep
sw04314-B_029101-029364 oh it's n[o]- Oklahoma's nothing like it
sw04314-B_029587-029747 [laughter]
sw04315-A_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04315-A_000028-000400 so David uh what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of Florida
sw04315-A_000797-000947 oh that's right
sw04315-A_001175-001397 oh so the laws are still intact then
sw04315-A_002325-002480 um-hum
sw04315-A_002480-002797 and i imagine that costs a small bundle too
sw04315-A_002899-003091 go through the court process
sw04315-A_003974-004105 um-hum
sw04315-A_004856-005806 no but i think it does serve a valuable purpose in the sense that the victims get some sort of satisfaction the community doesn't pay for the burden of having a
sw04315-A_005806-006052 a prisoner in jail for twenty years
sw04315-A_006152-006507 you know and having to supply them with a color TV and
sw04315-A_006507-006883 um books and education so forth
sw04315-A_007512-007769 and i imagine it probably costs
sw04315-A_007769-008314 a great deal amount of money to to even go through the process of trying to electrocute someone
sw04315-A_008314-008800 to the court [proceum/processing] i mean it tying up attorney's t[ime]- uh times the court system
sw04315-A_010261-010385 um-hum
sw04315-A_010735-010959 well how do you feel about that do you
sw04315-A_010959-011210 are you in favor of capital punishment as a
sw04315-A_011358-011488 um-hum
sw04315-A_012499-012645 yeah i'm from New Hampshire
sw04315-A_012752-013166 yeah as far as i remember we don't have it um
sw04315-A_013166-013889 i know there hasn't been anyone executed up here probably in about thirty forty years which is ironic because we come from very conservative state
sw04315-A_013889-014296 uh very strong on on punishment and crime
sw04315-A_014296-015250 um it uh dur[ing]- one thing we don't really have th[at]- that much crime up here when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i don't know if you heard about that
sw04315-A_015250-015407 right
sw04315-A_015512-016001 yeah that's a case where um she's probably guilty
sw04315-A_016001-016521 i don't think there's enough evidence there to convict her i mean to uh
sw04315-A_016521-016679 execute her
sw04315-A_016679-017543 i think if because_1 once you execute some[one]- the the the dec[ision]- the decision is final you can't really reverse the [laughter-process] um
sw04315-A_018640-018760 um-hum
sw04315-A_018864-019117 yeah i don't agree with that either i think if you
sw04315-A_019117-019478 kill someone who's innocent that's uh
sw04315-A_019653-019877 somebody you can't even live with if they
sw04315-A_019978-020437 y[ou]- you really need t[o]- you know case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President uh
sw04315-A_020540-021030 right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be e[xecuted]- executed
sw04315-A_021030-021242 uh whether he's insane or not
sw04315-A_021242-021647 same thing with Dahlmer i mean he killed seventeen people
sw04315-A_021647-021939 uh i[t's]- it's a shame that we're gonna have to pay for him
sw04315-A_022133-022255 what's that
sw04315-A_022255-022671 i think [vocalized-noise] uh Michigan or some[where]- somewhere around there
sw04315-A_024594-024898 yeah but i thought he he received his s[entence]- um
sw04315-A_024898-025253 [vocalized-noise] remember maybe what the what the final turnout was
sw04315-A_025380-025787 i thought he went to re[habilitation]- rehabilitation mean they they were going to put him in
sw04315-A_025787-026095 rehabilitation for a few years then prison for the rest of his life
sw04315-A_028052-028174 um-hum
sw04315-A_028958-029785 yeah i think that's a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of
sw04315-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04315-B_000372-000852 they have the electric chair i believe remember Ted Bundy
sw04315-B_000852-001278 couple years ago they were all down there saying fry him [laughter]
sw04315-B_001278-001732 oh yeah th[ey]- yeah they use that all the time well not all the time is
sw04315-B_001732-002602 you know it i[t]- it's always backlogged it usually takes a guy usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they put him you know in the ac[tual]- actual electric chair
sw04315-B_002762-003077 yeah he always gets all these appeals and everything
sw04315-B_003077-003679 he gets all these appeals and everything uh as far as it being a deterrent to people i don't think it's a de[terrent]- a deterrent
sw04315-B_003679-004330 uh i think it's i think it's more for the families more than anything the families probably get some justification out of it
sw04315-B_004330-004794 but uh as far as it deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that i don't think it really does
sw04315-B_005400-005558 the victims can
sw04315-B_005998-006150 that's right
sw04315-B_006150-006289 that's right
sw04315-B_006800-007493 right i mean what is it how much is it a year to keep a prisoner it's like twenty thousand a year to food and clothe a prisoner
sw04315-B_007493-007668 some ridi[culous]- price
sw04315-B_008269-008431 yeah
sw04315-B_008819-009094 yeah i don't know how many appeals Ted Bundy had
sw04315-B_009094-009752 uh they just keep appealing it and appealing it to the next higher next higher you know just keeps they keep going higher and higher up
sw04315-B_009752-009904 and uh
sw04315-B_010006-010686 you know it does take a long time it takes money [laughter-of] [laughter-course] to do that so and it's a public defender most of the time so
sw04315-B_011100-012087 yeah yes i am i am in favor of it but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i don't think it is like i said it's mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims
sw04315-B_012087-012361 uh th[e]- you know the family of the victims
sw04315-B_012361-012615 do you guys have it up there where where'd you say you were from
sw04315-B_012615-012851 okay New Hampshire they have it up there
sw04315-B_013056-013186 [vocalized-noise]
sw04315-B_015162-015342 that's the schoolteacher one
sw04315-B_015342-015603 i saw the movie about [laughter-that]
sw04315-B_016638-016758 um-hum
sw04315-B_017420-017832 well that is the bad thing about it and i'm i'm sure that back in the old days they
sw04315-B_017832-018951 they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process but they're but they're uh opinion was well if you got few few innocent people have to die to protect the majority then that's okay you [laughter-know] i don't i don't necessarily agree with that
sw04315-B_019351-019686 it screwed up the whole thing in my opinion yeah i agree with you there
sw04315-B_020323-020585 that's pretty obvious that's open and shut isn't it
sw04315-B_020956-021092 that's right
sw04315-B_021201-021328 that's right
sw04315-B_021562-021698 right
sw04315-B_021698-021849 now
sw04315-B_021849-022168 in his case now is that that's Minnesota right
sw04315-B_022168-022368 is that Minnesota
sw04315-B_022368-022621 or Wisconsin or ah maybe it's Wis[consin]-
sw04315-B_022621-023603 yeah they they might have capital punishment the thing with people like that they like to take and study them_1 put them_1 in jail and do studies on them like that so that's they can try to get a profile of his personality i think
sw04315-B_023603-023736 you know and
sw04315-B_023736-024664 i guess in states where they don't have capital punishment that's the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because_1 all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff aren't going to tolerate it
sw04315-B_025160-025480 what is the final uh is he still going to trial for that
sw04315-B_026011-026532 that's right because_1 he's definitely insane i think they proved that he was insane and maybe that's
sw04315-B_026532-027321 maybe that was uh what got him off or made him uh not get the death penalty because_1 they can prove that he's insane then i- i don't think you get the death penalty
sw04315-B_027321-027696 but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh
sw04315-B_027696-028720 say that he was sane when he committed them_1 so they could but they they were going for the death penalty i think that's what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he going to get the death penalty or life in prison
sw04315-B_028720-029031 yeah i think the families wanted him to get death [laughter]
sw04316-A_000001-000744 do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now i mean i guess any crime is too much but it's out of control
sw04316-A_004138-004289 really
sw04316-A_004289-004619 i would not of i okay_1 i wouldn't have guessed that in Seattle
sw04316-A_004619-004869 yeah i know
sw04316-A_005529-005873 yeah i wonder i mean i wonder [vocalized-noise] what
sw04316-A_005873-006847 what really is the answer i mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or a penal system
sw04316-A_007024-007160 yeah
sw04316-A_007660-008792 but but the problem is th[at]- that we we only have but so much room and we we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes and
sw04316-A_008792-008996 so it's uh
sw04316-A_009522-009903 i get the feeling that a lot of people have i'm not convinced that i have
sw04316-A_009903-010900 um see i mean my mom taught English as a second language a[nd]- and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and um
sw04316-A_010900-012193 yes in a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison i mean
sw04316-A_012193-012918 it was it was i mean they they put her i mean i didn't obviously didn't see the classroom u[m]- um [laughter-and] hopefully never will
sw04316-A_012918-013747 but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body a[larm]- a body alarm
sw04316-A_013747-014403 which i know i don't know exactly what that is but i just assume it's something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people
sw04316-A_014403-014556 but uh
sw04316-A_014556-014815 [vocalized-noise] you know i- i'd ge[t]-
sw04316-A_014815-016122 no she didn't she didn't she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse and uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
sw04316-A_016122-017139 but well she had decided that it was when we came back to the states she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison
sw04316-A_017139-017315 but uh
sw04316-A_017513-018938 yeah but but the point there was is that it you know you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and and i'm i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it
sw04316-A_019533-019681 um-hum
sw04316-A_020730-021588 but getting i mean [vocalized-noise] well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but
sw04316-A_021588-021743 but i kee[p]-
sw04316-A_021743-022175 i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is
sw04316-A_022175-023265 circumstances i mean i can't help but wonder if if i grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point or another
sw04316-A_023604-023913 i mean i don't know i don't know
sw04316-A_024923-025541 we got methadone programs where people who desperately wanna get off drugs can't get onto the program
sw04316-A_025992-026728 i don't i don't remember the the gentleman's name but there's the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar and what he
sw04316-A_026954-027776 well what he wants to do is take all the money that um he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education
sw04316-A_027776-028342 and basically just just attack the problem at the demand side
sw04316-A_028342-029738 stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't i mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and

sw04316-B_006758-007080 yeah i think most people regard it as a warehouse

sw04316-B_008552-008851 yeah that's what i hear
sw04316-B_008851-009438 yeah i i think you know don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea
sw04316-B_009828-009964 yeah
sw04316-B_010754-011102 oh you mean she taught in a prison oh i see

sw04316-B_023773-024266 i mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as
sw04316-B_024266-024946 you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's mo[re]- been more crime
sw04316-B_025342-025807 yeah there's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse an[d]-

sw04317-B_017701-018046 i think they might be a little bit more hard to handle too
sw04317-B_018046-018691 you got to keep them_1 occupied and then plus you end up with a fish hooks in your ears and stuff like that [laughter]
sw04317-B_020030-020291 well that's all they care about anyway
sw04317-B_020291-020596 [vocalized-noise] casting that's all my boy cares about
sw04317-B_020596-021083 seeing how for he can throw it i've tried to explain to him fish can swim
sw04317-B_021083-021299 [laughter-he] [laughter-don't] believe me
sw04317-B_021899-022021 uh-huh
sw04317-B_022500-022647 [noise]
sw04317-B_022647-023104 we drove we drove through there and looked that looks like it'd be beautiful out there
sw04317-B_023952-024100 [laughter]
sw04317-B_024100-024192 sort of
sw04317-B_024498-025114 yeah i don't know if i could take that last time we went camping i went with my brother and his wife and
sw04317-B_025114-025563 we went up the on top of this mountain it was a little narrow road
sw04317-B_025563-026187 and it takes it's just eighteen miles but it takes like a hour and a half to get up that road it's a rough road
sw04317-B_026187-027149 so we get up there and we sit around and we get ready to get ready for the camp that night and and they didn't bring the poles to hold their tent up [laughter]
sw04317-B_027149-027808 [laughter] [laughter-so] we're all had to cram this one little tiny tent and it rained all night long
sw04317-B_027808-028610 [laughter] and i was stuck at the door and it just it just flooded me all night long this so that has been our last little camping experience
sw04317-B_028610-028995 but uh we enjoyed it if w[e]- if you don't get pneumonia
sw04317-B_029516-029799 well there's getting less and less of it
sw04317-B_029799-029895 i think
sw04318-A_000000-000327 [noise] before the one will take um
sw04318-A_000327-000572 okay let's see i guess um
sw04318-A_000572-001046 i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because_1 our family's growing yeah
sw04318-A_001046-001170 um
sw04318-A_001170-001949 so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon
sw04318-A_001949-002382 so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um
sw04318-A_002382-003209 so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well
sw04318-A_003597-004066 um i don't really have a preference either way i guess i[t]- you know it's
sw04318-A_004066-004888 you know [vocalized-noise] i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
sw04318-A_005423-005550 um-hum
sw04318-A_006743-006943 yeah
sw04318-A_008145-009272 yeah i mean e[ven]- even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that [vocalized-noise] doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while an[d]- and it's clearly just a a design problem there
sw04318-A_010692-010812 um-hum
sw04318-A_011109-011354 oh like a Miata or something like that
sw04318-A_012115-012238 um
sw04318-A_012612-012734 interest[ing]-
sw04318-A_012936-013062 yeah
sw04318-A_013313-014205 that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because_1 i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably
sw04318-A_014205-014336 uh-huh
sw04318-A_015565-016177 yeah yeah i c[an]- i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
sw04318-A_016177-016649 and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you
sw04318-A_016649-017438 what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
sw04318-A_017438-017752 and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton
sw04318-A_017752-018426 it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
sw04318-A_018426-018845 um the other ninety four thousand have been [laughter-just] [laughter-fine] [laughter-with] [laughter-it] so
sw04318-A_018845-019000 but uh
sw04318-A_020780-020904 um
sw04318-A_021316-021447 um-hum
sw04318-A_022035-022159 yeah
sw04318-A_022599-022764 that's interesting
sw04318-A_022764-023145 but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh
sw04318-A_023145-024101 like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one Corsica that's uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because
sw04318-A_024101-024561 Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM
sw04318-A_024561-025465 after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
sw04318-A_025465-025588 yeah
sw04318-A_025588-026354 because_1 uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
sw04318-A_026354-026727 on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and
sw04318-A_026727-027842 guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what GM corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
sw04318-A_028051-029099 so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now
sw04318-A_029099-029285 but uh
sw04318-A_029285-029525 uh it's interesting but uh
sw04318-A_029596-029863 i don't know if if uh i[t]- it seems to be
sw04318-B_000000-000850 [noise]
sw04318-B_000850-000999 are you really
sw04318-B_001897-002149 uh-huh which are both kind of small
sw04318-B_003044-003643 uh-huh are you looking for an American car or y[ou]- you open to buying foreign cars
sw04318-B_003880-004005 uh-huh
sw04318-B_004398-004528 uh-huh
sw04318-B_004702-004827 right
sw04318-B_004827-005829 personally i have a Japanese car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the Japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh
sw04318-B_005829-007171 you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but i feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh
sw04318-B_007171-008348 i would be partial to buying another Japanese car but i would also look at American cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product so if i were
sw04318-B_008453-008602 right
sw04318-B_009221-009774 right it is um i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be
sw04318-B_009774-010741 sort of a sports car i would really like to have a sports car um [noise] i don't really i don't have a family so i don't need a a minivan or such to uh [noise] haul people around in
sw04318-B_010741-011147 so i'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh
sw04318-B_011252-012331 well i like the Miata but i don't like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the the car that i really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car but uh
sw04318-B_012331-012576 something along that lines
sw04318-B_012576-013372 uh because_1 i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
sw04318-B_013884-014007 right
sw04318-B_014107-015107 right that's when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was ge[t]- that i would get a
sw04318-B_015107-015638 for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money
sw04318-B_015638-015761 so
sw04318-B_016049-016208 right exactly
sw04318-B_016421-016552 yeah
sw04318-B_016800-016975 um that's right
sw04318-B_017163-017292 uh-huh
sw04318-B_017659-017784 uh-huh
sw04318-B_018330-018454 uh-huh
sw04318-B_018768-018890 okay
sw04318-B_018991-019193 uh i've had uh
sw04318-B_019193-019495 i've had one or two American cars i think and
sw04318-B_019495-019997 and they were okay i had a Pontiac once and and i never had a problem with it but
sw04318-B_019997-021144 uh my mother had a Dodge at one point and i- i had driven it a few times and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a Dodge [noise] ju[st]- just from well actually i had a uh
sw04318-B_021144-021943 a Dodge Omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh
sw04318-B_021943-022091 car
sw04318-B_022091-022617 so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
sw04318-B_024319-024449 um-hum
sw04318-B_024822-024960 right
sw04318-B_024960-025360 [vocalized-noise]
sw04318-B_025360-025540 which is a good deal
sw04318-B_026082-026212 um-hum
sw04318-B_026314-026442 right
sw04318-B_026948-027078 yeah that
sw04318-B_027672-027950 [laughter] yeah i'm sure they did
sw04318-B_028565-028699 uh-huh
sw04318-B_028805-028937 right
sw04319-A_000000-000005 [noise]
sw04319-A_000005-000458 uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them
sw04319-A_002423-002645 oh that's good
sw04319-A_002645-002792 uh-huh
sw04319-A_002792-003016 what kind of a degree have you got
sw04319-A_003174-003310 oh
sw04319-A_003463-003586 uh-huh
sw04319-A_004403-004524 uh-huh
sw04319-A_005053-005197 uh-huh
sw04319-A_005399-005526 uh-huh
sw04319-A_005526-005716 how long have you been with them
sw04319-A_005788-006024 uh that's good
sw04319-A_006458-006602 uh-huh
sw04319-A_008012-008146 uh-huh
sw04319-A_008247-008370 uh-huh
sw04319-A_008770-008892 uh-huh
sw04319-A_008892-009280 but for for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
sw04319-A_009280-009705 so that you've got got small small things to gripe about
sw04319-A_009705-010016 wow well that sounds like you must feel really good about it
sw04319-A_010317-010451 wow
sw04319-A_010858-011054 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04319-A_011314-011437 wow
sw04319-A_011554-012101 well i uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory
sw04319-A_012101-012847 i also have a part time job at a law firm and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour
sw04319-A_012847-013846 than my my sort of quote real job does uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh [noise]
sw04319-A_013846-014770 they just uh they're not the greatest uh i before i i uh [noise] uh got my degree i'm uh c[omputer]- a computer scientist
sw04319-A_014770-015587 and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington and uh
sw04319-A_015587-016865 at that time i was in gravy city uh the law firms [laughter] in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties and uh benefits were just amazing and
sw04319-A_016865-018225 we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal uh but it's you know it's it's okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our
sw04319-A_018225-019170 uh uh our costs and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
sw04319-A_019170-020248 and uh [noise] so i i think i'm actually involved in a relatively good p[lan]- plan at this point um but uh it could be better that's for sure and
sw04319-A_020248-020769 uh [noise] but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- uh
sw04319-A_020769-021881 in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere it's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i don't have to uh
sw04319-A_021881-023014 uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and [noise] so i'm i'm really kind of happy about that end of of things it's uh
sw04319-A_023569-023717 uh-huh
sw04319-A_024689-024817 uh-huh
sw04319-A_025452-026441 wow that's fabulous you see now that's that's interesting because i have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area he he lives in Andover
sw04319-A_026441-027495 and uh the work that he he's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh [noise] uh sonographic imagining
sw04319-A_027495-028667 and uh i've been over to see his complex over there and it's amazing it's it's all ecologically designed and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up
sw04319-A_028667-028789 and
sw04319-A_029154-029305 uh-huh
sw04319-B_000383-001296 uh pretty good actually i work for Hewlett Packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact they're they're kind of known
sw04319-B_001296-001799 uh for having good benefits the pay isn't fabulous although
sw04319-B_001799-002938 i saw a survey recently and i'm actually making just about as much as you know i'm m[aking]- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me so
sw04319-B_002938-003234 i've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering so
sw04319-B_003234-003533 and i'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
sw04319-B_003533-004430 uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good we've got stock purchase program and a that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years
sw04319-B_004430-005441 before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain but uh [noise] there's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income
sw04319-B_005441-005659 uh there's
sw04319-B_005659-005878 i've been with them for seven years
sw04319-B_005878-006750 yeah and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything
sw04319-B_006750-008066 so uh it's not too but there's full uh th[ere]- there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i don't get sick that often so i don't pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital
sw04319-B_008066-008316 that you know for a checkup or whatever
sw04319-B_008316-008437 um
sw04319-B_008437-008833 they don't cover eyes though and i i have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain
sw04319-B_008833-009086 but you know i i can live
sw04319-B_009200-009384 oh yeah yeah
sw04319-B_009627-009765 right
sw04319-B_009765-009901 and
sw04319-B_009901-010345 yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing
sw04319-B_010345-011373 because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but that's not the case so i [laughter] guess nothing it's fabulous
sw04319-B_011373-011608 uh the what about you
sw04319-B_012808-012956 uh-huh
sw04319-B_013100-013230 [laughter]
sw04319-B_014060-014197 uh
sw04319-B_014690-014852 uh-huh
sw04319-B_015174-015298 uh-huh
sw04319-B_016366-016525 yeah
sw04319-B_016741-016895 uh-huh
sw04319-B_020095-020231 yeah
sw04319-B_022937-023801 yeah the one of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security and uh there's a lot of different
sw04319-B_023801-024751 things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do so there's uh i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company
sw04319-B_024751-025558 and it's and i and i haven't had to move my residence to do that you know i still live in San Jose and
sw04319-B_025558-025713 yeah it
sw04319-B_026086-026210 oh yeah
sw04319-B_026210-026339 yeah
sw04319-B_026339-026506 uh-huh
sw04319-B_027416-027544 right
sw04319-B_027984-028115 um
sw04319-B_028646-029617 yeah yeah in fact i know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position
sw04319-B_029617-029917 kind of interesting um uh anyhow
sw04320-A_000000-000006 [noise]
sw04320-A_000006-000192 okay
sw04320-A_000192-000386 [laughter]
sw04320-A_000386-001104 well needless to say here in Washington DC [laughter] this is the war zone
sw04320-A_001104-001561 uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital
sw04320-A_001561-002587 it's uh it's really bad here uh for example [noise] the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns
sw04320-A_002587-003532 and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things
sw04320-A_003532-003676 so i[t]-
sw04320-A_003676-003774 [noise]
sw04320-A_003774-003912 uh-huh
sw04320-A_004273-004411 uh-huh
sw04320-A_004864-004998 uh-huh
sw04320-A_005567-005732 uh-huh
sw04320-A_006344-007700 uh-huh right that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess and uh [noise] now the interestingly enough i don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh
sw04320-A_007700-008741 only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory
sw04320-A_008741-009923 [noise] and so they're protecting their [laughter] economic interests i guess and uh n[ow]- nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as
sw04320-A_009923-011186 uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up
sw04320-A_011186-012011 and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away [laughter] and leave you standing in front of your house
sw04320-A_012011-012843 yeah that's the uh latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want
sw04320-A_012964-013716 uh-huh right [laughter] just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get [laughter-in] off they go with your car
sw04320-A_013716-014228 so it's uh i think they call it car jacking around here [laughter]
sw04320-A_014228-015177 [noise] uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but [noise] oh every year in the DC area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's
sw04320-A_015177-016202 uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from uh i'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so
sw04320-A_016202-017504 [noise] and we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for [noise] for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes
sw04320-A_017504-017667 [noise]
sw04320-A_017772-018698 right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of DC is having a real problem uh
sw04320-A_018698-019445 trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like DC where it's a way of life for everybody it's uh
sw04320-A_019445-020397 i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem i don't know what what the solution is uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing [noise]
sw04320-A_021059-021210 uh-huh
sw04320-A_021210-021359 uh-huh
sw04320-A_022480-022648 uh-huh
sw04320-A_023039-023459 [laughter-right] and they see all their friends and neighbors uh
sw04320-A_023459-024793 yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because
sw04320-A_024793-025002 this is the way they were raised
sw04320-A_025127-025724 right [laughter] exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's
sw04320-A_025724-026257 it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so i don't know it's
sw04320-A_026257-026928 [noise] i'm glad it's not the kind of problem i have to [noise] [laughter] come up with an answer to because it's not easy
sw04320-A_027572-027731 uh-huh
sw04320-A_028124-028373 right they've always been with us
sw04320-A_028868-029014 uh-huh
sw04320-A_029448-029599 uh-huh
sw04320-A_029795-029917 [laughter-right]
sw04320-B_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04320-B_000061-000490 so how serious is the subject of crime in your area
sw04320-B_001491-001655 [laughter]
sw04320-B_002560-002720 jeez
sw04320-B_003537-004356 well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
sw04320-B_004356-004950 uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns
sw04320-B_004950-005697 uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core
sw04320-B_005697-006542 uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of [noise] poverty conditions
sw04320-B_006957-007090 yeah
sw04320-B_007874-008023 uh-huh
sw04320-B_008708-008837 uh-huh
sw04320-B_009203-009340 [laughter-yeah]
sw04320-B_011896-012109 oh well that's efficient
sw04320-B_012704-013126 they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort
sw04320-B_013424-013564 [laughter]
sw04320-B_013678-013823 wow
sw04320-B_014106-014347 [noise] yeah yeah i'd heard that phrase
sw04320-B_016163-016319 uh-huh
sw04320-B_017468-017860 yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
sw04320-B_018194-018351 uh-huh
sw04320-B_020318-021365 well uh [noise] there's a couple of things that i've heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do uh
sw04320-B_021365-022282 course the [noise] the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else s[eems]- seems to be just you know the the the
sw04320-B_022282-023115 end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because i mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything
sw04320-B_023115-023238 uh
sw04320-B_023238-023529 and they're accidental parents half the time anyway
sw04320-B_024886-025212 it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it
sw04320-B_025508-025642 yeah
sw04320-B_026783-027724 well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem um
sw04320-B_027724-028204 the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away
sw04320-B_028204-028365 uh
sw04320-B_028365-028605 i mean there's there's been a lot of
sw04320-B_028605-029535 and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
sw04320-B_029535-029917 uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
sw04321-A_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04321-A_000019-000248 well have you ever served on a jury
sw04321-A_000810-001226 well i was called and then i was not chosen
sw04321-A_002794-002981 oh really
sw04321-A_007955-008451 well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that
sw04321-A_012749-012952 well i mean
sw04321-A_012952-013278 i think are you just trying to say that
sw04321-A_013278-013597 criminal cases are
sw04321-A_013597-013792 more
sw04321-A_013940-014254 um tangible or
sw04321-A_015637-016598 well do you think that that th[at]- in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up
sw04321-A_018896-019105 no i'm not
sw04321-A_021479-021758 well i mean i think that
sw04321-A_021812-022372 there are many cases in our justice system where justice is not served
sw04321-A_022497-022653 say
sw04321-A_022653-022798 but um
sw04321-A_022798-023000 and i also think
sw04321-A_023000-023482 just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that
sw04321-A_023482-023659 um
sw04321-A_023659-023822 the just
sw04321-A_023822-024281 the process of picking jurors is not always objective
sw04321-B_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04321-B_000181-000649 no i've not i've been called but i had to beg off from the duty
sw04321-B_000649-000772 and you
sw04321-B_001134-001272 um
sw04321-B_001272-001654 well i was i was uh originally chosen
sw04321-B_001654-002034 primarily i think because i was a young fellow and they tend to view
sw04321-B_002034-002512 younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict i don't know why
sw04321-B_002512-002862 something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago
sw04321-B_002862-003550 yeah it's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason
sw04321-B_003550-003748 and
sw04321-B_003748-004388 they kind of liked me i looked [laughter-conser[vative]-] and all that stuff and they i don't know what they saw in me but they saw it
sw04321-B_004388-004727 but uh back to the issue is uh
sw04321-B_004841-005500 i don't know at times i feel that a unanimous decision
sw04321-B_005500-005654 is warranted
sw04321-B_005654-006001 especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun
sw04321-B_006001-006469 but there too there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule
sw04321-B_006469-006645 might be acceptable
sw04321-B_006645-007000 particularly i think in civil cases in criminal cases
sw04321-B_007000-007396 i'd like to see the unani[mity]- unanimity remain
sw04321-B_007396-007924 but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be be sufficient
sw04321-B_008405-008739 well in a criminal case say one in which
sw04321-B_008739-009370 you know there is like say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because
sw04321-B_009370-009693 by law and by constitution there must be
sw04321-B_009693-010210 proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this
sw04321-B_010210-010418 and in civil law
sw04321-B_010418-010828 there you know is such a thing as like let's say uh
sw04321-B_010930-011426 misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that
sw04321-B_011426-011675 a majority rule i think would be
sw04321-B_011675-011857 more in line
sw04321-B_011857-012168 as there is no real smoking gun
sw04321-B_012168-012317 in the civil cases
sw04321-B_012457-012734 i don't know if i'm making any sense or not
sw04321-B_014190-014543 yeah often there's more incriminating evidence
sw04321-B_014543-014836 like for instance say um
sw04321-B_014836-015452 and also too i think i'm i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious
sw04321-B_015452-015636 in a criminal case
sw04321-B_016549-016683 hm
sw04321-B_016683-016871 well
sw04321-B_016871-017088 i really can't say for certain
sw04321-B_017088-017357 truth be known um
sw04321-B_017357-018055 as it stands there's there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a [civinal/civil] uh civil and criminal case
sw04321-B_018055-018229 i mean the uh
sw04321-B_018229-018419 documentary The Thin Blue Line
sw04321-B_018419-018617 pretty much demonstrated that
sw04321-B_018617-018913 you know i don't know for if you're familiar with that or not
sw04321-B_019039-019400 uh a fellow when he was much younger um
sw04321-B_019400-019660 was tried and convicted and sentenced to death
sw04321-B_019660-020311 fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked and uh so he served out his his sentence
sw04321-B_020311-020741 until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the Thin Blue Line
sw04321-B_020741-021298 that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system the case was reopened and he was exonerated
sw04321-B_022263-022498 yeah many laws but little justice
sw04321-B_024197-024366 oh certainly not
sw04321-B_024366-024548 certainly not
sw04321-B_024548-025308 and you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will
sw04321-B_025308-025955 pretty much fulfill the lawyer's desires you know the because you get up and
sw04321-B_025955-026999 and they ask you a few questions both sides do and then you you're either challenged which is you know each attorney can use that as much as they like
sw04321-B_026999-027363 or i think it's a limit now they probably limit now
sw04321-B_027363-027768 but they pretty much go through that and
sw04321-B_027768-028353 then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve for me it was financial hardship
sw04321-B_028353-029410 so but onto the thing um i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing it was always my impression
sw04321-B_029410-029877 that the justice himself or herself had the final say
sw04322-A_000000-000449 okay national service what do you think about it i'm sorry i forg[ot]- i forgot your name already
sw04322-A_000449-000616 Lee okay Lee
sw04322-A_002058-002196 um-hum
sw04322-A_002493-002787 um-hum um well [laughter]
sw04322-A_002787-003662 you're not going to get a whole lot of disagreement from me [laughter] none of the people that i talk to on this project disagree with me very much which kind of surprises me
sw04322-A_003662-003841 [laughter]
sw04322-A_004727-004827 um-hum
sw04322-A_004934-005073 um
sw04322-A_005073-005222 hum
sw04322-A_005489-006230 well think of how much we have to pay for it i m[ean]- i'm you know i think if it's voluntary you get the people that want to be there
sw04322-A_006230-007281 they'll do well if it's mandatory you get everybody you get people that don't want to don't want to do work like that and they'll goof off or or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that um
sw04322-A_008507-008634 hum
sw04322-A_008967-009166 yeah i'm
sw04322-A_009166-010324 well think of it ye[ah]- yeah i- i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that i[f]- if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it
sw04322-A_011177-011387 well [laughter]
sw04322-A_011387-012153 [vocalized-noise] you've got you've got a far fewer number what percentage of of of people do you think now do something like that um
sw04322-A_013706-013829 hum
sw04322-A_015008-015416 well i don't [laughter] if you need the space i suppose it's cost effective because [laughter]
sw04322-A_015416-016525 you can't get along with the old with with the old one but um [noise] no i- i and it just seems to me that that that once you get everybody involved there's there's what there's eight million is it uh
sw04322-A_016525-017143 uh kids c[ollege]- uh turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now but uh
sw04322-A_017143-018157 that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive
sw04322-A_018157-019154 not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in uh i[n]- in in non market uh e[nterprises]-
sw04322-A_019154-020405 enterprises for for for a couple of years uh that's going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is going to be double there i um
sw04322-A_020405-020593 just don't see
sw04322-A_021168-021288 no
sw04322-A_021288-021323 [laughter]
sw04322-A_021323-021485 i don't know i
sw04322-A_021485-021675 [noise] i think the
sw04322-A_022883-023894 yeah uh i- i grant to that but if that's the case then it needn't the[n]- then you don't have a m[andatory]- you don't need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service
sw04322-A_023894-025107 you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anythi[ng]- gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera
sw04322-A_025414-025591 right
sw04322-A_026084-026678 that's true but but i think that was different uh in at least three respects first of all
sw04322-A_026678-027518 um it was not a mandatory program if you didn't have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it
sw04322-A_027518-028880 secondly the time of the depression was just vastly different people were not as cynical about society about government and about the nation as they are now um so they didn't react negatively as many people would today
sw04322-A_028880-029895 and thirdly the economic conditions were different it was a big drain on the Treasury during the depression as well it's not clear that it made it any easier to get out of the depression
sw04322-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04322-B_000376-000511 Lee
sw04322-B_000685-001511 oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what
sw04322-B_001694-002535 you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing
sw04322-B_003420-004329 oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to uh
sw04322-B_004329-005509 you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it's normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they won't you know everybody will just think
sw04322-B_005509-005777 this is the way things are and it
sw04322-B_007196-008528 well i'm not looking at the mandatory uh program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done i'm looking at it as a way to shape people's psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing
sw04322-B_008528-009400 of course the program would have to work or else they'll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing
sw04322-B_010472-011206 oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective
sw04322-B_012026-012847 well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because
sw04322-B_012847-013752 they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp
sw04322-B_013752-014858 not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because_1 it's cost effective or because_1 they need the space
sw04322-B_020440-021157 w[ell]- you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and that's why you're doing this
sw04322-B_021258-022103 i mean what there's sort of both excess excess bodies available to labor but then there's not enough skilled labor
sw04322-B_022103-022861 so at the same time you have too many people who want to wo[rk]- or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work
sw04322-B_024978-025520 well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC
sw04322-B_025520-026108 and uh they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and
sw04323-A_000000-000133 [noise] yeah [noise]
sw04323-A_000281-001032 uh well i don't that's a tough decision um at the moment i probably should go for something that's that's more on the practical side of things
sw04323-A_001032-001593 um so i don't know right now i drive a uh Volkswagen Golf GTI
sw04323-A_001593-002318 um and that's a great little car for me because_1 i[t's]- it's fun to drive plus you can fold the backseats down and and it's got a lot of storage room
sw04323-A_002497-002673 no huh-uh i'm single
sw04323-A_002673-002873 [laughter]
sw04323-A_003270-003432 oh wow
sw04323-A_003849-003972 um-hum

sw04323-A_010983-011385 well true true [laughter] i'm sure it doesn't hurt
sw04323-A_011385-012135 but uh yeah actually um i don't know you know that brings up the the question about uh American versus imports
sw04323-A_012135-013119 you know there's a lot of people saying buy American again you know but obviously uh neither of us would if we uh [laughter] [laughter-had] the option um
sw04323-A_013119-013501 [vocalized-noise] i guess yours is based on previous experience then maybe
sw04323-A_013501-013676 [laughter]
sw04323-A_014112-014252 um-hum
sw04323-A_014552-014691 um-hum

sw04323-A_027985-029320 ye[ah]- yeah um i don't know i always like to to look for something a little with a little more power that's tha[t's]- that's my main complaint against um like Toyota is because_1 i think they always under power their cars
sw04323-A_029320-029907 yeah um you know i mean they'[re]- they're great if if you're really looking for maximum uh
sw04323-B_000000-000282 [noise] okay so what kind of car do you want to buy next

sw04323-B_003892-005021 and um that's worn out [laughter-and] and if i would have had the money to go buy a car i would probably get a Toyota just because
sw04323-B_005021-006142 that's what everybody says i should get when i get a car is a Toyota they supposed to just last forever you know and um if i had my choice i'd want a minivan
sw04323-B_006142-006335 uh probably a Chrysler
sw04323-B_006335-007342 you know Plymouth Voyager one of them other ones you know one of them that's what i would want [noise] lots of room so
sw04323-B_007342-008334 have room for them children to you know move around and not get cramped up and fuss you know so
sw04323-B_008460-009380 but i would probably you know want something with really good gas mileage because i'm cheap [laughter] you know so
sw04323-B_009380-009815 that would probably be my choices two choices
sw04323-B_010156-010487 well you're single and you know

sw04324-A_003632-003800 oh you are
sw04324-A_004160-004332 uh all set
sw04324-A_004332-004657 okay now wh[at]- what do we do just press one and go for it
sw04324-A_004657-004909 [laughter-this] is kind of weird
sw04324-A_004909-005491 um all right um uh wha[t]- what do you want to do as a prompt for the question
sw04324-A_005622-005755 no
sw04324-A_006269-006545 oh you're a student oh okay
sw04324-A_006669-007063 uh why don't i ask you the question um you know uh
sw04324-A_007063-007255 i don't know um
sw04324-A_007255-008029 being uh d[o]- i'll just ask you know d[o]- do you think income taxes work for this country or should we have a broad base tax
sw04324-A_008208-008489 of everybody just pays a flat rate
sw04324-A_008489-008678 ten percent
sw04324-A_008678-008817 what
sw04324-A_008817-009460 okay all right i'll talk to you in a bit h[old]- okay uh i'll just press one okay here we go
sw04324-A_009460-009699 [noise]
sw04324-A_009890-010357 right i g[uess]- i guess i'm just wondering uh what your thoughts are on taxes uh um
sw04324-A_010357-011017 do you think that we should just have a kind of a broad based tax or just uh or do you like it the way it's set up now
sw04324-A_012756-012878 yeah
sw04324-A_013072-014098 well yeah i suppose that's i suppose that's true in i- i guess i'm more for kind of a just a across the board tax because that way everybody would pay
sw04324-A_014098-014789 the s[ame]- a rate that's equal to what they were doing i mean if somebody only made ten thousand dollars a year and it was a ten percent tax
sw04324-A_014789-015215 they're paying a thousand dollars whereas if somebody's making a million dollars a year
sw04324-A_015215-015575 uh you know what i mean they're paying a hundred thousand dollars in taxes
sw04324-A_015575-016304 as opposed to which what it seems like now which is you know these guys get away with uh all these tax breaks and everything else like that
sw04324-A_016304-017040 that apply to them but they don't apply to the little guys so it seems like the [vocalized-noise] all the t[axes]- you know taxes are being paid by everybody else
sw04324-A_017040-017214 seems kind of crazy
sw04324-A_017614-017738 yeah
sw04324-A_017855-018237 e[xactly]- exactly just everybody pays ten percent that's it
sw04324-A_018237-019312 and then nobody has to worry about whether you know i get this and i get that and uh you know or this person gets a tax break but this person doesn't when this person makes that much more money
sw04324-A_019312-019916 i mean that way you know somebody that's uh that's making uh ten million dollars pays a million bucks in taxes
sw04324-A_019916-020595 they um uh see i guess the problem with that is are they really using their fair share
sw04324-A_020719-021075 of the person that pays that many that much more taxes
sw04324-A_021188-021533 but then again they have as much use to the of the system as everybody
sw04324-A_022028-023095 i don't know if that that would make sense i guess uh i guess what people do i guess the government's incentive now is to create incentives so that people will do more i guess house building or
sw04324-A_023095-023944 buying homes or you know because of they give them br[eak]- tax break on their interest because_1 i have a break on our interest i mean all our our all our mortgage interest is deductible
sw04324-A_023944-024578 um but it doesn't seem like they do a damn good job with the uh uh with the way they're spending the taxes
sw04324-A_024868-025045 exactly
sw04324-A_025045-025644 i mean they only just recently got rid of the interest uh that was deductible on credit cards and car loans and things like that
sw04324-A_025644-026206 yeah but the major borrowing is still there i mean you know on mortgages and things like that
sw04324-A_026206-026718 uh although i don't think that we could afford our house without having that uh mortgage deduction
sw04324-A_026718-027107 um you know it actually cuts down four hundred bucks a month
sw04324-A_027455-027895 i don't know that's a good question i- i don't know whether they did or not
sw04324-A_029425-029580 [laughter-right]

sw04324-B_011897-012384 uh taxing them a little more i mean those people who can afford to pay it out i mean there
sw04324-B_012384-012772 it wouldn't be fair to um like with say lower class people who don't make as much money
sw04324-B_012772-013141 to uh pay out the same amount of taxes as someone making millions of dollars

sw04324-B_027982-028759 yeah you're uh trying to get back at trying to sort of maybe punish i don't know the rich and make them pay some more but
sw04324-B_028759-029144 it what happened wa[s]- the the result was that uh

sw04325-A_007097-007524 i don't envy anybody who's in [laughter-that] situation to find day care
sw04325-A_007524-007888 but does your sister live in a big community
sw04325-A_008799-008944 um-hum

sw04325-A_011227-011382 how lucky [laughter]
sw04325-A_011382-012173 i- i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but
sw04325-A_012173-013356 the community i'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them [laughter] to get
sw04325-A_013356-013722 to yeah to get references and that so
sw04325-A_013722-013876 but um
sw04325-A_013876-014074 i i do[n't]-
sw04325-A_014074-014584 don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but
sw04325-A_014584-014927 simply because_1 there's so many kids and so many
sw04325-A_014927-015035 [noise]
sw04325-A_015187-016152 yeah and um you know colds and things [laughter-like] [laughter-that] get spread real easy and things but and they're expensive and
sw04325-A_016152-017003 course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things
sw04325-A_017003-017475 or they just watch them and let them_1 play and things like that but
sw04325-A_017475-017817 take a long time to find the right place [laughter]
sw04325-A_018261-018391 um-hum
sw04325-A_018491-018615 um-hum
sw04325-A_019059-019474 um-hum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah
sw04325-A_019867-020469 um-hum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around
sw04325-A_020469-021050 but um seems like you know go[lly]- what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or
sw04325-A_021050-021367 you know at the wrong time [laughter] but
sw04325-A_021501-021642 um-hum
sw04325-A_021642-021956 well when you have kids will you work
sw04325-A_021956-022158 do you work now
sw04325-A_022158-022312 um-hum
sw04325-A_023062-023213 um-hum
sw04325-A_023341-023783 um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home
sw04325-A_023783-023987 so i'm here all the time
sw04325-A_024632-024754 uh-huh
sw04325-A_024754-024900 yeah
sw04325-A_024900-025064 yeah
sw04325-A_025064-025223 so
sw04325-A_025458-025890 not it depends on the state you live actually some laws
sw04325-A_025890-026931 absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet
sw04325-A_026931-027010 [laughter]
sw04325-A_027010-027441 say that and i'm not a certified teacher i went to college but i
sw04325-A_027441-028075 you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now
sw04325-A_028075-028261 and so
sw04325-A_028261-028608 one of them_1 was for a couple of years
sw04325-A_028608-029020 and so you know my oldest
sw04325-A_029020-029431 he was and then my youngest two have never been
sw04325-A_029431-029590 so
sw04325-A_029590-029856 anyway but we don't
sw04325-B_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04325-B_000322-000455 i guess
sw04325-B_000692-000875 i think um
sw04325-B_000875-001060 i wonder if that worked
sw04325-B_001300-001549 i think it usually does you might try um
sw04325-B_001549-001716 i don't know hold it down a little longer
sw04325-B_001909-002000 [noise]
sw04325-B_002613-002746 okay i
sw04325-B_002907-003290 well i don't remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess
sw04325-B_003290-003492 we can start um
sw04325-B_003597-004401 no i don't i don't have any kids i um my sister has a she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was
sw04325-B_004401-004867 worrying about going back to work and what she was gonna do with him and
sw04325-B_004867-005177 the different do you have kids
sw04325-B_005177-005352 oh really
sw04325-B_005352-005471 [laughter]
sw04325-B_006256-006397 um-hum
sw04325-B_007448-007582 yeah
sw04325-B_007845-008873 um yeah she lives it's a it's a fairly large community she um got real lucky though she had a boss who um moved into a larger office
sw04325-B_008873-009202 and she's able to take her baby to work with her
sw04325-B_009303-009570 and it's a small office that she works in
sw04325-B_009570-009733 and um
sw04325-B_009733-010668 it's a it's a legal firm office and it's just one lawyer and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there
sw04325-B_010668-011131 and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her
sw04325-B_011131-011232 [laughter]
sw04325-B_011844-011980 yeah
sw04325-B_013237-013487 yeah so it's fairly safe
sw04325-B_014970-015260 worried that they're not going to get enough attention
sw04325-B_015602-015735 yeah
sw04325-B_016950-017077 yes
sw04325-B_017784-018090 yeah and you and you don't always even know if it's it's
sw04325-B_018090-018319 gonna be the right place or not
sw04325-B_018319-018557 anything i guess could happen
sw04325-B_018557-018718 because after
sw04325-B_018718-019129 i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care
sw04325-B_019231-019594 yeah when when he's not when she can't
sw04325-B_019594-019937 keep control of him and he starts crawling that's
sw04325-B_020421-020548 um-hum
sw04325-B_021003-021154 [laughter]
sw04325-B_021154-021303 yeah
sw04325-B_021303-021582 i think she has problems with that too
sw04325-B_021967-022295 i don't know that's something i've considered um
sw04325-B_022414-022703 i always kind of think it would be neat to
sw04325-B_022806-023168 be able to watch them_1 and be there for them_1 all the time
sw04325-B_023168-023367 is that what you do
sw04325-B_023987-024266 oh so they don't go to school is it like um
sw04325-B_024266-024498 oh what's that called it's a
sw04325-B_024498-024820 correspondence school they do it at home
sw04325-B_024950-025436 that's interesting do you have to have any special training
sw04325-B_027316-027457 um-hum
sw04325-B_028089-028371 so they haven't been to public schools at all
sw04325-B_029391-029610 hm
sw04325-B_029739-029856 so you've never had
sw04326-A_000000-000385 [noise] do you feel about the issue of uh random or spot drug testing
sw04326-A_000963-001118 um-hum
sw04326-A_005369-006122 yeah i- i tend to believe that that it's it's important for those jobs where uh
sw04326-A_006122-007163 where the the person has the safety of other people uh in their own hands or within their control then i think it should be mandatory
sw04326-A_007163-007759 you know the the airline industry the transportation industry um you know the uh
sw04326-A_007759-008334 the defense and military you know any any application like that i think it should be mandatory
sw04326-A_009136-009259 right
sw04326-A_009785-009912 um-hum
sw04326-A_010730-010932 yeah

sw04326-A_015619-015747 right
sw04326-A_015960-016945 yeah y[ou]- you you know you can easily envision the one one mistake could you know ruin a a career that couldn't be uh you know couldn't be resurrected
sw04326-A_018218-018343 yeah
sw04326-A_019138-019260 no
sw04326-A_020053-020183 [laughter-yeah]
sw04326-A_020468-020595 yeah
sw04326-A_021299-021421 yeah
sw04326-A_022364-022484 right
sw04326-A_022871-022999 yeah
sw04326-A_023152-023306 right
sw04326-A_023306-023441 huh
sw04326-A_023554-023716 yeah definitely
sw04326-A_023910-024396 yeah i don't really feel like you know for any any of the
sw04326-A_024396-024915 just routine jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy
sw04326-A_024915-025039 um
sw04326-A_025162-025476 only for the only for the ones where it's critical
sw04326-A_026988-027144 right
sw04326-A_027144-027267 right
sw04326-A_028181-028584 yeah i- i guess i would feel that the you know police
sw04326-A_028584-028657 [noise]
sw04326-A_028657-029480 uh that the police should be one of those public uh safety issues where you know [laughter-mandatory] drug testing where it would be favorable
sw04326-A_029480-029602 uh
sw04326-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04326-B_000331-000829 well i'm i'm for it based upon my experience uh in taking
sw04326-B_000829-001263 uh drug tests my uh my past experience in the military
sw04326-B_001263-001847 plus uh my current occupation working uh for a defense contractor here in Massachusetts
sw04326-B_001847-002118 uh i feel that it's uh
sw04326-B_002118-003075 there is some opinions whereas the uh uh people of the mind that uh it's a right to privacy that
sw04326-B_003075-003478 you know it's a it's a bodily function involved and that um
sw04326-B_003478-004061 um people should have a right to protect themselves and so forth but i don't agree i think that
sw04326-B_004061-004623 um it's important particularly for some jobs and some [jog/job] o[ccupations]- job occupations
sw04326-B_004623-005297 that um people can be screened for uh should be screens for uh for drugs through uh drug testing
sw04326-B_007100-007223 um-hum
sw04326-B_007498-007632 right
sw04326-B_008257-008418 yeah
sw04326-B_008418-009890 so i think we're in agreement that that uh uh that it's a good uh it's a good idea in some circumstances the one reservation i have though in that from my exper[ience]- i've taken many urina[lysis]- many drug tests
sw04326-B_009890-010383 some of them random some of them um scheduled
sw04326-B_010383-010853 uh and every time you take one of those tests [laughter-you] [laughter-know] when you're submitting a sample
sw04326-B_010853-011392 there's always in the back of your mind well how are you know people conducting the test
sw04326-B_011392-012602 the labs that are performing the test how adequate uh are those facilities and uh is is always it is it always a chance i know that what they call um the i think it's called the chain of custody
sw04326-B_012602-013750 of the uh the specimens themselves i know in the mi[litary]- in the military particularly they there's a they go to great lengths at protecting the samples before they get to the labs
sw04326-B_013750-014341 but my concern is and i think that that that what needs to be further investigated
sw04326-B_014341-015122 is the uh the standardization and to have some hundred percent insurance that the test that's given
sw04326-B_015122-015947 uh the the the lab that performs the uh the analysis is uh validated in some way you know some standardization because_1 i've heard some horror stories
sw04326-B_015947-016085 you know
sw04326-B_016085-016251 [noise]
sw04326-B_016994-017609 Sixty Minutes did an article on this whole subj[ect]- subject a few uh a few years ago and there was a Air Force Captain
sw04326-B_017710-018282 who uh you know took the test and it came up positive [noise] and the guy swore on a stack of bibles
sw04326-B_018282-019223 now in the military for a for a staff staff NCO which is a a noncommissioned officer but it's a certain rank above i don't know if you're familiar with mil[itary]- military rank structure
sw04326-B_019223-020169 it's a it's a high level of enlisted personnel and officers for those people who show up positive on one drug test they're immediately discharged
sw04326-B_020169-021004 now for certain ranks and below like sergeant and below if you're found positive or come up dirty in a dru[g]- on a on a drug test
sw04326-B_021004-021640 you can be reduced in rank forfeit your pay or if it's a repeat repeat o[ffense]- uh offense
sw04326-B_021640-021828 [noise] then they can discharge you
sw04326-B_021828-022065 but there's this Ar[my]- this this
sw04326-B_022065-022431 Air Force Captain he swore up and down that he didn't do anything
sw04326-B_022431-022500 [noise]
sw04326-B_022500-023231 and they went back and you know few months later to try to investigate the lab and the sample that he had given was destroyed
sw04326-B_023231-023874 so i- i think you got to be careful with stuff like that that's that's my only concern about the whole issue i think
sw04326-B_024862-024984 yeah
sw04326-B_025442-025597 um-hum
sw04326-B_025597-026431 uh yeah because_1 there's a big thing in in the in the here on the east coast the Boston Police Department uh the Policemen's Association
sw04326-B_026431-027204 took the uh the Boston Police Department to court because they were uh trying to institute drug tests for the cops here in Boston
sw04326-B_027204-027659 and um they won the Police De[partment]- the the Police Association won
sw04326-B_027659-027764 [noise]
sw04326-B_027764-028186 and i[t]- it was a right to privacy type deal that they approached it and the courts agreed
sw04326-B_029059-029200 yeah
sw04326-B_029200-029382 oh yeah
sw04326-B_029382-029898 definitely well you know the thing is is in all these transportation accidents this
sw04327-A_000000-000199 [noise] right uh actually i
sw04327-A_000199-001072 lived over in Europe for a couple of years i lived in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system what they do is they have uh three judges basically
sw04327-A_001072-002250 and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not
sw04327-A_002753-002921 [laughter]
sw04327-A_004723-004868 uh-huh
sw04327-A_005659-005810 wow
sw04327-A_006636-007579 well you know it's it's one of those things i mean uh uh i would have to look at that if they did it with the uh
sw04327-A_007579-008408 just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
sw04327-A_008408-009317 because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say i'm sorry you can't
sw04327-A_009317-010135 use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldn't have this uh
sw04327-A_010135-011296 uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no d[isregard]- disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know [laughter]
sw04327-A_011639-011874 [noise] that may very well be
sw04327-A_012018-012194 uh that's a
sw04327-A_015372-015503 yeah
sw04327-A_015662-015900 that's true you do have a
sw04327-A_016000-016318 [noise] well how would you go about changing it
sw04327-A_016649-017130 [laughter] leave the details up to somebody else huh
sw04327-A_018423-018559 yeah
sw04327-A_018826-019299 well you know uh talking about the lawyers
sw04327-A_019299-020223 you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to
sw04327-A_020223-021176 set the fees for cases it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh VCR or television repair if you take your TV in
sw04327-A_021176-021727 a lot of these TV repair places will say well i'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars
sw04327-A_021727-022350 and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it
sw04327-A_022350-023452 then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know i'll repair your your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars
sw04327-A_023452-023995 gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars
sw04327-A_023995-025273 so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case and that's it none of this
sw04327-A_026084-026224 oh yeah
sw04327-A_026385-026513 yeah
sw04327-A_026665-026871 that's true yeah
sw04327-A_026871-027521 um y[eah]- well you you know [laughter] you're talking to part of them that's paying for that [laughter]
sw04327-A_027521-028431 [laughter] that's right you know that's it it's it's amazing and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges th[ey're]- they're all former lawyers
sw04327-A_028922-029235 [laughter]
sw04327-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04327-B_002180-002837 [noise] ou[r]- ou[r]- our judicial system is in such total chaos
sw04327-B_002837-003232 i think what they need to do is they need to somehow
sw04327-B_003334-003462 take
sw04327-B_003462-003918 the money out of it i mean when you have a man that's signed a
sw04327-B_004079-004814 a a statement saying he's guilty we have a a family called all day family they were all murder[ers]-
sw04327-B_004814-005731 all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since i was a child
sw04327-B_005731-006671 and what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever
sw04327-B_011164-011691 uh that's true i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
sw04327-B_011691-012246 i i hold it in the utmost contempt the uh
sw04327-B_012246-012562 th[e]- th[e]- my favorite is
sw04327-B_012562-013597 the police department [noise] they're not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and i
sw04327-B_013597-014897 we have work schedules we can be called at work we have Social Security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones and we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them
sw04327-B_014897-015426 they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check
sw04327-B_015426-015739 so where do you think they target their efforts
sw04327-B_015739-016171 they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals
sw04327-B_016274-016939 [noise] you know that's a i've nailed the problem down but i [laughter]
sw04327-B_016939-017462 yeah i'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about i think to begin with
sw04327-B_017621-018495 you would h[ave]- you would have like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets
sw04327-B_018495-019065 i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from
sw04327-B_025130-025590 now i i firmly believe in that because when you get the most
sw04327-B_025590-026756 heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford
sw04327-B_026756-026951 who's paying for that
sw04327-B_027222-027806 [laughter] yeah and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it [laughter]
sw04327-B_028390-028959 yeah well that's another problem i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it
sw04327-B_028959-029195 [laughter] i mean they're
sw04327-B_029195-029962 they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you you could expect that you
sw04328-A_000000-000870 [noise] community i'll start we have a lot of uh we we've started doing some and uh in in uh we live in a suburb of Chicago
sw04328-A_000870-001791 recycling has become somewhat in vogue we've always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin
sw04328-A_001791-002680 but it's totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pa[ins]- places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these
sw04328-A_002680-004071 but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation which is uh you have to now pay for each trash bag that that the garbage man picks up you have to pay a dollar and a half
sw04328-A_004071-005136 and we uh you have to buy a sticker uh and it and it costs a dollar and a half and you have to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you don't have that sticker on there then the garbage man won't pick it up
sw04328-A_005136-005623 now that's that that's for regular trash if you have recyclable trash
sw04328-A_005623-006585 like newspapers or right now it's limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles then they'll pick that up for free
sw04328-A_006585-007442 so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable bin
sw04328-A_007442-008384 or recyclable uh container they they give you one of these then that that doesn't cost anything so that encourages people to participate
sw04328-A_008568-008698 [laughter]
sw04328-A_008836-008972 [laughter]
sw04328-A_010979-011107 uh-huh
sw04328-A_013995-014130 right
sw04328-A_015984-016109 uh-huh
sw04328-A_018053-018212 oh no
sw04328-A_020748-020998 so like somebody messed up
sw04328-A_021126-021451 a strategic miscalculation on their part
sw04328-A_022799-023358 so it's totally voluntary even if you pay your dollar and a half you don't you you can still put everything in the trash
sw04328-A_024374-024448 [laughter]
sw04328-A_024448-024787 any idea how many people are going to do it are going to do it
sw04328-A_025016-025137 okay
sw04328-A_025327-025598 so some of the people will go along with it anyway
sw04328-A_026138-026265 yeah
sw04328-A_026570-026783 well [noise]
sw04328-A_028519-028648 yes
sw04328-B_000000-000088 [noise]
sw04328-B_005152-005298 i would
sw04328-B_008337-009588 well that's makes sense ours seems really crazy because well we've had the places all the shopping centers i mean the local shopping centers where there's a grocery store and
sw04328-B_009588-010511 you know drug store and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans
sw04328-B_010511-011643 that type of thing for uh oh the Kiwanis or some sort of groups pick them up and make a little money for their causes and those are fairly popular and work fairly well
sw04328-B_011643-012374 and you can also take your own stuff to a recycling center and you know get the few pennies you get for the papers or cans
sw04328-B_012374-012956 i know some people who do that but to me that too much trouble for the few cents
sw04328-B_012956-013707 the uh so i just drop it off at the local place when i go to the store and let them
sw04328-B_013707-015070 you know some good agency make some money off of it what little they get and uh that works for me but now as i understand it from reading the paper the system seems totally backwards
sw04328-B_015070-016065 uh they are starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and a half a month
sw04328-B_016065-017343 and that's because they will give us containers you know certain colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in that all makes sense
sw04328-B_017343-018074 but if you don't want to recycle you can say i don't want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month
sw04328-B_018074-019037 which the theory is that if you don't want to recycle with the city who actually has a private contractor do it
sw04328-B_019037-020023 uh if you don't recycle with the city then you're going to take it yourself and you know make your money off of your paper and cans
sw04328-B_020023-020673 somehow it seems to me like people will just say i don't want to pay the buck and a half and i'll throw it in the garbage
sw04328-B_020673-020835 so
sw04328-B_020945-021298 it sounds to me like it's messed up but they've had
sw04328-B_021415-022670 i guess so we'll have to see what happens they're just supposed to start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and different kind different colors for different things
sw04328-B_022670-022816 uh
sw04328-B_023260-024423 you still could so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and i think i understand it pretty well from both the paper and TV and we'll see what happens
sw04328-B_024423-024570 uh
sw04328-B_024733-025043 oh supposedly the majority are
sw04328-B_025043-025370 it's pretty ecologically conscious here
sw04328-B_025526-026214 oh i think so plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a half and not even notice the difference or care
sw04328-B_026214-026407 but uh
sw04328-B_026407-027749 it seems strange now at the university where i work it's uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them
sw04328-B_027749-028596 and uh there is a campus recycling bins not bins but like i work in a library
sw04328-B_028596-029280 and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different types of things but they're in staff areas
sw04328-B_029280-029952 but we have wanted to have specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines
sw04329-A_000000-000255 [noise] okay so i guess it starts recording now
sw04329-A_000363-000904 i don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the Saginaw area
sw04329-A_000904-002135 um-hum and i'm not real familiar with uh anything that i i[n]- fact the far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery story or [laughter-anything] in this area yeah
sw04329-A_004787-004953 uh-huh
sw04329-A_005607-005737 really
sw04329-A_005737-006530 that is pretty good i'm we're originally from another state and i know in the state we were from that they did that ty[pe]- similar type thing the city brought out
sw04329-A_006530-007102 you know se[parate]- tra[sh]- separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know
sw04329-A_007607-008759 i don't really know i don't really know they they started after we moved down here and so i i'm not really familiar i just know that and my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up but i don't know if they get a
sw04329-A_008759-009079 get anything back on it or do you get money for it
sw04329-A_009532-009676 oh
sw04329-A_009812-010124 [laughter-really]
sw04329-A_010797-010968 right
sw04329-A_011236-011673 right and now now most of them_1 are th[e]- throwaway [laughter]
sw04329-A_011673-012054 a[nd]- yeah i think now they're a lot more expensive than that um
sw04329-A_012054-012370 i bought some Cokes the other day in the br[ead]- the little bottles
sw04329-A_012370-012636 you know and i think the bottles were like
sw04329-A_012636-013660 i know they were at least ten cents apiece i was trying to figure out how i was like God how much were those [laughter-bottles] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and it was they come in like uh eight an[d]- and eight and ten packs you know
sw04329-A_013660-014743 instead of six packs and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] [laughter-was] [laughter-like] [laughter-God] [laughter-Almighty] costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes

sw04329-B_002808-003185 putting the i think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling
sw04329-B_003185-003773 dumpsters and things like that which i[t]- now i guess the uh city h[as]- has bought these
sw04329-B_003773-004114 big green trash cans and uh
sw04329-B_004114-004471 we they have a recycling truck that comes around now
sw04329-B_004471-004751 and you separate your glass and
sw04329-B_004751-004894 paper
sw04329-B_004894-005117 and uh aluminum
sw04329-B_005117-005721 and you set it out and they pick it up and i[t]- it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response
sw04329-B_005721-005900 but
sw04329-B_007039-007166 did they
sw04329-B_007166-007467 did they like on bottles did they give you a
sw04329-B_007467-007709 so many cents back for
sw04329-B_007709-007924 for cans even i've seen that i[n]-
sw04329-B_008035-008175 really
sw04329-B_009037-009436 no i've just i noticed in Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel
sw04329-B_009436-009603 per aluminum can
sw04329-B_009603-009864 so you don't see too many thrown out around the [laughter-streets]
sw04329-B_009864-010256 even bottles you know all kinds of bottles they they
sw04329-B_010256-010849 they really charge people to uh i guess when you purchase them_1 and and then when you turn them_1 back in
sw04329-B_010849-011106 i know i remember the old days as a kid where
sw04329-B_011106-011302 a bottle was a nickel an[d]-
sw04329-B_011302-011474 [vocalized-noise]
sw04329-B_011474-011893 right so maybe that's one thing they could do to
sw04329-B_012256-012430 um-hum
sw04329-B_012987-013201 well that's
sw04329-B_013633-013759 right
sw04329-B_014670-015194 that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle [laughter-area]
sw04329-B_015194-015620 it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but but it's uh
sw04329-B_015620-016057 it's quite they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut
sw04329-B_016057-016228 of green
sw04329-B_016228-016499 wi[th]- the green glass yeah it's amazing
sw04329-B_016840-016974 uh-huh
sw04329-B_017631-017766 [noise] right
sw04329-B_018622-019025 right yeah it's i notice the plastics have sort of
sw04329-B_019025-019344 faded away the milk jugs it it's
sw04329-B_019344-019950 people just they they really don't uh there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
sw04329-B_019950-020597 yeah it's i don't know it it can be it's not as easy [laughter]
sw04329-B_020597-020978 collecting you know clean junk as they say
sw04329-B_021225-021440 [laughter] that's right that's right
sw04329-B_021440-021780 it's like washing the dishes before you put them_1 in the dishwasher [vocalized-noise]
sw04329-B_021780-021976 we all do it [laughter]
sw04329-B_021976-022208 [noise] well it was nice talking to you
sw04329-B_022425-022900 well i think i think two or three minutes is fine an[d]- yeah
sw04329-B_023794-023917 right
sw04329-B_024147-024459 oh we're doing it for a church choir so
sw04329-B_024459-024632 yeah so [noise]
sw04329-B_024632-024963 [noise] well thank you bye bye
sw04329-B_024963-025138 [noise]
sw04330-A_000000-000418 [noise] well uh does the company you work for test for drugs
sw04330-A_002304-002448 huh
sw04330-A_002448-002792 uh no we're not being tested for drugs at all uh
sw04330-A_002792-004044 our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal it says use of narcotics on company premises
sw04330-A_004044-005100 so [noise] that's pretty general but um i work for an environmental management firm [noise] and i'm an engineer there but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites but i don't operate any machinery
sw04330-A_005100-005952 now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like [noise] that are under a a medical monitoring program because they're
sw04330-A_005952-007452 at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and i- i think that drugs they do test for drugs in that capacity but it's not their exclusive it's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for [noise]
sw04330-A_007452-008579 but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company's business
sw04330-A_011025-011167 huh
sw04330-A_014900-015061 oh really
sw04330-A_016214-016762 right [noise] we that's been an a an issue uh
sw04330-A_016762-018206 in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll [laughter] have these little parties and people will just get i mean i've my brother lives near where i work and i have many a time called him to come get me you know and um
sw04330-A_018206-018563 uh but y[ou]- you know they don't think twice about serving
sw04330-A_018563-019198 beer by the keg you know but um i think drug testing and i- i don't know
sw04330-A_019198-020140 i guess i c[an]- i think it's got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think you know in your case i don't think that
sw04330-A_020140-021145 you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing i think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
sw04330-A_024115-024248 um-hum
sw04330-A_028561-028689 oh [noise]
sw04330-A_028957-029123 right [noise]
sw04330-B_000000-000111 [noise]
sw04330-B_000334-001490 actually um they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because_1 w[hen]- when i went to work for them um they didn't do that but uh since then they've they've started a
sw04330-B_001490-002372 drug testing policy not because of their own um convictions but because the clients of our company are requesting that we do that
sw04330-B_002372-002493 how about_1 you
sw04330-B_003524-003667 uh-huh
sw04330-B_004036-004165 hum
sw04330-B_004443-004595 [laughter-okay]
sw04330-B_005074-005198 yeah
sw04330-B_005449-005579 uh-huh
sw04330-B_007371-007504 yeah
sw04330-B_008495-009254 well it's actually uh we do oil well services so a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies and they go out to [noise]
sw04330-B_009254-010264 we have engineers who uh go out to the oil well [noise] to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff so the clients are very concerned that
sw04330-B_010264-011099 you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because_1 they're on their their you know territory and everything but
sw04330-B_011099-012479 the thing that's interesting is that i w[ork]- i'm an engineer and a software engineer and i work in the software uh house and everybody there you know are all software engineers they've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything and
sw04330-B_012479-013548 yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh th[e]- all the engineers have to to well a little different actually but um you know we have to go through the same thing and it's
sw04330-B_013548-014963 but it's uh it's a little different i guess than than a lot of drug policies in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away
sw04330-B_014963-016337 other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly [laughter-like] um we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and tha[t]- they didn't find any problem with that you know but
sw04330-B_016337-016492 um
sw04330-B_018722-018862 [laughter-yeah]
sw04330-B_020387-020518 yeah
sw04330-B_021027-021294 yeah it's really it's really bizarre
sw04330-B_021294-022601 uh particularly like where we are you know i- there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle and she she was a personnel secretary and she [laughter] had to get tested
sw04330-B_022601-023275 and i don't know i'm ambivalent about the whole thing i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if
sw04330-B_023275-024195 you know they're they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway
sw04330-B_024195-024343 but um
sw04330-B_024343-025707 i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job that where i had to um uh do a drug test and and it's it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through and it amounted to
sw04330-B_025707-027175 um going in uh before any of these interviews i'm not even working for this company i'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and and uh before i went in to any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know
sw04330-B_027175-027717 and um actually bec[ause]- beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening
sw04330-B_027717-028153 but i had forgotten about that and so basically i'd already peed off in that morning and
sw04330-B_028153-029279 and when i got in there i didn't i wasn't like able to give a full sample and so they made me sit and wait for forty five minutes drink a whole ton of water before [laughter] i went to any of the interviews
sw04330-B_029279-030106 and go in there again and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating you go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you
sw04331-A_000000-000381 [noise] John i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment how about you
sw04331-A_001101-001604 well uh do you think it should just be restricted to certain crimes
sw04331-A_003500-003618 [laughter]
sw04331-A_003618-004311 well there are those that say it's not a deterrent to others but i think it certainly deters the one [laughter-that] uh
sw04331-A_004311-004495 gets the capital punishment
sw04331-A_006537-006664 yeah
sw04331-A_007355-007479 that's
sw04331-A_007560-007905 that's true well certainly Texas uh
sw04331-A_007905-008657 as a state believes in capital punishment i don't know i wonder if we execute more people than other states or
sw04331-A_012408-012739 yeah i think so too uh
sw04331-A_012739-013257 and and we fail so miserably in rehabilitating any kind of criminal
sw04331-A_013257-014038 and i- i don't know i wonder if there are other crimes uh a repeated rapist for example or
sw04331-A_014038-014151 [noise]
sw04331-A_014151-014563 uh i don't know kidnapping of course is a
sw04331-A_014563-014753 capital crime
sw04331-A_014753-014881 but i
sw04331-A_015025-015160 i doubt that
sw04331-A_015261-015382 i
sw04331-A_015382-015571 i don't know
sw04331-A_015719-015900 don't know
sw04331-A_015900-016391 i think so but maybe not maybe not i could be confused what do i know [laughter]
sw04331-A_016391-016542 [laughter]
sw04331-A_016542-016775 i'm not a kidnapper [laughter]
sw04331-A_016993-017242 well there've been a few over in
sw04331-A_017242-017530 in i g[uess]- i not recently i guess
sw04331-A_018698-018860 that's right
sw04331-A_018920-019607 w[ell]- i certainly don't agree with a with a murderer getting a sentence of twenty years and being out in seven or whatever it is
sw04331-A_019607-019894 i think that's just totally inappropriate
sw04331-A_022848-023569 yeah you don't uh so you don't think that cap[ital]- that capital punishment is appropriate for repeated robber or
sw04331-A_025537-025658 no uh
sw04331-A_026158-026296 yeah
sw04331-A_026296-027502 i- i don't know what the consensus in the state is i know it was it was a few years ago that the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment didn't they didn't they tell the states to go back and review the circumstances
sw04331-A_028183-028401 something like that they
sw04331-A_029703-029826 yeah
sw04331-B_000000-000309 [noise]
sw04331-B_000309-000607 i am i yes and uh
sw04331-B_000709-001223 uh what was the first part of the uh subject that you [vocalized-noise]
sw04331-B_001498-001918 oh i- i basically do i think uh
sw04331-B_001918-002878 other than murder uh the probably uh i don't think there's a need for it if uh if it's not if the case is doesn't involve murder
sw04331-B_002878-003325 i don't see any need for it in anything else any other circumstances
sw04331-B_003325-003623 i guess it's an eye for an eye
sw04331-B_004083-004218 oh
sw04331-B_004218-004378 yeah
sw04331-B_004378-004989 well yeah i guess the other argument is that you might execute the wrong person but uh
sw04331-B_004989-005955 i don't know i just think the chances of that happening are pretty slim of course it's [laughter] it's not reversible uh obviously but uh i just think the way the system is set up uh
sw04331-B_005955-006635 the chances of the wrong person being executed are are really very small uh
sw04331-B_006635-007585 uh i've served on a few juries and they take a they seem to take a lot of care to make sure they've got the uh the right person whatever for the conviction levied
sw04331-B_007827-007932 [noise]
sw04331-B_008146-008274 um-hum
sw04331-B_008630-009618 i don't know you every once in a while if you hear [vocalized-noise] if there's some who's fairly famous or notorious being executed in another state you read about it or hear about it but uh
sw04331-B_009618-010909 i don't know how we rank up there with the other states but uh i think it's a deterrent i- i don't i mean it wouldn't be a deterrent for everybody obviously but i think uh if it uh
sw04331-B_010909-012285 if it saves one person's life it may be worth it uh if one person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it
sw04331-B_012285-012452 but i think it's a deterrent
sw04331-B_012568-012684 [noise]
sw04331-B_013047-013209 um-hum
sw04331-B_013209-013387 right and
sw04331-B_013812-013961 yeah
sw04331-B_014778-014914 w[ell]-
sw04331-B_014914-015552 is that uh is that punishable by death in Texas or is that up to the jury to decide or the judge
sw04331-B_015552-016023 i never thought about that but is that is that a capital crime
sw04331-B_016023-016140 huh
sw04331-B_016354-016534 [laughter]
sw04331-B_016534-017152 don't hear much about don't hear much about kidnapping anymore kidnaps uh
sw04331-B_017492-018763 but the uh the whole judicial system is a mess like you said there's no rehabilitation in the prisons and so they get out of prison and they're they're back to doing what they were doing before they went to prison
sw04331-B_018763-018944 they haven't learned a lesson
sw04331-B_019526-019773 um-hum yeah
sw04331-B_019773-020899 yeah well like you said rape uh that there's a possibility there for uh capital punishment and that that's a serious enough crime that uh it maybe warrant capital punishment
sw04331-B_020899-021784 but what gets me is the uh i may be getting off the subject somebody might get forty five years for stealing i mean for robbing something
sw04331-B_021784-022451 of course that i think to get that they'd have to be a repeat offender that'd be more than one or two cases involved
sw04331-B_022451-023017 but the the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided messed up
sw04331-B_023462-023849 no no i really don't uh
sw04331-B_023849-024529 no murder and again rape possibly a repeated uh rapist may be uh
sw04331-B_024529-025310 a candidate for capital punishment but uh the really serious stuff i don't this burglary and robbery and
sw04331-B_025310-026166 uh that sort of thing even if they're multiple offenders or repeat offenders i- i wouldn't condone capital punishment for that
sw04331-B_027396-028253 yeah yeah that uh it was it was uh there was no capital punishment for a long time there i don't know fifteen twenty years maybe
sw04331-B_028253-028706 and uh i know when i was growing up there was uh there were a lot of uh
sw04331-B_028706-029760 electrocutions up in Sing Sing up in New York upstate New York and then uh they did away with like you said Supreme Court outlawed it and then it came back on a state by state basis
sw04331-B_029760-029971 but uh
sw04332-A_000000-000018 [noise]
sw04332-A_000018-000717 well i guess there's a lot of uh complex issues here some of which are moral and some are um
sw04332-A_000717-000748 [noise]
sw04332-A_000748-001157 more logistical as to the merits capital punishment
sw04332-A_001157-001481 i suppose the uh the moral ones are
sw04332-A_001582-002173 are the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones i guess are
sw04332-A_002173-002983 uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not
sw04332-A_002983-003689 um not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that
sw04332-A_003689-004578 now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though
sw04332-A_005444-005655 yeah yeah
sw04332-A_005842-005973 yep
sw04332-A_006561-007556 yeah those are all good ones i suppose uh another one is um if you do decide that it's uh you know you want to do this
sw04332-A_007556-008139 is somebody capable of making the judgment rationally you know do we have the um
sw04332-A_008139-008809 do we really have that ability to go out and judge somebody's crime all these circumstances and other stuff and weigh it
sw04332-A_008937-009862 can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it it's like uh like nuclear power plants you know it's a great idea
sw04332-A_009862-010369 but logistically we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to
sw04332-A_012180-012433 um yeah yeah
sw04332-A_012433-012605 yeah exactly
sw04332-A_013416-013661 yeah or shouldn't
sw04332-A_013661-013818 shouldn't be using it
sw04332-A_014025-014626 there's a lot of can'ts and shouldn'ts and don'ts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days
sw04332-A_014763-014927 um
sw04332-A_015377-016290 [laughter] well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so
sw04332-A_016290-016550 uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where
sw04332-A_016550-017080 something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it it's just kind of like in one ear and out the other
sw04332-A_017080-017437 some state recently executed somebody where was that Texas
sw04332-A_018066-018652 yeah what kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for murders big murders
sw04332-A_018855-018981 yeah
sw04332-A_019400-019730 yeah what did they uh give Jeffrey Dahlmer
sw04332-A_019730-019940 what did they do to him
sw04332-A_020274-020521 uh that would make too much sense
sw04332-A_020659-021310 yeah yeah seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody that was so rare
sw04332-A_021310-021534 something kind of wasteful
sw04332-A_021534-021727 [noise] not that um
sw04332-A_021727-022056 not that we need more or anything like that
sw04332-A_022056-022375 [laughter]
sw04332-A_022375-022563 yeah that was a bizarre case
sw04332-A_022563-023101 and i g[uess]- are they did the government federal government pass some recent um
sw04332-A_023101-024149 regulation something about for ce[rtain]- certain crimes uh if um there's a gun involved or something like that the death penalty is automatic or is there something like that out there
sw04332-A_025071-025211 yeah
sw04332-A_025729-025857 yeah there's some real
sw04332-A_026332-026498 yeah
sw04332-A_026498-026976 they're they're often does seem to be backlash against light things
sw04332-A_026976-027800 i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh Jim Bakker getting forty five years
sw04332-A_027904-028583 that's that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i don't know if they changed it
sw04332-A_029436-029660 [laughter]
sw04332-A_029660-029853 yeah
sw04332-B_000000-000131 [noise]
sw04332-B_004650-005574 oh yeah i guess it has to do with uh what anger revenge
sw04332-B_005574-006360 oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody
sw04332-B_008619-009009 you mean do we have the right or are you talking logistical here
sw04332-B_010310-011614 well that i think you can take that nice simple nice simple [laughter] nice problematical logistical argument and say well are you morally able to make a mistake
sw04332-B_011614-012293 you know what what is uh is it all right to guess wrong once in a while
sw04332-B_012428-013087 and if it's if it's not acceptable to ever make a mistake you know ever sentence somebody to death that shouldn't be
sw04332-B_013087-013457 then uh you can't use the death penalty
sw04332-B_013659-013954 well yeah okay
sw04332-B_015068-015411 so what are they doing down in uh Georgia
sw04332-B_017484-017623 oh
sw04332-B_017623-017654 [noise]
sw04332-B_017654-017881 i haven't heard about any lately
sw04332-B_017881-018170 uh Florida was doing a few weren't they
sw04332-B_018412-019504 uh yeah usual serial killers or multiple murders like if uh you know somebody kills a family or
sw04332-B_019812-020338 didn't they lock him away in a uh psychological ward
sw04332-B_020338-020800 no no they didn't they didn't they just le[t]- sent him to prison that's right
sw04332-B_021961-022190 [laughter]
sw04332-B_024118-025137 uh well there's something like that and there's always proposals to uh make punishment nastier
sw04332-B_025137-026403 you know or whenever somebody gets off lightly somebody visible gets off lightly they you know the judge has what like a range of sentences he can give like three to ten
sw04332-B_026511-026693 and he gets the
sw04332-B_028616-029194 yeah there's a general impression that uh these snakes get off eventually
sw04332-B_029194-029498 uh like Klaus Von Bulow
sw04332-B_029667-029853 who will i guess
sw04333-A_000000-000603 [noise] Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think
sw04333-A_003557-003717 uh-huh
sw04333-A_003717-003983 see i never thought really it's uh [noise]
sw04333-A_003983-005142 i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little i i always thought that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment
sw04333-A_005142-006412 for instance like Social Security tax or Soc[ial]- uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
sw04333-A_006412-007277 that's yeah i you know when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that money's history
sw04333-A_007277-008031 and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back
sw04333-A_008031-009296 uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in DC that are researching to find a cure for polio
sw04333-A_009411-010686 which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet
sw04333-A_011329-011468 uh-huh
sw04333-A_011942-012603 well that might be the difference i don't know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with
sw04333-A_012603-013371 it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
sw04333-A_013371-013975 that that histor[ical]- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything
sw04333-A_013975-014752 seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians
sw04333-A_016451-016605 uh-huh
sw04333-A_017401-018003 so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto
sw04333-A_020021-020146 yeah
sw04333-A_020948-021095 uh-huh
sw04333-A_022724-022995 yeah pork barrel politics
sw04333-A_024703-025333 yeah but Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
sw04333-A_025333-025721 uh-huh i mean i don't know i
sw04333-A_026691-026990 [laughter]
sw04333-A_026990-028156 it's uh i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
sw04333-A_028156-029053 or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
sw04333-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04333-B_000579-001387 well that's [laughter] that's a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um
sw04333-B_001387-002565 [noise] i let's example uh o[ur]- our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has
sw04333-B_002565-003688 tax and fee increases so uh i know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward now i[n]- in terms of economics i'm not it's hard hard to call it really is
sw04333-B_006339-006556 hm right [laughter]
sw04333-B_006556-007278 [noise]
sw04333-B_007278-007467 yes uh
sw04333-B_010660-012004 well yeah i'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio i'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing somebody who has already gotten polio
sw04333-B_013333-013462 right
sw04333-B_014785-015933 yeah it's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is been trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of
sw04333-B_015933-016801 uh funny amendments for individual uh c[ongressional]- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals and
sw04333-B_016801-017355 the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing
sw04333-B_017798-017940 uh
sw04333-B_017940-018542 i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh
sw04333-B_018542-019488 the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh
sw04333-B_019488-020086 uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things
sw04333-B_020086-020749 [laughter] right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment
sw04333-B_020749-021694 [noise] there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa[ctly]- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is
sw04333-B_021694-022783 so i'm not i'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh i forgot there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something
sw04333-B_022783-023746 uh pork barrel politics the[re]- the[re]- there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh
sw04333-B_023746-024748 we[ll]- i- i lived in Massachusetts for a while and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular
sw04333-B_025226-025402 but at least at the end
sw04333-B_025575-026783 yeah i- i- they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out
sw04333-B_028974-029962 and spare the economy yeah it's really it's a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business um i know some
sw04334-A_000000-000198 type of music is hot down in Texas
sw04334-A_001387-001602 oh okay [noise]
sw04334-A_001602-001872 uh mostly folk music
sw04334-A_001872-003175 yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
sw04334-A_003469-003625 okay
sw04334-A_004424-004564 uh-huh
sw04334-A_004844-005173 yeah what about uh classic rock type stations
sw04334-A_005431-005579 oh okay
sw04334-A_006085-006369 so some some of the older Eagles stuff was good
sw04334-A_006369-006728 i i didn't like uh they started getting a little more
sw04334-A_006728-007423 you know the type of music a[t]- at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes
sw04334-A_007423-007994 but uh some of their older s[tuff]- stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me
sw04334-A_007994-008313 you know Ho[tel]- Hotel California and that era
sw04334-A_008609-008737 yeah
sw04334-A_009449-009896 well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
sw04334-A_009896-010197 i'm s[ure]- i'm sure there's a lot of that down there
sw04334-A_010360-010518 [laughter]
sw04334-A_010897-011749 well there there's a Conway Twitty twang then there's the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound type
sw04334-A_011945-012075 yeah
sw04334-A_012855-013232 yeah i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts
sw04334-A_015096-015518 hey i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks
sw04334-A_015518-016281 but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message
sw04334-A_016672-017258 yeah and i don't i don't think gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say
sw04334-A_018063-018195 uh-huh
sw04334-A_019357-019486 right
sw04334-A_019817-019948 right
sw04334-A_020257-020397 uh-huh [laughter]
sw04334-A_020628-020990 yeah i[t]- i[t]- it's the artist not the merit
sw04334-A_021723-021852 yeah
sw04334-A_022140-023243 well i don't know i know for myself that uh for the most part i don't know which artist is which so i listen to a song i either like the song or i don't like it and then if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was
sw04334-A_024400-024846 well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist an[d]-
sw04334-A_025386-025515 yeah
sw04334-A_025807-026191 yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop
sw04334-A_026767-026954 yeah
sw04334-A_027608-028377 yeah see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey
sw04334-A_028377-029012 and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a d[emo]- an album
sw04334-A_029012-029281 and so if you like the artist you buy the album
sw04334-A_029281-029547 so you definitely get to try before you buy
sw04334-A_029669-029962 though it you you you don't always quite get it right
sw04334-B_000104-000931 uh well i don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas i know what's hot down here with me so that's about all i can feel
sw04334-B_000931-001502 apt to discuss with you since i just know i don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's hot around here so
sw04334-B_001502-001681 so what kind of music do you like
sw04334-B_001784-001952 folk music
sw04334-B_003125-003521 uh-huh well we're on totally different wavelengths
sw04334-B_003521-004479 i'm i'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type
sw04334-B_004479-004670 you know uh
sw04334-B_004670-005028 Van Halen that kind of thing [noise] any
sw04334-B_005028-006115 uh i don't listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so uh classic rock for me is what i have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix
sw04334-B_006115-006268 uh
sw04334-B_006268-006426 yeah
sw04334-B_007322-007535 yeah yeah
sw04334-B_007899-008132 yeah well it's
sw04334-B_008234-008633 yeah yeah that does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really
sw04334-B_008633-009577 so yeah definitely uh so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music something i might know of i don't know any folk music at all
sw04334-B_009797-010096 yeah oh yeah we hear [laughter]
sw04334-B_010096-010443 oh plenty way way more than i can stand down here
sw04334-B_010443-010512 [laughter]
sw04334-B_010512-010961 i i don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it i
sw04334-B_011633-012983 yeah yeah that's more even more commercialized form of country music but uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as i see it Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so it's
sw04334-B_013113-013798 yeah it's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western singers is
sw04334-B_013798-014061 it's it's quite quite odd but
sw04334-B_014061-015271 uh i don't know it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think it's it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know it's it['s]- it's
sw04334-B_015419-015637 yeah and that's all it's it's
sw04334-B_015740-015865 yeah
sw04334-B_015969-016187 yeah that's what it it was
sw04334-B_016187-016826 yeah that's what what you say and and then music is wrapped around now now it's the other way around they just
sw04334-B_016826-017058 [noise]
sw04334-B_017173-017807 no no they don't have anything really important you want to hear but you know it's kind of odd it's like
sw04334-B_017807-018586 it doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know you hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that
sw04334-B_018586-019412 you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do
sw04334-B_019412-019875 more than anything Madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know
sw04334-B_019875-020685 Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now but
sw04334-B_020888-021751 yeah exactly so i don't know i i don't know that that's i don't think that's a good thing at all but that's [laughter] that's what the point we've reached so i don't know
sw04334-B_021751-022225 how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
sw04334-B_022781-022909 yeah you
sw04334-B_023127-024469 yeah yeah that's about how i am on popular music i don't you know you don't i don't know enough about it because i just listen uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio so
sw04334-B_024775-025471 uh i yeah i just mostly buy along the same lines all the time i don't really switch around to new things very often
sw04334-B_025471-025943 it's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing it's
sw04334-B_026134-027191 uh yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard and i listen to it that way but
sw04334-B_027191-027653 as far as yeah i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it
sw04334-B_028290-028410 yeah
sw04334-B_029215-029352 yeah
sw04334-B_029475-029773 yeah yeah that's definitely i that's
sw04335-A_000000-000291 all right [laughter]
sw04335-A_000291-001078 [laughter] they're pretty good they um you know i can't they're no[t]- they're they're a good team you know
sw04335-A_001078-002322 uh but uh i think uh i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people they've been trading or anything
sw04335-A_002726-002876 yeah
sw04335-A_003000-003138 yeah
sw04335-A_003434-003619 [laughter]
sw04335-A_004672-004808 yeah
sw04335-A_005175-005442 [laughter] [noise]
sw04335-A_005442-005722 oh yeah they
sw04335-A_005722-005885 yeah
sw04335-A_005997-006179 [laughter]
sw04335-A_006179-006688 [vocalized-noise] but most of them_1 are what over six foot aren't they [noise]
sw04335-A_007067-007409 and two hundred and some pounds [laughter]
sw04335-A_007918-008149 yeah he's [vocalized-noise]
sw04335-A_008149-008704 he's one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot
sw04335-A_008704-009176 but but uh he's one of the taller ones
sw04335-A_009176-009363 uh
sw04335-A_009803-009925 huh
sw04335-A_009925-010240 that's a good question [laughter]
sw04335-A_010364-011082 well they might be i haven't really heard [vocalized-noise] who they been uh trading or anything but uh
sw04335-A_011082-011999 they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so
sw04335-A_012475-012614 yeah
sw04335-A_012971-013131 um-hum
sw04335-A_013131-014419 oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know
sw04335-A_014419-014962 and they've done that every season every year for a while [laughter]
sw04335-A_015323-015856 oh he's getting up there in the years i don't know if he's gonna stick around or not you know
sw04335-A_016294-016605 uh yeah yeah it's that uh
sw04335-A_016605-017059 i can't think of his name now but he's on defensive
sw04335-A_017059-017617 yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so
sw04335-A_017722-017940 yeah i think so
sw04335-A_017940-018130 uh
sw04335-A_018398-019223 uh [laughter] i really don't even keep up with the college teams that much you know
sw04335-A_019223-019734 i'm just basically pro teams you know basically
sw04335-A_020113-020257 yeah
sw04335-A_020359-020494 yeah
sw04335-A_020494-020632 uh
sw04335-A_020781-021670 oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday n[ights]- Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are reserved for me [laughter]
sw04335-A_022488-022712 yeah well
sw04335-A_023000-023212 [laughter]
sw04335-A_023212-024216 well i kind of let her watch every now and then i'll let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over i'll turn it to the last quarter like on Monday nights
sw04335-A_024216-024374 so
sw04335-A_024590-025269 i think some of it's pretty good and some of it's not so good you know i kind of go either way on it
sw04335-A_025783-025922 yeah
sw04335-A_027380-027673 oh yeah that's kind of
sw04335-A_027673-028686 yeah that's just like a couple of them_1 instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit and stuff this last year and i think that's what's gonna hurt them_1 from having it
sw04335-A_028821-029005 but uh
sw04335-A_029005-029544 but i don't know Dallas is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year
sw04335-B_000000-000579 [noise] okay well how about those Redskins huh [laughter]
sw04335-B_001004-001137 yeah
sw04335-B_001837-001977 do you think
sw04335-B_002271-003087 uh yeah they had[n't]- i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um i've i've got three kids who collect football cards
sw04335-B_003087-003505 so they uh they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards
sw04335-B_003505-004085 and uh actually we went to after they won the uh the uh Super Bowl
sw04335-B_004085-005565 we actually went down to the mall in uh Washington and saw uh you know all the players down there and they had a big rally down there and so it was surprising how big those guys were i mean they they look big on the field but they're even bigger in person though
sw04335-B_005565-005786 especially_1 that guy Joe Jacobi
sw04335-B_005786-006262 he's just a guy's a monster i mean he's not inhuman
sw04335-B_006262-006402 but uh
sw04335-B_006565-007247 oh yeah they're all they're all huge guys i mean a small guy would be about six three and
sw04335-B_007247-008174 yeah R[ypien]- Rypien you know for a quarterback Rypien was six i think he was six three or four and two thirty which is really big
sw04335-B_008626-008753 um-hum
sw04335-B_009086-009221 yeah
sw04335-B_009221-009879 well uh what t[eam]- what team are you predicting uh will come out of the AFC next year
sw04335-B_009879-010008 you know
sw04335-B_010112-010404 you think Denver will be as tough as they were this year
sw04335-B_011650-011798 yeah other than
sw04335-B_011957-013016 yeah well i was real surprised uh that they did as well as they did last year i didn't realize that they were as good as they were and actually i thought they probably should've beaten Buffalo
sw04335-B_013016-013252 in the uh title game but
sw04335-B_014296-014427 um-hum
sw04335-B_014824-015311 um-hum [noise] you think Mecklinburg is gonna hang around for another season or is uh
sw04335-B_015715-016422 yeah didn't they have a guy on there uh th[e]- wasn't a uh deaf player on there this year
sw04335-B_016853-017114 was it D[avis]- Davis or something like that
sw04335-B_017470-017804 yeah i think he isn't he from Nebraska
sw04335-B_017804-017941 yeah
sw04335-B_018073-018284 what kind of college teams do you like
sw04335-B_018452-018778 Cornhuskers right [laughter]
sw04335-B_019141-019272 uh-huh
sw04335-B_019692-020460 yeah i kind of run out of steam uh until right near the the bowl games with all the colleges then i then i watch all the bowl games but
sw04335-B_020460-020848 yeah does your wife let you watch uh plenty of football
sw04335-B_020848-021060 really [laughter]
sw04335-B_021415-022581 oh [laughter-r[eally]-] [laughter-that's] [laughter-pretty] [laughter-good] yeah i usually uh i'm getting more and more into that habit but after ten years i still haven't been able to get into the habit of of just having that time reserved but
sw04335-B_022581-023259 last year last year was pretty good i got she cut me a lot of slack so i could actually watch some football [laughter]
sw04335-B_024138-024287 um-hum
sw04335-B_024287-024554 what do you think of the instant replay rule
sw04335-B_024934-025061 [noise] uh-huh [noise]
sw04335-B_025189-025859 [noise] what i can't believe is you know there are certain plays i guess that they don't use a instant replay on
sw04335-B_025859-026486 and you'll see you know the most flagrant you know foul or something else you know
sw04335-B_026486-027544 and uh they just don't you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs
sw04335-B_028514-028649 um-hum
sw04335-B_028649-028867 yeah yeah
sw04335-B_029027-029171 which
sw04335-B_029333-029466 yep
sw04335-B_029466-029779 well yeah they really uh they really mauled the Ski[ns]-
sw04336-A_000000-001156 [noise] uh well i'm not sure how it is in Georgia but in in Pittsburgh the r[ate]- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for Atlanta
sw04336-A_002750-003314 yeah i th[at's]- that's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere
sw04336-A_003836-005010 well uh fr[om]- least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences what's more likely to occur is uh
sw04336-A_005010-005468 robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store
sw04336-A_005468-006569 or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh
sw04336-A_006569-007945 cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
sw04336-A_007945-008404 but mostly petty things and no[thing]- no[thing]- nothing nothing really too big
sw04336-A_009297-009433 right
sw04336-A_011640-011779 um-hum
sw04336-A_012200-013401 yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened lets about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
sw04336-A_013401-014131 it was a freestanding machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
sw04336-A_014131-014398 now there's a crime for you [laughter]
sw04336-A_014398-015317 yeah but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what i hear in the news and and
sw04336-A_015317-015777 i- i s[aw]- saw an episode of the TV show Cops
sw04336-A_015777-016128 uh one time that was in Pittsburgh and uh
sw04336-A_016128-016642 it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that
sw04336-A_016642-017697 but i- i don't really think those things ha[ppen]- happen too often because li[ke]- like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
sw04336-A_019014-019138 yeah
sw04336-A_021059-021183 yeah
sw04336-A_022102-023049 you know i- i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment right now i'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and uh
sw04336-A_023049-024339 the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out [laughter] you know and things like that
sw04336-A_024339-025439 uh i[t]- it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when they're not just come in
sw04336-A_025439-026740 you know there's a TV and a VCR and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music it it could still happen then
sw04336-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04336-B_001029-001393 Atlanta is kind of high uh
sw04336-B_001393-002822 it's it's lower than it has been in the past uh i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher
sw04336-B_003232-003372 yeah
sw04336-B_003372-003937 uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into any [pacifits/specifics]
sw04336-B_007869-008026 um
sw04336-B_008331-009386 right well i guess here we run into that sometime but i guess a lot of crimes are done with uh apartment type break-ins you know
sw04336-B_009386-009988 that type not much home break-ins there are some but not not very high
sw04336-B_009988-011170 uh as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either th[ere]- there were one case where uh this one guy uh was
sw04336-B_011170-012279 taking women from the teller and and you know making them_1 give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them_1 also so it's kind of like a double assault there
sw04336-B_012279-012404 [noise]
sw04336-B_013356-013501 really
sw04336-B_013840-013967 um-hum
sw04336-B_014071-014257 oh wow
sw04336-B_014257-014480 [laughter-there] [laughter-is] [laughter-a] [laughter-crime]
sw04336-B_015712-015862 uh-huh
sw04336-B_017647-017892 oh okay
sw04336-B_017892-019072 hm i don't know crime situations here they like i say a lot of a lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break-ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs
sw04336-B_019072-019652 or drug related you know in in most cases it's not like uh
sw04336-B_019652-021133 if someone do steal a a television or VCR or something like that it is for drugs you know because_1 you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know you gonna only get ten or fifteen bucks for it
sw04336-B_021133-022154 so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist
sw04336-B_023433-023604 right
sw04336-B_024180-024412 yeah um-hum
sw04336-B_025248-025393 um-hum
sw04336-B_026134-026284 um-hum
sw04336-B_026672-027270 yeah that's true but you be surprised also how [vocalized-noise] much people watch you that even uh
sw04336-B_027270-028310 uh participating in any type crime i guess there was one case i was surprised uh so happen this person worked at the same place i work for Georgia Tech
sw04336-B_028310-029464 and they work at the same place i did but i didn't know that they had been watching me because i was getting ready to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is
sw04336-B_029464-029885 uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know like shock
sw04337-A_000000-000034 [noise]
sw04337-A_000034-000155 well
sw04337-A_001316-002165 well um i believe a trial by twelve uh peers is fair i don't think the need for a unanimous vote is fair
sw04337-A_002165-002489 nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote
sw04337-A_002489-002677 except that
sw04337-A_002677-003238 hm we're too uh diverse a cultures i believe to make a
sw04337-A_003238-003442 complete agreement
sw04337-A_004446-004586 i do
sw04337-A_004586-004759 i really do
sw04337-A_008233-008400 i agree with that
sw04337-A_010799-011939 i agree i think that's very true i'm um concerned that when we uh sentence a uh a criminal to for a certain amount of years that we don't really know what that means
sw04337-A_011939-012275 you know ten years may mean one year in reality
sw04337-A_012275-012636 and i don't think that most people are aware of that
sw04337-A_012636-013232 you know i i wouldn't couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long he'd actually be in jail
sw04337-A_013232-013362 could you
sw04337-A_013362-013522 me either
sw04337-A_013522-013870 and i think they kind of depend on that these criminals
sw04337-A_014084-014206 but it
sw04337-A_015784-015912 um-hum
sw04337-A_016440-016822 definitely would but i see where they would be experts
sw04337-A_016822-016961 um
sw04337-A_018364-018811 right it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack
sw04337-A_018811-019039 what if one of them is corrupt
sw04337-A_019039-019510 and he is the the decision the the main decision maker
sw04337-A_019510-019846 you know the the they're split either way
sw04337-A_020127-020332 it does but
sw04337-A_020332-020666 that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-way]
sw04337-A_020666-020884 [laughter]
sw04337-A_020884-021262 and who gets to point those people the politicians [laughter]
sw04337-A_021262-021356 [laughter]
sw04337-A_021356-021598 so they get to make the decision not the people
sw04337-A_021598-021656 [laughter]
sw04337-A_022977-023101 um-hum
sw04337-A_024962-025839 that's true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for [vocalized-noise] children
sw04337-A_025839-026545 on up i mean i kn[ow]- i know that we all learned but i really don't see it where the children are learning it nowadays
sw04337-A_026545-026914 they think it's a big game and you know
sw04337-A_027496-028001 are are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay or a week's pay
sw04337-A_028001-028237 is your boss willing to let [laughter-you]
sw04337-A_028442-028573 yeah
sw04337-A_029139-029304 oh definitely
sw04337-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04337-B_000240-000587 so uh what do you think about uh
sw04337-B_000587-001297 uh how trials in America are right now with the jury of nine or twelve do you think that's fair
sw04337-B_002061-002187 um-hum
sw04337-B_002432-002559 uh-huh
sw04337-B_003394-003541 um-hum
sw04337-B_003541-004508 so you think that um majority r[ule]- majority rule is good enough for um deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty
sw04337-B_004508-004629 um-hum
sw04337-B_004730-005888 um something that's kind of interesting is uh i lived in Europe for a while and um in Germany they don't have trial by jury they have trial uh by
sw04337-B_005888-006109 usually three judges
sw04337-B_006109-006155 [noise]
sw04337-B_006155-007484 and uh i've discussed with people and it's it's kind of interesting uh kind of an interesting concept it sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers but then um the argument for it
sw04337-B_007484-007656 is that
sw04337-B_007656-007849 um you know
sw04337-B_007849-008255 people off the street really don't know much about law
sw04337-B_008255-008592 and yeah and and then uh
sw04337-B_008592-009906 i guess the argument is that they're easily influenced you know by by tricks by lawyers you know who [dos/do] do more psychology than trying to teach them what's right and wrong and the law they they use uh
sw04337-B_009906-010189 you know techniques to sway their feelings whereas
sw04337-B_010189-010333 professional
sw04337-B_010333-010457 judges
sw04337-B_010457-010578 um
sw04337-B_010578-010842 you know know the ins and outs of the system better
sw04337-B_011889-012013 um-hum
sw04337-B_012213-012336 right
sw04337-B_012437-012469 [noise]
sw04337-B_012574-012700 um-hum
sw04337-B_013157-013300 uh-huh
sw04337-B_013300-013449 no
sw04337-B_013449-013593 no couldn't
sw04337-B_013816-013949 right
sw04337-B_013949-014774 yeah definitely i don't know i think the that the um alternative is something interesting to look into uh
sw04337-B_014774-015072 if y[ou]- you know instead of
sw04337-B_015072-015421 instead of juries just by by uh
sw04337-B_015421-015823 uh peers juries by professional judges
sw04337-B_015823-016120 um but i guess uh
sw04337-B_016120-016451 that would take a major constitutional change here [laughter]
sw04337-B_016734-017756 right um i mean i see also how they were you know when they made the constitution they were uh afraid of that kind of thing that you know that um if the
sw04337-B_017756-018403 government has all the power to decide who's guilty and who's not they wanted to make checks and balances against that
sw04337-B_018943-019141 right exactly
sw04337-B_019429-019562 right
sw04337-B_019804-020199 yeah it's uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way
sw04337-B_020587-021051 right [laughter] that's true too you know how does how does that work
sw04337-B_021174-021330 right [laughter]
sw04337-B_021463-022681 exactly i think it was i think it was more of a danger you know in the seventeen hundreds when um really you know like the King of England could decide who's guilty and who's not guilty i could see how they would
sw04337-B_022681-023570 wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing
sw04337-B_023570-023693 uh
sw04337-B_023693-025048 you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they're not or vice versa you know um but it's definitely something that would have to be watched very [laughter-closely] if they decided to do it that way
sw04337-B_025555-025681 exactly
sw04337-B_025789-025912 um-hum
sw04337-B_026447-026578 right
sw04337-B_026850-027501 right and and um you know what what does jury duty mean not not many people really
sw04337-B_027501-027627 uh-huh
sw04337-B_027762-027936 [laughter]
sw04337-B_028140-028691 right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people
sw04337-B_028691-029220 [vocalized-noise] another interesting thing is you know m[ost]- m[ost]- most people try and get out of jury duty right
sw04337-B_029220-029885 so the people that actually become juries are it's not really just a random sampling of the
sw04338-A_000000-000016 [noise]
sw04338-A_000016-000322 so Cathy um do you keep a monthly budget
sw04338-A_003069-003201 um-hum
sw04338-A_004947-005100 wow
sw04338-A_005448-005570 hum
sw04338-A_006550-006681 do you have any kids
sw04338-A_007489-007657 well i can hear him right there
sw04338-A_008259-008502 so how does that work into your budget
sw04338-A_008502-008791 as far as planning for expenses and so forth
sw04338-A_011882-012253 hum until they you wouldn't happen to work for Liberty Mutual would you
sw04338-A_012253-012396 Liberty Mutual
sw04338-A_012396-012568 [laughter-okay]
sw04338-A_012568-012917 that that's [vocalized-noise] my company and that's exactly what we have
sw04338-A_012917-013048 [noise]
sw04338-A_014572-014694 um-hum
sw04338-A_018078-018203 um-hum
sw04338-A_018709-019377 yeah this is uh the first year that actually the first month that i've actually instituted a budget uh for my wife and i
sw04338-A_019377-020259 for the previous nine years or so we've just pretty much let it slide um there really wasn't much problem as far as income versus expenses
sw04338-A_020259-020485 uh things are getting a little bit tighter
sw04338-A_020485-021531 uh we bought a house last year we bought a new vehicle things that which weren't a problem before have have all sudden we noticed our cash flow is starting to decline a little bit
sw04338-A_021531-021795 you know with all the monthly bills and uh
sw04338-A_021795-022273 uh so far it's working out pretty well you know we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week
sw04338-A_022273-022852 but like i said being one of the first months we really won't know for a few more months down the road how well we're doing
sw04338-A_022852-023270 but your plan where you you submit bills that's the most
sw04338-A_023270-023727 itemized plan i've ever seen or heard anyone talk about as far as married couples
sw04338-A_023842-024001 interesting
sw04338-A_025307-025440 um-hum
sw04338-A_026351-026490 fair enough
sw04338-A_029433-029636 [laughter]
sw04338-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04338-B_000265-001516 well we we do of sorts it's not a it's not a family budget both my my husband and i work and what we do is basically treat each income as separate uh
sw04338-B_001516-002489 partly we didn't want to fall into the trap of arguing over the family money oh yeah well you know i earned this much and therefore i have the right to spend that
sw04338-B_002489-003103 and well you know you overspent the the total budget this way each of us knows what's in our own bank accounts
sw04338-B_003103-003885 so you can if you want to write a check for somebody's birthday present you don't have to worry about the other person seeing it that sort of thing
sw04338-B_003885-005080 but uh what's unique is that uh my husband keeps a spreadsheet of uh the income and he submits a bill to me every month an itemized bill and i pay that
sw04338-B_005080-006534 and then so he has track of both of our expenses i pay part of the utilities he pays part of the utilities it takes a little bit more work but it does work for us i mean i[t]- it really does work very successfully for us
sw04338-B_006642-006996 yes i'm [laughter-i] am juggling one right now on my lap
sw04338-B_006996-008399 uh we have a uh almost one he he'll be one on on April second you can hear him and the one is four and he's off taking a bath [laughter] so uh yeah we've got two kids and uh
sw04338-B_008399-008635 uh well what
sw04338-B_008737-009662 well in terms of of immediate expenses like clothing um i purchase those out of my income and i get reimbursed
sw04338-B_009662-010672 fifty percent of that by my husband so again i submit bills to him [laughter] receipts to him uh for the day care uh what we do is actually take that directly out of my income
sw04338-B_010672-011742 um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so
sw04338-B_011742-012063 um that that helps f[or]- for that planning
sw04338-B_012212-012729 excuse me no no no a a biotech company as a [laughter-matter] of fact
sw04338-B_012836-013539 yeah and it it works out it works out really well now in terms of long term like college expenses
sw04338-B_013539-014624 uh right now we don't have something that's set up that's labeled college we have uh more along the lines of um uh sort of investment plans in each of the children's names
sw04338-B_014624-015781 and they were set up as as first birthday presents or or or even newborn presents from the grandparents just you know the the actually assembled and set up
sw04338-B_015781-016151 uh all the investment decisions are are now ours
sw04338-B_016151-016999 but in terms of retirement that's the one area that that is is still a little sticky because yo[u]- yo[u]- you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies
sw04338-B_016999-017608 and we spent so much time trying to to make sure that the boys are okay [laughter] that
sw04338-B_017608-018627 an[d]- you know for our own retirement there's not a whole lot actually organized but we do have uh the things through our companies so that's that's a start anyway
sw04338-B_019289-019428 um-hum
sw04338-B_019428-019819 [noise]
sw04338-B_020669-020827 um
sw04338-B_021480-021654 [noise]
sw04338-B_022795-022924 um
sw04338-B_023540-023677 yeah
sw04338-B_023677-024807 well it's not it's not actually too bad once you get the s[preadsheet]- the spreadsheet set out by my husband has categories for things like utilities uh you know other expenses
sw04338-B_024807-025362 uh the rent and my contribution i don't make as much financially as he does
sw04338-B_025362-026509 so my contribution is prorated it doesn't come it doesn't come fifty percent out of my pocket when i don't make fifty percent of the income uh you know which is nice it's fair
sw04338-B_026509-027334 uh so actually what it what happens is that we gather all the bills and then write them down and then uh
sw04338-B_027334-028481 w[ell]- uh after that it's just a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates you know i mean it it takes the percentage that's necessary and he prints out a bill and i write a check and that's it
sw04338-B_028481-028852 um once it's set up it works it works reasonable well
sw04338-B_028852-030023 so i[t]- it most of my friends though when they find out about it the[y]- the[y]- they think your husband submits a bill to you that's that's that's weird [laughter] that's really weird but we don't i mean i
sw04339-A_000000-000790 yeah Jonathan uh y[ou]- you s[ay]- you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something you're contemplating i take it
sw04339-A_000978-001100 ah
sw04339-A_001374-001512 uh-huh
sw04339-A_001812-001929 uh
sw04339-A_002271-002412 uh-huh
sw04339-A_002939-003176 wow [laughter] you get
sw04339-A_003371-003930 uh-huh what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next
sw04339-A_004281-004409 um-hum
sw04339-A_004799-004931 uh-huh
sw04339-A_005317-005450 right
sw04339-A_005962-006101 uh-huh
sw04339-A_006354-007204 well i think the next car we get will probably be a [noise] well i- i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven
sw04339-A_007204-007992 and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and a four door because
sw04339-A_007992-009450 it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them_1 stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and
sw04339-A_009450-009893 safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car
sw04339-A_009893-010031 uh
sw04339-A_010031-010875 you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it
sw04339-A_010875-011886 right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they s[aid]- they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age
sw04339-A_012332-012468 um-hum
sw04339-A_013120-013293 right
sw04339-A_013293-014032 i uh i drive a a truck a Ford truck i i like trucks because they're spacious and
sw04339-A_014032-014855 it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to
sw04339-A_014855-015555 move some members of the family or do this or that it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one [noise]
sw04339-A_015854-017060 traction uh not really um you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway [laughter]
sw04339-A_017728-017857 wow
sw04339-A_018392-018532 hm
sw04339-A_019314-019507 uh-huh
sw04339-A_019507-019843 what kind of what make is the mini van
sw04339-A_019843-020073 Mazda i see
sw04339-A_020786-020923 uh-huh
sw04339-A_021220-021343 right
sw04339-A_022006-022140 um-hum
sw04339-A_022482-023225 one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager i guess
sw04339-A_023225-024228 and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll
sw04339-A_024228-025541 be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
sw04339-A_026377-027091 uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue
sw04339-A_027568-027700 um-hum
sw04339-A_028213-028428 uh-huh
sw04339-A_028955-029082 right
sw04339-B_000000-000107 [noise]
sw04339-B_000718-001459 uh fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family
sw04339-B_001459-002347 and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago it's got a uh five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run
sw04339-B_002347-003050 and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so
sw04339-B_003050-003451 i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years when i can
sw04339-B_003879-005102 well [noise] since i just turned forty i'm thinking [laughter-about] a forty year old man's car's something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh
sw04339-B_005102-006267 the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room
sw04339-B_006267-006450 how about_1 you
sw04339-B_007137-007262 uh-huh
sw04339-B_008615-008740 sure
sw04339-B_010329-010457 sure
sw04339-B_011795-012400 yeah i'm surprised to hear that the V-8s are coming back uh they've got some pretty powerful 6s
sw04339-B_012400-012576 and uh
sw04339-B_012576-013185 you know V-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
sw04339-B_015181-015303 sure
sw04339-B_015559-016001 is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of
sw04339-B_016798-017763 [laughter] actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van
sw04339-B_017763-018780 a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and
sw04339-B_018780-019623 this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that haven't had any problem since
sw04339-B_019759-019929 it's a Mazda
sw04339-B_019929-020409 and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh
sw04339-B_020409-021282 driveability fuel economy isn't great being a minivan but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and
sw04339-B_021282-022532 it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them_1 around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
sw04339-B_022820-022943 uh-huh
sw04339-B_023177-023300 right
sw04339-B_025535-026500 yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
sw04339-B_026898-027628 uh [noise] i'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra
sw04339-B_027628-029019 and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway
sw04339-B_029019-029847 so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
sw04340-A_000000-000041 [noise]
sw04340-A_000041-000575 what kind of crime do you think um is the most prevalent in our society
sw04340-A_001280-001532 such as New York City
sw04340-A_001532-001695 [laughter]
sw04340-A_003675-003860 yeah i i
sw04340-A_003860-004915 i wonder if um if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it and even though just using is not really
sw04340-A_004915-005140 i mean it is a crime
sw04340-A_005890-006021 well that's true
sw04340-A_006021-006594 but i was i i was s[taying]- staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors
sw04340-A_006594-007155 and uh drug use well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but
sw04340-A_007155-007619 um what kind what kind have you been uh
sw04340-A_007619-008132 have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
sw04340-A_008908-009420 that that's not that much i mean you know those aren't i
sw04340-A_010134-010611 yeah i think it is i in some ways it's almost worse than murder
sw04340-A_010611-010749 um
sw04340-A_010749-011209 murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to
sw04340-A_011209-011644 b[ut]- you know i mean it is a rather final solution [laughter-though]
sw04340-A_012215-012348 yes
sw04340-A_012348-013617 what d[o]- what do you think is uh is an appropriate um punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
sw04340-A_014118-014301 i agree with that
sw04340-A_014556-014851 yeah i think Virginia does too up here
sw04340-A_015716-016082 yeah i think the appeal process takes too long
sw04340-A_016082-016915 i think i i think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
sw04340-A_017266-017394 um-hum
sw04340-A_018123-018737 well yeah i mean the system isn't perfect i mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
sw04340-A_018737-019484 you do the best you can to make it perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
sw04340-A_019484-019833 but i think you have to accept some of the errors
sw04340-A_019833-020498 i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment
sw04340-A_020498-020766 um for murderers
sw04340-A_021935-022416 and society probably too i mean just general society to
sw04340-A_022416-022551 um
sw04340-A_022551-022994 yeah it does and and it decreases the prison population
sw04340-A_022994-023261 and which is significant i mean
sw04340-A_023488-023629 yeah
sw04340-A_024695-025242 yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that um are not premeditated
sw04340-A_025242-025848 i mean they can be but usually they aren't they're spur of the moment and uh
sw04340-A_025848-026543 the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those
sw04340-A_026543-026996 those individuals i think that you you end up with a uh
sw04340-A_027163-028319 uh how do i want to you end up with a s[omeone]- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
sw04340-A_028475-028829 yes they they would have no problems doing it again
sw04340-A_028931-030061 um-hum and i think locking them_1 up for you know fifty years doesn't do uh any good because as a as a taxpayer i'm going to pay you know one and a
sw04340-B_000000-000105 [noise]
sw04340-B_000607-001046 oh boy probably uh robberies
sw04340-B_001046-001280 people stealing from each other
sw04340-B_001470-002591 [laughter] is that what happens up there a lot uh th[at's]- that that's mostly what i hear about is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen that's the most prevalent crime uh
sw04340-B_002591-002812 the ones that really
sw04340-B_002812-003689 you know ones that really add up after a while i guess you know from -[in]su[rance]- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
sw04340-B_005060-006206 oh well yeah that that that is a crime i guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like uh speeding's a crime [laughter] like i break that law every day [laughter]
sw04340-B_006525-006674 um-hum
sw04340-B_007745-007855 [noise]
sw04340-B_008021-008512 well i've uh i've been caught with marijuana before
sw04340-B_008512-008897 so i guess that was a crime i got a year's probation for that
sw04340-B_008897-009089 but uh
sw04340-B_009089-010223 no i it wasn't that big a deal uh when i when i think of crime i think of stuff that that aff[ects]- affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped i think rape is one of the worst crimes [laughter]
sw04340-B_010550-010808 yeah it's very degrading and
sw04340-B_011210-011359 yep
sw04340-B_011578-012330 yeah right once once a person's you know gone then it's [laughter] but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know
sw04340-B_013442-014019 well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders i think the death penalty is
sw04340-B_014019-014192 a pretty good thing
sw04340-B_014192-014536 they they have that down here in Florida still they have the electric chair
sw04340-B_014536-014740 and uh
sw04340-B_014740-015776 oh do they yeah i think i think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they're absolutely sure they got the right guy and i guess usually they're they're always sure they [laughter-got] the right guy but uh
sw04340-B_016031-016204 yeah so do i
sw04340-B_016851-017899 yeah i[f]- if that uh you know the sooner a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out i guess then you know there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they
sw04340-B_017899-018251 [laughter] it's like whoops [laughter] but
sw04340-B_018681-018823 um-hum
sw04340-B_019408-019548 right
sw04340-B_020471-021284 um yeah i don't know if it would or not though i d[on't]- i don't think it's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a
sw04340-B_021284-021953 a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members you know what i mean
sw04340-B_022134-022310 yeah
sw04340-B_022310-022622 yeah it kind of gets it off their chest
sw04340-B_022913-023498 [laughter] yeah i know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other
sw04340-B_023498-024373 and they are the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that i don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead but i g[uess]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you might be able to uh stop people
sw04340-B_024373-024713 you know they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught
sw04340-B_025190-025320 right
sw04340-B_025501-025650 yeah
sw04340-B_025650-025818 that's right
sw04340-B_027808-027938 yeah
sw04340-B_028225-028483 yeah they could p[robably]- probably do it again
sw04340-B_028736-029008 that's right they didn't have any time doing it the first time
sw04340-B_029656-029807 no it co[st]-
sw04341-A_000000-000700 okay_1 looks like we're ready to go capital punishment uh the problem i have with capital punishment is that uh
sw04341-A_000700-001538 uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that i don't think it deters anybody because [noise]
sw04341-A_001538-002766 most of the time crimes are uh are committed with[out]- without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldn't do this uh because uh
sw04341-A_002766-003450 i might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it
sw04341-A_003450-003724 and uh how about you
sw04341-A_004060-004376 uh-huh i do too yep
sw04341-A_004725-005124 uh-huh yeah you still have to do it i i
sw04341-A_005299-005749 um-hum so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then
sw04341-A_005852-006176 right um-hum
sw04341-A_006973-007141 um-hum
sw04341-A_007141-007547 needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society
sw04341-A_008052-008507 right and then do it all over again um-hum
sw04341-A_008843-009029 right
sw04341-A_009029-010177 have to agree with you and i'm kind of i[n]- in favor of capital punishment also i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but
sw04341-A_010177-011540 i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it [noise] i just i don't know that it's always effective [laughter] but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to
sw04341-A_011540-012124 determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
sw04341-A_012471-012698 um-hum
sw04341-A_013397-013750 um-hum right um-hum
sw04341-A_013998-015150 um-hum huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh [noise] like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that
sw04341-A_015519-015672 um-hum
sw04341-A_016397-016773 i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh
sw04341-A_017123-017276 um-hum
sw04341-A_017474-017621 um-hum
sw04341-A_017767-019250 um um-hum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in Biblical times [noise] when they had punishment
sw04341-A_019250-020285 if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family [noise] then you had the right
sw04341-A_020285-020927 to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person
sw04341-A_020927-022372 and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh [noise] but i i don't think that's done much anywhere [laughter] that's kind of drastic punishment
sw04341-A_022952-023125 right
sw04341-A_023230-023491 might make you feel better but [laughter]
sw04341-A_024074-024227 um-hum
sw04341-A_024570-024730 right
sw04341-A_025220-025366 um-hum
sw04341-A_025611-025748 right
sw04341-A_025973-026581 uh-huh right because they are a danger to everybody else huh that's interesting
sw04341-A_026581-027495 i have to uh agree with that there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh and uh
sw04341-A_027668-027848 [laughter] right
sw04341-A_027848-029296 [laughter-right] probably more of them then the other way around huh interesting i don't i don't not sure i i'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it i'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here
sw04341-A_029652-029799 um-hum
sw04341-B_003643-004249 well i think that in some cases it is warranted es[pecially]-
sw04341-B_004249-004849 and i don't i think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not
sw04341-B_004950-005600 i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or
sw04341-B_005712-006617 well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted because if a person
sw04341-B_006617-006800 who
sw04341-B_006800-007163 would do something like that in cold blood
sw04341-B_007524-007848 i mean you can't
sw04341-B_007848-008250 guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison
sw04341-B_008250-009002 and do it again and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective
sw04341-B_011893-012999 but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example um
sw04341-B_012999-014150 you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
sw04341-B_015101-015696 um it is to a certain extent but
sw04341-B_015696-016001 i think
sw04341-B_016001-016299 i don't know because
sw04341-B_016725-017985 i think in ce[rtain]- and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available
sw04341-B_022339-023138 well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment
sw04341-B_023138-023299 and
sw04341-B_023460-023808 but one thing i think that if
sw04341-B_023808-024200 there is a chance for rehabilitation
sw04341-B_024200-024738 then that chance sh[ould]- should be investigated
sw04341-B_024738-025337 but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically
sw04341-B_025337-026200 going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
sw04341-B_026598-026734 but
sw04341-B_027470-028000 and a lot of people that [laughter-are] a danger to society that aren't in prison
sw04341-B_029246-029978 well i know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment and i'm real[ly]- i'm from South Carolina
sw04342-A_000000-000738 [noise] so how do you uh so i[t]- so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so i can assume that you probably watch TV news is that
sw04342-A_000738-001007 really wow
sw04342-A_001007-001152 [vocalized-noise]
sw04342-A_001411-001646 uh what what station do you listen to
sw04342-A_002230-003406 cliff i see so um it's not affiliated with anything is it not not a network station okay_1 yeah because_1 i- i listen to uh public radio a lot and they have
sw04342-A_003406-004782 they have KCRW which i i- i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet i guess they're getting a little getting a little feisty now [laughter]
sw04342-A_005049-005265 uh
sw04342-A_005890-006270 yeah so you have a paper or something or
sw04342-A_006666-006836 um-hum
sw04342-A_006965-007086 yeah
sw04342-A_007172-007620 how do you like it it's been [vocalized-noise] it's been a while since i read the Dallas news i uh
sw04342-A_007620-008013 fact last time i read the Dallas Dallas news i was in Arkansas
sw04342-A_008013-008156 uh
sw04342-A_008320-008459 oh yeah
sw04342-A_008677-008815 [laughter]
sw04342-A_008815-009107 well that must be pretty bad [noise]
sw04342-A_009107-009251 so
sw04342-A_009251-009438 how did that happen anyway
sw04342-A_009619-009920 no not how i mean when did it when did they [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04342-A_010182-010335 oh really
sw04342-A_010409-010538 huh
sw04342-A_010703-011261 oh me i um [noise] good grief i read the Times Los Angeles Times there's uh
sw04342-A_011261-011690 quite a task if you've ever run into one they're uh spe[cially]-
sw04342-A_011690-012015 yeah they're thick um
sw04342-A_012015-012538 if there's something you want to know it's it's in the Times and then in in detail
sw04342-A_012538-012779 um
sw04342-A_012779-013542 they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the Herald Examiner collapsed about two years ago because of
sw04342-A_013542-014004 oh i don't know just just nobody was buying it really
sw04342-A_014177-015238 yeah pretty much um there used to be in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the San Fernando Valley
sw04342-A_015238-016346 and um they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because_1 i met the uh i met the i met the editor
sw04342-A_016346-017264 uh while i was on uh while i was doing jury service in Santa [laughter-Monica] [laughter-one] [laughter-time] it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy
sw04342-A_017264-017702 um you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff
sw04342-A_017702-018332 and uh it's it's a pretty good paper but um you know it's not the it's not the Times
sw04342-A_018332-018896 although i s[ee]- you know i'm starting to see some of their um there's there's a daily new
sw04342-A_018896-019553 uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess
sw04342-A_019553-020301 but uh a[nd]- and occasionally i- i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but
sw04342-A_020301-020594 you know it's i- i don't have time
sw04342-A_020909-021391 yeah that's that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people [laughter-who] [laughter-fall] [laughter-into] [laughter-that] [laughter-category]
sw04342-A_021634-021786 uh-huh
sw04342-A_022058-022215 i see
sw04342-A_022497-023558 yeah [noise] the big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf i have to admit the Times is kind of provincial too
sw04342-A_023558-024121 it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover
sw04342-A_024653-024784 uh-huh
sw04342-A_025505-025690 yeah i know
sw04342-A_025690-025826 i uh
sw04342-A_025826-026548 it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County [laughter]
sw04342-A_026548-027624 [laughter] i mean [laughter] the way they i mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed shots to go south of the LA county border [laughter]
sw04342-A_028594-028736 yeah
sw04342-A_028736-028876 oh really
sw04342-A_028980-029984 yeah yeah i- i- i find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover things that are interesting to us
sw04342-B_000000-000029 [noise]
sw04342-B_000595-001473 i almost never watch TV news [laughter] i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio
sw04342-B_001603-002033 uh it's a local radio station it's called uh
sw04342-B_002033-002249 KLIF cliff
sw04342-B_002699-003009 no no
sw04342-B_004739-005110 well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news
sw04342-B_005110-005897 [noise] and occasionally in the morning i'll pick up something like uh CNN or that but i hate watching the like ten o'clock news or
sw04342-B_006199-006978 yeah we have a lo[cal]- well we have uh Dallas Morning News which is the big paper in Dallas we read it i read it pretty much
sw04342-B_006978-007141 from cover to cover
sw04342-B_008034-008391 [noise] the Times Herald went out of business here
sw04342-B_008391-008846 and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper
sw04342-B_009439-009638 uh financial trouble
sw04342-B_009779-009937 oh when did it happen
sw04342-B_009937-010251 i guess they closed down about three months ago
sw04342-B_010251-010348 [noise]
sw04342-B_010574-010750 so how do you keep up
sw04342-B_011473-011779 yes they're very voluminous
sw04342-B_011779-012062 [laughter]
sw04342-B_013870-014196 so there really is only one major LA newspaper now
sw04342-B_014442-014644 [noise]
sw04342-B_018255-018442 yeah
sw04342-B_020514-021037 i used to read Time magazine a lot but i don't read it much anymore [noise]
sw04342-B_021237-022142 [laughter] and then we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community
sw04342-B_022142-022499 because_1 we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the Dallas Morning News
sw04342-B_024060-024717 now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section
sw04342-B_024717-025205 and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano
sw04342-B_025205-025516 but it's still not an awful lot of news
sw04342-B_026450-026792 [laughter]
sw04342-B_027603-028355 oh i would imagine in uh you know [noise] in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub[urbs]- suburbs and
sw04342-B_028355-029037 of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
sw04342-B_029849-029984 yeah
sw04343-A_000000-001377 [noise] i guess i'll give my opinions here first okay uh in terms of taxes here i guess uh i feel like we are paying an awful lot of them_1 uh and getting apparently very little for it
sw04343-A_001377-002439 uh especially since uh the things that i think that our taxes are going for are i- i guess in my opinion not the uh a[ppropriate]- necessarily appropriate things
sw04343-A_002439-003721 i think that uh uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never
sw04343-A_003721-004174 do anything but continue to be uh uh
sw04343-A_004174-004368 sponges for money
sw04343-A_004368-004900 i mean we need to do uh programs which are more on the concept of
sw04343-A_004900-005073 uh
sw04343-A_005073-005573 well like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the housing
sw04343-A_005573-006504 but uh then turning the housing over that now see i- i agreed with that one and i'm not very often into those kind of those kind of programs but that one made sense
sw04343-A_006504-007722 help these people to fix their houses to improve their their environment i mean uh uh p[rojects]- projects were the most idiotic concept in the world

sw04343-A_024330-025156 uh we[ll]- part part of the symp[tom]- symptom of a democratic s[ystem]- system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up

sw04344-B_027744-027971 yeah i-
sw04344-B_027971-028671 where i went to school though a l[ot]- at college a lot of them_1 i mean i mean i've never been one to feel
sw04344-B_028671-029776 pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but i couldn't believe how some of the college people dress because_1 you know i always think of low inc[ome]- i at least i was low income going to school you know and it was like
sw04345-A_000000-000053 [noise]
sw04345-A_003234-003873 no we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area i can hear it at the um
sw04345-A_003873-004695 uh oh the college town nearby when i'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away but the FM signal doesn't reach this far
sw04345-A_004695-005847 uh i listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin
sw04345-A_005847-006158 uh i agree with you too on the um
sw04345-A_006158-006591 uh the cable channel CNN and Headline News
sw04345-A_006591-007542 um i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why i rely on shortwave and and then the cable CNN
sw04345-A_009663-010668 i think a lot of it is just um the fact that in the US you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or
sw04345-A_010668-011115 or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a
sw04345-A_011115-012113 it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on the shortwave it's BBC is um
sw04345-A_012113-012564 oh i don't know the right word is is almost um
sw04345-A_012564-012969 they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
sw04345-A_012969-013393 and it just they seem to give more just the facts than opinions
sw04345-A_014354-014821 uh very much so very much so and i- i think a lot of it is um
sw04345-A_014821-015060 especially TV news
sw04345-A_015060-015769 they don't really have the time and a lot of them_1 don't have the education and the background to um
sw04345-A_015769-016910 oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it i mean i you know i think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting
sw04345-A_018333-019243 oh i like the straight reporting um and then i- i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
sw04345-A_019243-020403 um i always think it's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
sw04345-A_020403-020799 and a lot of times i don't hear [laughter-exactly] what they what they write into it
sw04345-A_020914-021350 so i overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting
sw04345-A_028359-029634 yeah i- i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or at a read a magazine or USA Today and read in four paragraphs
sw04345-A_029634-029869 uh and and find out every
sw04345-B_000000-000063 [noise]

sw04345-B_007572-008549 i'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world
sw04345-B_008549-009109 uh compares with the American coverage of
sw04345-B_009109-009384 how do you think that uh
sw04345-B_009384-009622 the viewpoints differ
sw04345-B_010867-011019 um-hum
sw04345-B_012810-012950 um-hum
sw04345-B_013583-014405 do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts

sw04345-B_017161-017367 which uh
sw04345-B_017492-018319 which approach do you find to be um more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting

sw04345-B_020725-020872 um-hum
sw04345-B_021447-022070 one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict
sw04345-B_022070-022735 was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was
sw04345-B_022735-023394 presenting uh some of the things that were available uh there was a
sw04345-B_023394-023804 there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out
sw04345-B_023804-025077 building where there was obviously a crudely uh a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was
sw04345-B_025077-026387 being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him
sw04345-B_026387-027616 for reporting the fact that thi[s]- you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh and i think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having
sw04345-B_027616-028359 the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them

sw04346-A_018062-019376 all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north Tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
sw04346-A_019376-019579 you know um
sw04346-A_019579-020348 that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't um
sw04346-A_020348-020960 you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning
sw04346-A_020960-021488 you know they really don't have much of a chance at all and
sw04346-A_021488-021641 huh
sw04346-A_021641-022577 [noise] oh [noise] why are [laughter-you] [laughter] you j[ust]- they just don't i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kid's school

sw04346-A_023723-024363 and i- i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated
sw04346-A_024363-025709 they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and um bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this
sw04346-A_025709-027047 um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and um they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing
sw04346-A_027047-027218 you know
sw04346-A_027826-027959 uh-huh
sw04346-A_028332-028475 um-hum
sw04346-A_028661-028802 yeah
sw04346-B_000000-000082 [noise]
sw04346-B_000082-000256 okay you go first
sw04346-B_000681-000804 um-hum
sw04346-B_001376-001498 um-hum
sw04346-B_003213-003473 [laughter]
sw04346-B_005386-005539 um-hum
sw04346-B_005539-005691 um-hum
sw04346-B_006399-007289 well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was [vocalized-noise] going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
sw04346-B_007289-007887 um i grew up in New York and um the place or not New York City upstate New York
sw04346-B_007887-008718 and i went to uh the City of Rochester School District and s[o]- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
sw04346-B_008718-009312 and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but
sw04346-B_009312-010383 the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system
sw04346-B_010383-011359 and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs
sw04346-B_011359-012004 and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
sw04346-B_012004-013357 as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had
sw04346-B_013357-014465 [noise] and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of
sw04346-B_014465-015789 of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools
sw04346-B_015789-016655 or they'll move farther away [laughter] to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of
sw04346-B_018515-018665 yeah
sw04346-B_019325-019470 um-hum
sw04346-B_020894-021020 um-hum
sw04346-B_021240-021370 yeah
sw04346-B_021370-021538 why is that
sw04346-B_021538-021685 why is that
sw04346-B_021910-022051 [laughter]
sw04346-B_024147-024299 right
sw04346-B_024299-024441 right
sw04346-B_025640-025794 right
sw04346-B_026623-026747 um-hum
sw04346-B_027086-028024 yeah yeah [noise] yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education
sw04346-B_028024-029102 i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were
sw04346-B_029102-029731 you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know
sw04347-A_000000-000103 [noise]
sw04347-A_000223-001218 uh not too bad really um i had a razor that i got for Christmas that i just i really didn't want it but i got it anyway and uh
sw04347-A_001218-002016 it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so uh i was able to get that back pretty easily
sw04347-A_002016-002486 but uh i don't know i really haven't returned a whole lot lately have you
sw04347-A_003574-004110 um [laughter] right [laughter]
sw04347-A_004508-004633 yeah
sw04347-A_004897-005073 right like
sw04347-A_005303-005576 exactly i was reading
sw04347-A_005870-007346 right i was reading something in uh Consumer Reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever
sw04347-A_007346-008310 um like i've got an eighty six Ford Ranger and and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi you know so it's like what are you going to do you know
sw04347-A_008310-008799 but uh that's the way it is i don't know i i personally feel that uh
sw04347-A_008799-010196 uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them_1 you know that's the way it goes and you know people man[ufacturers]- American manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products and
sw04347-A_010718-011662 that's what i thought too until i saw the Consumer Reports issue uh they've got all the American well all the c[ars]- all the cars rated you know and uh
sw04347-A_011662-012781 essentially i h[aven't]- i don't see much of a trend i mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them
sw04347-A_012781-013655 uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars but then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and they're pieces of junk you know
sw04347-A_013655-014531 yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one but uh i don't know may[be]- maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue uh
sw04347-A_014872-015861 yeah that's just it technology that that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple[mented]- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh
sw04347-A_016111-016663 oh yeah because_1 technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time uh
sw04347-A_017369-017534 yeah
sw04347-A_018133-018825 [laughter] yeah it uh th[ey]- they keep up goo[d]- with it pretty quickly and that's that's a real good thing i guess
sw04347-A_018825-019054 um i don't know
sw04347-A_019631-019755 yeah
sw04347-A_019910-020865 right they're kind of the leaders right now you know i used to see all those commercials for Windows you know and you're like oh gee they're reselling a Macintosh under a different name
sw04347-A_021084-021303 yeah you know almost
sw04347-A_021303-022277 exactly almost is the key word there too you know because_1 i- i really i've used both and i really don't see an advantage of Windows at all uh
sw04347-A_022490-022739 yeah yeah that's just it
sw04347-A_022739-023702 but uh i don't know i'm really i've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because_1 i don't have one at home i- i do use a Mac at work but uh
sw04347-A_023702-024197 uh i really don't don't do much with it at home but uh
sw04347-A_025514-026097 right uh-huh yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business
sw04347-A_026724-026920 yeah all right
sw04347-A_027179-027311 no
sw04347-A_027311-027542 well that's that's all right
sw04347-A_027748-027959 yeah that's true
sw04347-A_027959-028537 something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
sw04347-A_028537-029519 and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example of a modem for you know
sw04347-A_029519-030077 okay w[hat]- w[hat]- what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud
sw04347-B_000000-000350 [noise] okay so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning gi[fts]- products
sw04347-B_001968-002103 um-hum
sw04347-B_002478-003917 i haven't had to it's uh the every so often i mean i- i- i'm almost pushing it myself maybe i'll buy a shirt from GI Joe's and it shrinks too much and say well i should have known better i mean i bought it from GI Joe's and it was probably made in China by slaves
sw04347-B_003917-005329 but uh [laughter] they uh most of the time [vocalized-noise] pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy [laughter-American] it takes real extra work to find
sw04347-B_005329-005940 and it's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the US [laughter]
sw04347-B_006634-006765 uh-huh
sw04347-B_007290-007421 yeah
sw04347-B_008000-008163 huh
sw04347-B_008163-008359 yeah really
sw04347-B_010027-010855 yeah i think they're beginning to the the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away and
sw04347-B_011073-011201 uh-huh
sw04347-B_013474-013765 oh know still at it hey
sw04347-B_013954-014089 wow
sw04347-B_014414-014969 well they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up -[un]til ninety four or [laughter-so]
sw04347-B_015207-015338 hm
sw04347-B_015711-016194 the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
sw04347-B_016536-017474 and can you think of any other industry where in software they uh if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail it's like here
sw04347-B_017474-018247 or uh maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
sw04347-B_018247-018433 [laughter]
sw04347-B_018778-018911 yeah
sw04347-B_018911-020000 and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the Macintosh is about the only one that's going it's right forcing IBM and the rest of the DOS world to follow along
sw04347-B_020411-020559 [laughter]
sw04347-B_020775-021411 really why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price they [laughter-could] [laughter-sell] more if they were honest
sw04347-B_022111-022560 yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure DOS
sw04347-B_022560-022765 i mean that's their client base
sw04347-B_023554-023686 um-hum
sw04347-B_024066-024504 Apple's sort of making a [vocalized-noise] and they're ones were growling consumer
sw04347-B_024504-025682 uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them_1 had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive
sw04347-B_026016-026825 yeah i have one i do desktop publishing at work and i have a machine at home and i belong to the user's group and i i've been a Mac fanatic since they came out
sw04347-B_026825-027365 but uh technically i'm not actually in the industry i don't work for a computer company i'm an abuser [laughter]
sw04347-B_027467-028020 but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen
sw04347-B_029465-029590 yeah
sw04348-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04348-A_000027-000515 so it's kind of an obsolete [laughter-question] at this point since there isn't a Soviet Union anymore but
sw04348-A_000812-001677 for former right right w[e]- we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead is that
sw04348-A_001677-001813 and
sw04348-A_002325-003203 i- i don't consider them_1 so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that we're already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country
sw04348-A_003203-003917 you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more [laughter-about] than the Soviet Union
sw04348-A_004099-004901 you know i mean we already had the case where they had those uh guys selling ura[nium]- trying to sell uranium on the open market
sw04348-A_005681-006847 yeah and and in fact i i've been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so they don't go to Libya or somewhere like that
sw04348-A_007527-008719 right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fair[ly]- is fairly high
sw04348-A_008719-009179 but you know there's certainly a lot of people arguing there right now [laughter-who] [laughter-all] have nuclear weapons
sw04348-A_009179-009861 and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign uh republics who are a lot of them Islamic
sw04348-A_009861-011144 some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they break off and [vocalized-noise] for instance decide to align with Iran or Iraq then suddenly we're in a very difficult position
sw04348-A_011828-011970 um
sw04348-A_012247-012379 yeah
sw04348-A_013517-013997 right and and the of course the other thing is you've got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and
sw04348-A_013997-015328 all of that so there's the whole question whether one of the [vocalized-noise] uh sub drivers is gonna decide to become free lance oh i don't wanna i don't wanna go with Russia so i'm going to uh you know sell myself to the highest bidder or something
sw04348-A_015810-015966 right
sw04348-A_016595-017223 right you know the o[ther]- the other possible scenario of course is that in in i[t's]- it's gonna be hard for the entire
sw04348-A_017223-018271 area to have them_1 but for instance you can see in Russia especially now there's a lot of hard liners coming back because_1 th[e]- the economic reforms aren't working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again
sw04348-A_018271-019630 the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons
sw04348-A_020285-020413 yeah
sw04348-A_020778-021794 yeah but i i have to say i think all o[verall]- overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually sta[ble]- more stable than they were before because
sw04348-A_021794-022965 i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the United States
sw04348-A_023165-024398 yeah i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh not looking to us for you know uh invasion at this point
sw04348-A_026095-026826 um-hum so you know i- i think it it's more gonna be i don't think we're looking at [vocalized-noise] uh potential for anything large scale
sw04348-A_026826-027851 um you know i think there's certainly some people in in the US government who would like us to think that they're still a threat um you know i was listening to MPR yesterday talk about the Sea Hawk submarine
sw04348-A_027851-028934 and you know i'm saying you know wait a minute here why do we wanna build like two or three multibillion dollar submarines you know and the reason is to keep Gratin Connecticut at all alive but
sw04348-A_028934-029856 yeah i- i think that there's there are people in government who perc[eive]- who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore
sw04348-B_000000-000058 [noise]
sw04348-B_000448-000878 right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that former Soviet Union
sw04348-B_001522-002399 that that's true too on that one well i- i- i personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us
sw04348-B_003824-004251 tha[t]- that that's very true i- i would agree with that also or
sw04348-B_004795-005898 that that part is very true there's also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by
sw04348-B_006759-007630 sure so i mean yeah so i i- i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union that's threatening us though
sw04348-B_008115-008280 [noise]
sw04348-B_011068-011949 sure a[nother]- another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area
sw04348-B_011949-012308 since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different Commonwealths
sw04348-B_012308-013057 uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not [laughter-type]
sw04348-B_013057-013592 systems i mean what what's the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor
sw04348-B_014605-014724 right
sw04348-B_015252-015827 absolutely so yeah that that that whole thing is a very scary thing [destabulation/destabilization] de[stabilization]- destabilization
sw04348-B_015827-016410 and let it let it choke on that one uh the [laughter-uh] you know the Soviet Union has been a uh
sw04348-B_016410-016674 a big concern it's a scary thing
sw04348-B_018249-018389 sure
sw04348-B_019496-020344 tha[t]- tha[t]- that's very true um you know granted that you know The Cold War was a very scary thing but at least it was a non commodity
sw04348-B_020344-020883 you know we we knew what we we're you know we knew what we were up against
sw04348-B_022885-023246 well especially_1 now that they're divided they're not bigger than we are anymore
sw04348-B_024195-025217 yeah i- i think it is very true uh you know we're once again even the even the ones that aren't necessarily looking for help from us you know they getting massive amounts of help or or wanting that from Germany and
sw04348-B_025217-026202 from other from other third world countries so that would that would probably also keep you know blatant uh uh you know acts of war out of the uh picture
sw04348-B_029747-029856 sure
sw04349-A_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04349-A_000050-000682 the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four Nissan truck
sw04349-A_000682-001241 i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it
sw04349-A_001241-001752 and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
sw04349-A_001752-002075 and it has eight spark plugs
sw04349-A_002075-002613 and it's hard to to get get at them_1 and plus
sw04349-A_002613-003039 the time [vocalized-noise] i just don't have time anymore um
sw04349-A_003152-003508 as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself
sw04349-A_003698-004629 i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i- i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once
sw04349-A_004629-004799 but
sw04349-A_004799-005230 the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes [noise] i wanted
sw04349-A_005230-006667 i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs t[o]- should be changed re[gularly]- very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubri[cation]- lubrication system needs to kee[p]- be lubricated and
sw04349-A_006886-007757 so i- i stay on top of that [noise] but i- [noise] i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed
sw04349-A_007757-008622 and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
sw04349-A_008622-009432 just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they ch[anged]- i had them_1 another thing i- i let them_1 do sometimes is that
sw04349-A_009432-010504 i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
sw04349-A_010504-011165 and they told me that my my brake pads were [laughter-gosh] you know [laughter-seventy] percent still good you know
sw04349-A_011165-012122 but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus
sw04349-A_012122-012447 and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but
sw04349-A_012447-012940 i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a me[chanic]-
sw04349-A_012940-013745 a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i- i still have a pretty good feel for it
sw04349-A_013745-014125 but one thing i didn't know is that
sw04349-A_014248-014730 when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i ha[d]- i had bigger cars
sw04349-A_014730-015462 and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little Nissan
sw04349-A_015462-015965 i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten
sw04349-A_015965-016287 so i drove on those brake pads
sw04349-A_016287-017475 for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them_1 so those small little trucks and cars like that th[ey]- they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
sw04349-A_017656-017782 ex[actly]-
sw04349-A_017868-018569 exactly so i you know but i- i just did it anyway i like to st[ay]- i like to stay up on it you know like to st[ay]- kind of stay up on it then
sw04349-A_018569-019150 if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time
sw04349-A_019150-019350 and pull my dip stick
sw04349-A_019350-020359 and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i- i- i keep it that way because that's
sw04349-A_020359-020733 that is the key to the longevity so
sw04349-A_020733-020892 s[o]- so how
sw04349-A_021426-021572 uh-huh
sw04349-A_021800-021962 uh oh [laughter]
sw04349-A_021962-022007 [laughter]
sw04349-A_022389-022533 uh-huh
sw04349-A_022877-023023 um-hum
sw04349-A_023145-023278 okay
sw04349-A_024303-024460 um-hum
sw04349-A_025102-025429 you're talking about_1 the vibration dampener
sw04349-A_025758-026019 that's the vibration dampener yeah
sw04349-A_026169-026326 okay
sw04349-A_026865-027031 hm
sw04349-A_027378-027543 uh oh
sw04349-A_027858-027991 hm
sw04349-A_028107-028273 uh oh
sw04349-A_028273-028420 hm
sw04349-A_028920-029101 [laughter]
sw04349-A_029633-029785 um-hum
sw04349-B_000000-000063 [noise]
sw04349-B_000063-008551 [noise]
sw04349-B_008551-008853 just to pack the bearings
sw04349-B_010441-010599 right
sw04349-B_011949-012251 right and they repacked the wheel bearings
sw04349-B_017395-017981 you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface material on the pads is so good
sw04349-B_020540-020730 right
sw04349-B_020730-020892 well
sw04349-B_020892-021172 it it sounds like you've had um
sw04349-B_021172-021511 some good experiences with that uh
sw04349-B_021511-021875 and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
sw04349-B_021875-022134 um i
sw04349-B_022134-022556 i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh
sw04349-B_022556-023193 and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit
sw04349-B_023193-024106 and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can
sw04349-B_024106-024789 use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were
sw04349-B_024789-025222 um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum
sw04349-B_025385-025985 well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley
sw04349-B_025985-026284 and uh the water pump pulley
sw04349-B_026284-026456 so
sw04349-B_026456-026957 when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things
sw04349-B_026957-027111 and uh
sw04349-B_027111-027475 probably about_1 four months ago the water pump decided to go out
sw04349-B_027475-028156 so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
sw04349-B_028156-028366 but not far enough to notice
sw04349-B_028366-029001 so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
sw04349-B_029001-029103 [laughter]
sw04349-B_029103-029907 so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i
sw04350-A_000000-000867 [noise] well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um
sw04350-A_000867-002195 health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um [noise] facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day
sw04350-A_003025-003283 um yeah same here
sw04350-A_003897-004073 um
sw04350-A_004218-004358 yeah
sw04350-A_004486-004652 yeah
sw04350-A_005773-006261 another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours
sw04350-A_006384-006597 [noise] yeah [noise]
sw04350-A_006597-007099 [noise] well right now i'm still in school i'm still a student but the ability to
sw04350-A_007099-008213 you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that
sw04350-A_008213-008766 feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that
sw04350-A_008766-008966 and
sw04350-A_009188-009349 [noise] yeah
sw04350-A_009570-009719 [noise]
sw04350-A_009887-010241 [vocalized-noise]
sw04350-A_010502-010727 yeah that can be rough
sw04350-A_010727-011107 yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that
sw04350-A_011107-011477 [noise] swore to never do it again
sw04350-A_011477-012332 i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of
sw04350-A_012332-012986 um [noise] like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place
sw04350-A_012986-013663 um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more
sw04350-A_013663-013925 they get um allowances for
sw04350-A_013925-014823 um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case
sw04350-A_014823-015202 but um they get housing and stuff like that [noise]
sw04350-A_015465-016074 and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that
sw04350-A_016074-017091 but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how
sw04350-A_017091-018274 you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing
sw04350-A_018274-018562 some kind of consideration there would be nice as well
sw04350-A_018562-018889 i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh
sw04350-A_018889-019238 not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place
sw04350-A_019238-019574 if they're just gonna pork you in the end
sw04350-A_020549-020717 yeah
sw04350-A_020717-020901 yeah
sw04350-A_021805-022124 yeah it's a good consideration for families
sw04350-A_022124-022506 that's absolute necessity in today's world and price
sw04350-A_022506-022785 man they're getting so expensive
sw04350-A_022785-023217 right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you
sw04350-A_023217-023667 no i'm gonna be thirty this year but [laughter]
sw04350-A_023667-023948 and yeah i'm working on my PhD
sw04350-A_023948-025051 it's a long road [noise] but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if
sw04350-A_025051-026075 if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then
sw04350-A_026075-026320 Georgia Tech in Atlanta
sw04350-A_026320-027407 [noise] but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that
sw04350-A_027407-028602 and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasn't prepared to pay for it i'm not too sure what i'm gonna do about that right now there's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant feeling worrying about that
sw04350-A_029298-029475 hm
sw04350-A_029638-029856 is there any deductible with that or anything like
sw04350-B_000000-000084 [noise]
sw04350-B_002039-003163 i- i definitely agree on that um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever
sw04350-B_003163-003354 um [laughter]
sw04350-B_003354-003970 but as far as what i'd really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could
sw04350-B_003970-004743 if there was some sort of pro[vided]- provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to chan[ge]- to take a shower before work
sw04350-B_004743-004953 and some place to lock the bicycles up
sw04350-B_004953-005226 and i've heard of a lot of other companies providing that
sw04350-B_005226-005404 that would be something to look forward to
sw04350-B_005404-005566 um
sw04350-B_005566-005675 [noise]
sw04350-B_005675-005864 let's see
sw04350-B_006154-006492 [laughter] well a lot depends on the job though [laughter]
sw04350-B_006492-006661 what do you do
sw04350-B_006779-006936 oh okay
sw04350-B_008147-008301 right
sw04350-B_008646-008848 yeah that would be nice
sw04350-B_008848-009263 i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment you're in
sw04350-B_009263-009609 um [noise] i'm right now also a full time student
sw04350-B_009609-009955 and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm
sw04350-B_009955-010226 so it's a ra[ther]- yeah it's a rather interesting uh
sw04350-B_010226-010820 [noise] rather in[teresting]- interesting set up [noise] work full time go to school full time
sw04350-B_010995-011209 [laughter]
sw04350-B_011209-011375 but
sw04350-B_012890-013054 how so
sw04350-B_014768-015018 well they do
sw04350-B_015018-015187 yeah
sw04350-B_015187-015557 yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks
sw04350-B_015918-016148 [noise] right right
sw04350-B_019180-019323 right
sw04350-B_019504-020491 um what a lot what a lot of companies do is fa[r]- as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family
sw04350-B_020491-020832 in a lot of cases i know that's the case in my office at least
sw04350-B_020832-021658 they'll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and depend[ent]- codependent children not like the case applies to me but um
sw04350-B_021658-021886 it is nice that they offer it
sw04350-B_022266-022602 definitely and health insurance costs
sw04350-B_023040-023289 you you're not still covered under your parents
sw04350-B_023394-023818 oh wow [laughter] when you said you were going to school full time [laughter]
sw04350-B_023818-024109 oh that's different [noise]
sw04350-B_024810-024941 um-hum
sw04350-B_025161-025281 [noise]
sw04350-B_025281-025463 [laughter]
sw04350-B_025565-025694 [noise] right
sw04350-B_025987-026205 what school is this
sw04350-B_026205-026366 [noise] oh wow
sw04350-B_027342-027488 wow
sw04350-B_028382-028545 right now
sw04350-B_028545-029160 right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think it's thirty dollars a month
sw04350-B_029160-029350 so that'll be at three sixty a year
sw04350-B_029350-029621 and that's basic uh group health coverage
sw04350-B_029758-029856 no
sw04351-A_000000-000147 [noise] home [laughter] because_1 i'm
sw04351-A_000147-000308 leaving from work
sw04351-A_000308-001110 okay well uh i don't know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the Army
sw04351-A_001110-002323 active duty twenty years and of course when you're active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness
sw04351-A_002323-003252 but you're required to take a what we call a P T test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year
sw04351-A_003252-004213 so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group
sw04351-A_004213-005211 and if you didn't pass the test [noise] then they put you on what they called remedial P T and every morning you have to go to the company and
sw04351-A_005211-006009 jog in formation [laughter] in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment
sw04351-A_006009-006135 [laughter]
sw04351-A_006375-007125 what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running
sw04351-A_007125-007884 and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so
sw04351-A_007884-008632 now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in Virginia and i live in Maryland
sw04351-A_008632-009219 and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here
sw04351-A_009219-010009 which is about fifty miles work all day [laughter] fifty miles back on the Capitol Beltway and of course it's dark by the time i get home and
sw04351-A_010009-010568 so i have to admit [laughter] that i i have fallen off uh slightly
sw04351-A_010568-010916 or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely
sw04351-A_010916-011506 and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday
sw04351-A_011506-012056 so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have
sw04351-A_012056-013131 yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet
sw04351-A_013131-013342 and uh how about yourself
sw04351-A_013613-013801 um uh-huh
sw04351-A_014074-014215 uh-huh
sw04351-A_014412-014752 um so you have a good sustained work out
sw04351-A_014752-014918 yeah
sw04351-A_014918-015545 oh yeah yeah that's that is a long time to have [laughter] at it but that's of course uh
sw04351-A_015545-016195 uh there's a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i don't know does that cause you any injuries or anything
sw04351-A_016299-016429 no
sw04351-A_016921-017071 uh-huh
sw04351-A_017071-017400 [laughter-right] either an elbow in the eye
sw04351-A_017549-017693 right
sw04351-A_017849-018532 uh-huh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive
sw04351-A_018532-019398 uh i didn't have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me
sw04351-A_019398-019949 and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit
sw04351-A_019949-020824 but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the Army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at
sw04351-A_020824-021556 Fort Ben Harrison Indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise
sw04351-A_021556-021731 that sort of thing and
sw04351-A_021731-022128 so at least from that i [noise] i realize the importance of it
sw04351-A_022128-022231 and uh
sw04351-A_022747-022917 uh
sw04351-A_022917-024032 not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit
sw04351-A_024032-025260 and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while [noise] but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape
sw04351-A_025260-026112 and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement
sw04351-A_026112-026889 through just simple things like you're going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh [noise]
sw04351-A_026889-027605 uh matter of fact i've very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to
sw04351-A_027605-028130 but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to
sw04351-A_028130-029123 but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in h[er]- in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good
sw04351-A_029123-029962 yeah and uh so she's slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program
sw04351-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04351-B_000049-000245 [laughter]
sw04351-B_000245-000367 yeah

sw04351-B_006044-006184 [laughter]
sw04351-B_006184-006679 well so now that you're out of that what what sort of regime do you keep up with

sw04351-B_013043-013171 uh-huh
sw04351-B_013338-013745 well i i generally play tennis two or three times a week
sw04351-B_013745-014505 and that's that's by enlarge about the only form of exercise i get but when i go out and play i generally play for two or three hours at a time
sw04351-B_014505-014660 so
sw04351-B_014660-015152 yeah so that that's that's quite strenuous for that long of a period
sw04351-B_016096-017280 [noise] um not not generally i i uh [noise] the few times i try and play basketball it seems like i always always sprain an ankle or twist a finger or something [laughter]
sw04351-B_017280-017950 uh but tennis is not quite as extreme and i don't seem to have any uh injuries like that
sw04351-B_019324-019449 right
sw04351-B_019875-020003 right
sw04351-B_021501-021636 uh-huh
sw04351-B_022069-022223 right
sw04351-B_022223-022815 have you noticed any changes since you've started reducing the fat content of your diet
sw04351-B_023571-023697 uh-huh
sw04351-B_023803-023937 right
sw04351-B_026051-026158 huh
sw04351-B_026513-026641 yeah
sw04351-B_027540-027663 yeah
sw04351-B_028030-028162 right
sw04351-B_029016-029209 yeah that's encouraging
sw04352-A_000000-001405 [noise] i'm i'm a student at in college right now so i'm not really in the market for a car i have one though i bought this past summer a used car which i you know hope it will last me for a while um but uh i guess
sw04352-A_001405-001913 it it fits my needs pretty well it's a um a Ford uh Tempo
sw04352-A_001913-003136 and uh it's sort of you know nice car not not really you know huge and and a tank but uh big enough so that you can fit people in the backseat so you know it's nice when i go places with other people
sw04352-A_003136-003644 uh and uh and there's sort of an ordinary car it seems fairly reliable
sw04352-A_003644-003756 how about_1 you
sw04352-A_004530-004621 oh
sw04352-A_006049-006172 [laughter]
sw04352-A_006602-007183 yeah they're they're pretty nice they're kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah
sw04352-A_007183-007547 [noise] if i- i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might
sw04352-A_007547-007882 [noise] possibly buy something like that um
sw04352-A_007882-008775 but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said [noise] the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a Ford Explorer
sw04352-A_008775-009679 [noise] and they're kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um
sw04352-A_009679-010782 you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move [laughter-about] twice a year at this point um that kind of th[ing]- thing would be very handy um
sw04352-A_010782-011707 but uh yeah i don't again i don't really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my car uh you know the major criteria was that it uh
sw04352-A_011707-012216 you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um
sw04352-A_012216-012724 and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh
sw04352-A_012724-014054 and i- i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and i'm i'm very [laughter] happy with it it's not it's not you know i suppose if i'd the maximum reliability i would've gotten from a Japanese car but um they also sell for much more especially used
sw04352-A_014054-014830 and i sort of decided that it probably wasn't worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs
sw04352-A_014830-015536 but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i don't know if that's true uh you know it probably isn't worth it more hm
sw04352-A_015678-016612 no i didn't that's a Ford yeah i didn't i mean i- i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh
sw04352-A_016612-017398 that's [laughter-factored] into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay i mean if you're going for like um
sw04352-A_017398-018241 you know say a a you know five year old car um gi[ven]- with for given amount of mileage the Japanese car'll be
sw04352-A_018241-019148 going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh
sw04352-A_019148-020378 Japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something
sw04352-A_020378-020812 and you know people would say well you know i mean they last forever and whatever but i
sw04352-A_020812-021282 i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm
sw04352-A_021282-021436 yeah i mean any
sw04352-A_021541-022897 yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i- i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasn't gonna buy something with you know eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh
sw04352-A_023059-023243 really i'm surprised
sw04352-A_023524-023782 oh okay well that's [laughter-see] [laughter-yeah] that's
sw04352-A_023782-023964 [noise]
sw04352-A_023964-024609 yeah i've heard is it the Hondas where you have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something like that
sw04352-A_024609-024761 it's one of the
sw04352-A_025287-025795 did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive
sw04352-A_026302-026415 hm
sw04352-A_026531-026632 okay
sw04352-A_026906-027405 yeah i think yeah i kin[d]- i think i remember it hearing that either the Hondas or the Toyotas um
sw04352-A_027405-027662 that if the timing belt went
sw04352-A_027662-028870 in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage
sw04352-A_028870-029229 i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing
sw04352-A_029229-029885 um yeah but i- i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's

sw04352-B_005004-005096 [laughter] and i
sw04352-B_005096-006199 and i my friends kept telling me that i could afford a better car but they said but i was happy with my Impala so i drove that for about three years till it completely died and then i got the Prelude
sw04352-B_006199-006670 and i think if i were to buy another car right now i think i'd buy another Prelude i really like it
sw04352-B_006670-006846 [noise]

sw04352-B_017064-017229 oh i see
sw04352-B_018449-018841 you're gonna pay a lot more for it yeah that's what i found
sw04352-B_021026-021695 they don't last forever they they don't last forever they maybe last twenty percent longer or something but still
sw04352-B_022736-023107 yeah and as happy as i am with my Honda i have had problems with it
sw04352-B_023107-023914 yeah i mean i haven't had serious problems with it but it's got a hundred thousand miles on it now so i you know i replaced the clutch and timing chain
sw04352-B_024564-025389 i don't know i've heard that with Honda with Honda's it's pretty natural it's pretty normal to need a new timing belt after i think think seventy seventy thousand miles
sw04352-B_025733-026284 no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while we're in there and i said nah
sw04352-B_026284-026361 [laughter]
sw04352-B_026361-026943 now i wish and i wished i had later because i had to go in and uh i couldn't i couldn't move the car i had to go and replace it

sw04353-B_003539-004006 um it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal
sw04353-B_004006-004481 so i have to be that's that's kind of the way i feel about it you know
sw04353-B_005348-005506 yes
sw04353-B_005506-005819 do you have a two income family or one income

sw04353-B_008373-008518 yes
sw04353-B_008518-009068 is that what her is is her career uh related to to finance or accounting
sw04353-B_009535-009674 oh
sw04353-B_009775-009915 uh-huh
sw04353-B_010089-010429 yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit
sw04353-B_010429-010551 yeah
sw04353-B_012336-012512 yeah
sw04353-B_012512-013070 it's just taking it out right right yeah yeah we do the same thing
sw04353-B_013330-014374 yeah if if you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they'll match it
sw04353-B_014374-015314 um that you know we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess
sw04353-B_015314-015935 but he was with another company before that but we have we have i- i work also but i only have a part time job
sw04353-B_015935-016667 and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food mo[ney]- Jim gives me a certain amount money
sw04353-B_016667-017525 you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle
sw04353-B_017525-018166 you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house
sw04353-B_018166-018296 so
sw04353-B_018458-018602 yeah
sw04353-B_018834-019419 yeah we well Jim has Jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down
sw04353-B_019419-020135 um you know i'm given so much mon[ey]- money a month so i am supposed to kind of get the food out of that so i try not to you know we don't
sw04353-B_020135-021155 you know i don't ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
sw04353-B_021155-021782 and uh you can b[uy]- you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married
sw04353-B_021914-022459 oh yeah so you're just really getting started [laughter] so do you have a family too
sw04353-B_022728-022965 oh yeah yeah
sw04353-B_023137-023385 she hasn't affected your budget yet really
sw04353-B_023385-024533 no no not like she will later on you'll you'll see that because_1 all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
sw04353-B_024533-025652 and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
sw04353-B_025652-026339 and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older
sw04353-B_026339-026599 um but um
sw04353-B_026599-026830 but what do you do do you
sw04353-B_027157-027318 oh okay
sw04353-B_027542-027780 oh well good good
sw04353-B_027780-028887 well we just have yeah we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta i guess we're not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook
sw04353-B_028887-029831 and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much
sw04354-A_000000-000531 what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control
sw04354-A_001227-001556 most and ten being no restrictions at all
sw04354-A_002404-003287 um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it [noise] it seems to me like there's there's
sw04354-A_003287-003973 it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know
sw04354-A_003973-004550 like hand guns and g[uns]- uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns
sw04354-A_004550-004713 so
sw04354-A_007090-007351 [laughter]
sw04354-A_007351-007938 and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and
sw04354-A_007938-008495 and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so [laughter] you know
sw04354-A_008495-008649 yeah [noise]
sw04354-A_009832-009971 um-hum
sw04354-A_011465-012013 [laughter] yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh
sw04354-A_012013-012346 i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
sw04354-A_012346-012792 a[nd]- and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so
sw04354-A_012792-013896 a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me [noise] i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it
sw04354-A_017077-017214 um-hum
sw04354-A_018206-018392 yeah they don't
sw04354-A_018829-019887 i guess i mean the only thing that i worr[y]- i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it
sw04354-A_019887-020724 is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
sw04354-A_020724-021642 but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway
sw04354-A_021642-022656 so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
sw04354-A_025298-026201 um-hum i think you might've had the i- i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because
sw04354-A_026201-026770 i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh
sw04354-A_026770-027548 if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
sw04354-A_027548-028007 that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
sw04354-A_028007-028246 least i'm not [laughter]
sw04354-A_028527-028672 yeah
sw04354-A_029235-029376 yeah
sw04354-B_000000-000112 [noise]
sw04354-B_000574-000821 uh [noise]
sw04354-B_000821-001312 one being maximum control or minimal control
sw04354-B_001640-002497 [laughter] that well i guess [noise] probably somewhere in the middle i've uh mixed feelings about it
sw04354-B_002497-002657 uh
sw04354-B_002854-002976 yeah
sw04354-B_003805-003971 [noise] right
sw04354-B_004438-004711 yeah yeah [noise]
sw04354-B_004711-006150 well um i ours my families from uh south Georgia and you know they hunt quite a bit so i- i really don't you know guns just something that you have [laughter] down there and uh
sw04354-B_006150-006758 uh so i- i tend to agree on that you know but uh
sw04354-B_006758-007205 assault rifles you know that's that's [laughter] made to
sw04354-B_007205-007503 made to kill somebody you know
sw04354-B_007503-007657 uh
sw04354-B_007767-008148 yeah so yeah i feel [noise]
sw04354-B_008148-008552 [laughter-yeah] right or cleaning
sw04354-B_008552-008678 but
sw04354-B_008678-009072 uh i i've heard some
sw04354-B_009072-010249 uh talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something
sw04354-B_010249-011486 and i don't i don't have a problem with that you know i think if you've got a if you've got a [laughter] history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly don't need a
sw04354-B_011486-011654 hand gun
sw04354-B_012277-012435 uh yeah
sw04354-B_012726-012858 right
sw04354-B_013008-013135 yeah
sw04354-B_013910-014507 well [noise] uh i think it it
sw04354-B_014507-015563 i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then
sw04354-B_015563-016116 uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but
sw04354-B_016116-017479 you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i- i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so uh obviously it's not gonna
sw04354-B_017479-018825 uh get rid of all all of your um illegal weapons out there or or dan[gerous]- you know get dangerous weapons out of people's hands but [noise] uh i think it'd help some
sw04354-B_020670-020800 yeah
sw04354-B_021300-021525 yeah no time
sw04354-B_021525-021685 right
sw04354-B_022331-022458 yeah
sw04354-B_022576-023928 yeah yeah i don't i don't really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but [noise] uh i think
sw04354-B_023928-025363 i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and [laughter] and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to
sw04354-B_026648-026769 yeah
sw04354-B_027457-027687 right yeah
sw04354-B_027882-028094 yeah usually not
sw04354-B_028094-028578 yeah i- i- i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it
sw04354-B_028578-029831 and uh i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and
sw04355-A_000000-000197 [noise] we're all set there um
sw04355-A_000197-000423 have you ever been tested for drugs
sw04355-A_000423-000663 yeah
sw04355-A_000663-001098 yeah i've worked in uh many jobs where it was a requirement to uh
sw04355-A_001098-001320 for the actual position
sw04355-A_001320-001687 i've worked for power plants across the country as a nuclear inspector
sw04355-A_001687-002045 and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug test
sw04355-A_002323-002550 just urine urine tests
sw04355-A_002550-002789 yeah checking for various types of drugs
sw04355-A_003658-003943 um i've heard of that happening
sw04355-A_003943-004477 i've from everything i've experienced the only way they've ever done it is urine tests
sw04355-A_004477-004566 yeah
sw04355-A_004783-004986 i would imagine it probably is
sw04355-A_005599-005893 um-hum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh
sw04355-A_005993-006086 work place
sw04355-A_007531-007725 um-hum
sw04355-A_008614-008702 um-hum
sw04355-A_008909-009230 anything dealing with the safety of the public or
sw04355-A_009454-009650 yeah i feel pretty strong about that too
sw04355-A_009650-010032 it's strange i the last job i had up in
sw04355-A_010032-010470 uh Plymouth New Hampshire it was for an accounts position
sw04355-A_010470-010941 and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job
sw04355-A_010941-011441 which i thought was rather unusual since i didn't really wasn't effecting the safety of the public at all
sw04355-A_011586-012333 but it i think it shows a growing trend uh in the work place to do drugs testing they don't want people who
sw04355-A_012333-012891 uh basically have that character[istic]- characteristic in there or that trait in their character
sw04355-A_013800-013972 wh[at]- excuse me i didn't hear that
sw04355-A_014756-015959 no i don't think so at all we we're uh recently at a little camp out with about fifteen people and w[ell]- i'm thirty one but l[ot]- a lot of the people that were there
sw04355-A_015959-016359 were in the twenty one to twenty four age group
sw04355-A_016359-017138 and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs because_1 that topic had come up they hadn't even experimented with it
sw04355-A_017138-017494 which i see as a good trend toward the future
sw04355-A_018244-018444 i think in the past there has been
sw04355-A_018444-018795 i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties
sw04355-A_018795-018925 um
sw04355-A_018925-019395 it almost became a a popular thing to j[ust]- to experiment and try it
sw04355-A_019395-019708 uh as far as users regular users
sw04355-A_019708-020215 um again it also depends on w[hat]- w[hat]- what areas you're looking at too
sw04355-A_020389-020684 i think in more in your subur[ban]- suburban areas
sw04355-A_020684-020878 i think you see less of it
sw04355-A_020878-021004 um
sw04355-A_021160-021719 and more in the cities uh it's more likely you're more likely to encounter that
sw04355-A_023403-024205 um i think it's not necessarily a losing battle but i don't think it's one you can win i think it's
sw04355-A_024205-024602 it's drugs have been around since the beginning of time just about
sw04355-A_024602-025069 um in one form or another people looking for a way to relax
sw04355-A_025069-025318 um unfortunately
sw04355-A_025318-026448 they're pe[ople]- the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs
sw04355-A_026448-027884 or relatively harmless and also our te[chnical]- our society has become more technical so that the when you use a drug the ramifications of uh si[de]- of uh a side effect harming other people has become more uh frequent
sw04355-A_028196-028838 you know the chance of getting into an automobile now a days and hurting someone being on drugs or in a plane if you're a pilot
sw04355-A_028838-028988 um
sw04355-A_028988-029217 it's pretty uh pretty high
sw04355-A_029217-029669 whereas three hundred years ago [laughter] the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse
sw04355-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04355-B_000051-000185 okay
sw04355-B_000361-000695 uh no i sure haven't huh-uh
sw04355-B_001619-001746 uh-huh
sw04355-B_002073-002359 what kind of test do they do i mean just
sw04355-B_002359-002475 for
sw04355-B_002475-002641 urine tests
sw04355-B_002795-003625 uh have you heard that they can test so far back as say six or seven months whether you've done drugs by uh taking some of your hair
sw04355-B_004376-004547 oh okay
sw04355-B_004547-004764 but is that possible though
sw04355-B_004956-005187 oh okay uh
sw04355-B_005187-005644 hm well no i've never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that
sw04355-B_005899-006057 work place
sw04355-B_006057-006711 uh i don't think it's really necessary it just depends on the type job it is
sw04355-B_006711-007107 if it's a job that's uh dealing with say
sw04355-B_007107-007245 uh
sw04355-B_007245-007589 like a pharmacy job or something like that maybe
sw04355-B_007589-008127 you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that
sw04355-B_008127-008384 but uh as far as just
sw04355-B_008384-008690 yeah every day job i would say no
sw04355-B_008690-008950 just certain categories i would say
sw04355-B_009179-009314 right
sw04355-B_009629-009748 yeah
sw04355-B_010418-010533 um-hum
sw04355-B_010878-010997 really
sw04355-B_011423-011659 hm that is unusual
sw04355-B_012850-012976 um
sw04355-B_012976-013870 but the thing is that do you think at s[ome]- some point you know probably about everyone ha[s]- ha[s]- experienced drugs of some type
sw04355-B_013870-014769 do you think that it's possible that uh about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you thi[nk]-
sw04355-B_016300-016448 um-hum
sw04355-B_017071-017200 oh that's
sw04355-B_017456-017615 right
sw04355-B_017615-018221 is it a pretty lar[ge]- so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right
sw04355-B_018416-018551 oh okay
sw04355-B_018750-018855 uh-huh
sw04355-B_019348-019455 right
sw04355-B_020180-020298 right
sw04355-B_020298-020401 right
sw04355-B_021667-021802 um-hum
sw04355-B_021802-022012 yeah that's true
sw04355-B_022012-023367 well what what do you think the chances of of drugs ever diminishing uh because a lot of it i feel that they catch the people that handling drugs but they're not catching the people that bring in drugs into the country
sw04355-B_023995-024149 um-hum
sw04355-B_025021-025156 um-hum
sw04355-B_026409-026534 hm
sw04355-B_027821-027977 hm
sw04355-B_027977-028170 that's interest[ing]-
sw04355-B_028780-028914 um-hum
sw04355-B_028914-029059 well that's true
sw04355-B_029613-029971 it sure was true uh
sw04356-A_000000-000275 [noise] so have you heard about Saturns
sw04356-A_001726-002197 ooh that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that i i'm thinking about
sw04356-A_002197-002759 we might get Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer
sw04356-A_002759-003171 yeah this this offshoot of GM [noise]
sw04356-A_003283-003642 and uh supposedly they've got great customer
sw04356-A_003642-003756 [noise]
sw04356-A_003756-004095 satisfaction from what things i've heard
sw04356-A_005374-005556 well like what
sw04356-A_006976-007111 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_008770-008870 yeah
sw04356-A_008979-009709 yeah i've got a sixty five Mustang and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself
sw04356-A_009709-010605 and when i look at modern cars and stuff like [vocalized-noise] i just say i will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything
sw04356-A_010706-011166 and it's so complicated too i look at it and i say boy you know i i'd have to almost
sw04356-A_011166-011411 go take a class or something like that
sw04356-A_011588-011717 um-hum
sw04356-A_012841-013009 uh-huh
sw04356-A_013009-013157 yeah
sw04356-A_013157-013309 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_014696-014813 yeah
sw04356-A_015361-015785 yeah that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about actually the car
sw04356-A_015785-016554 one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because_1 they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
sw04356-A_016707-016837 yeah
sw04356-A_017328-017465 uh-huh
sw04356-A_019301-019441 yeah
sw04356-A_019956-020781 ninety yep then or excuse me the ninety two's the ninety two's had dual air bags this newest model you could get them_1 with duals
sw04356-A_020915-021803 yeah but the thing is is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next
sw04356-A_021803-022419 year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things we'd like to get like a [noise]
sw04356-A_022419-023427 [noise] oh i don't know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that
sw04356-A_023427-023566 see if we can
sw04356-A_023765-024255 and the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too because they looked really nice
sw04356-A_025041-025936 well the the Saturns you can get air bags in them_1 i don't think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that i'm really
sw04356-A_025936-026052 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_026052-026586 i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not gonna fall apart that doesn't have problems
sw04356-A_026586-027258 you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the US auto
sw04356-A_027258-027881 makers when you do that because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and
sw04356-A_027881-028760 and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest US cars
sw04356-A_028760-029083 and the other one is are the Saturns
sw04356-A_029185-029469 so those two things and then you know
sw04356-A_029576-029841 we kind of want a four door
sw04356-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04356-B_000254-000598 i've heard some about Saturns i don't know
sw04356-B_000598-001810 a lot about them_1 i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them_1 although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the Japanese cars
sw04356-B_002674-002819 um-hum
sw04356-B_003031-003155 [laughter]
sw04356-B_003155-003300 yeah
sw04356-B_004032-004379 hm yeah i've heard a lot of people like them_1 uh
sw04356-B_004379-004822 yeah i don't know whether whether i would buy Saturn or not at this point i'm kind of
sw04356-B_004822-005050 my card and uh
sw04356-B_005050-005377 desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh
sw04356-B_005484-005909 well let's see i like i like cars that are
sw04356-B_005909-006935 designed with with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person whose working on it because_1 i do al[most]- almost all my own maintenance
sw04356-B_006935-007128 and uh
sw04356-B_007128-007860 those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh
sw04356-B_007860-008603 finding a car car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it just not very eas[y]- it's not very
sw04356-B_008603-008852 almost unlikely at this point
sw04356-B_008852-009008 and uh
sw04356-B_009008-009116 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-B_009227-009374 ooh
sw04356-B_009663-009801 um-hum
sw04356-B_010625-010751 yeah
sw04356-B_011287-011647 [laughter] well i've got an eighty three Saab
sw04356-B_011647-012445 and uh i find th[at]- for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on and so uh
sw04356-B_012445-013443 now i'm kind of spoiled i used to have an old uh Chevy uh with a three fifty in it and uh i really liked working on it
sw04356-B_013443-013827 ah cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy
sw04356-B_013827-014034 so i'm kind of uh
sw04356-B_014034-014708 biased in that and you know i want a car that i can work on because_1 i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
sw04356-B_014812-015315 and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing i'd look at i think another thing i'd look at is safety
sw04356-B_016390-016493 hm
sw04356-B_016493-016788 that's a real nice car i think
sw04356-B_016788-017007 i've driven some uh
sw04356-B_017007-017741 Tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips uh as rental cars and i've always been very impressed
sw04356-B_017741-018112 with the Tauruses it's a really nice car i think it's very
sw04356-B_018112-018582 it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive
sw04356-B_018582-018724 uh
sw04356-B_018724-019401 reasonable performance and this is out in California [laughter] where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore
sw04356-B_019401-020114 uh i've been real impressed with that y[ou]- you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
sw04356-B_020266-020397 um-hum
sw04356-B_020594-020735 well i think that
sw04356-B_020735-021040 that's excellent that's excellent because

sw04356-B_029780-029904 okay
sw04357-A_000000-000565 [noise] hi um the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and
sw04357-A_000565-001344 she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and
sw04357-A_001344-001620 yeah she had to have nurses care
sw04357-A_001620-002684 and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home
sw04357-A_002684-003393 but uh her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an IV and things
sw04357-A_003956-004142 oh wow
sw04357-A_004142-004370 oh my goodness
sw04357-A_005050-005190 uh-huh
sw04357-A_005872-006125 and then there's just the grandkids
sw04357-A_006539-006734 oh wow
sw04357-A_007063-007622 yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything
sw04357-A_008061-008517 yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and
sw04357-A_008517-009665 his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed
sw04357-A_009665-010816 and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldn't get up or anything but she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and she never did [laughter]
sw04357-A_010816-011326 oh yeah uh she has osteopor[osis]- [vocalized-noise] i don't know how to say it
sw04357-A_011326-012335 anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she
sw04357-A_012335-012881 she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home
sw04357-A_012997-013779 but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night
sw04357-A_013779-013956 and she only
sw04357-A_013956-014565 [laughter] well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming
sw04357-A_014565-015214 and i you know we felt really bad for putting her [laughter-there] [laughter-and] stuff she was unconscious and so
sw04357-A_015214-015580 i don't know a lot of people say she didn't even know she was there but
sw04357-A_015580-015874 still it was nice to be with her and stuff
sw04357-A_016216-017191 well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they can't afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for
sw04357-A_017356-017706 you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just
sw04357-A_017706-018645 taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they can't afford a rest home or whatever
sw04357-A_018645-019044 and that does a double toll on the kids
sw04357-A_019176-019537 i don't know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but
sw04357-A_019643-020014 i don't know how we would afford it either
sw04357-A_020573-020756 uh-huh
sw04357-A_021941-022091 uh-huh
sw04357-A_022601-022791 uh-huh [noise]
sw04357-A_023748-023929 oh really

sw04357-A_026925-027370 [laughter] that is a challenge [laughter]
sw04357-A_027370-028746 [laughter] that and you know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i don't know i i would never want to be in a rest home
sw04357-A_028746-028975 i really don't think i'd want to

sw04357-B_017675-017769 uh-huh
sw04357-B_018976-019169 uh-huh
sw04357-B_019169-019402 [noise]
sw04357-B_019948-020222 i remember one time i was uh
sw04357-B_020222-020601 [laughter] i was in a Mexican restaurant here in Seattle
sw04357-B_020601-021839 and uh i i was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and i overheard some [noise] folks in the next booth who i think some of them worked at the restaurant they were
sw04357-B_021839-022651 a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i don't know whether they were from Mexico or or but they were you know definitely Latin American
sw04357-B_022651-023341 they were talking about the differences between uh how uh our country cares for old people and what it was like back home
sw04357-B_023341-023873 and they were just appalled that anybody could [laughter] put somebody in a you know in a rest home
sw04357-B_023873-024744 yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about uh where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families
sw04357-B_024744-025299 where you know the the old people were uh were at home
sw04357-B_025400-025945 yeah and uh most people don't want to live that way today [laughter] in this country [laughter]
sw04357-B_026122-026502 yeah [laughter] God
sw04357-B_026502-027015 yeah i don't know i and i've been single so long i don't even know if i could handle living with a wife
sw04357-B_027015-027202 [laughter]
sw04357-B_027202-027473 i'm probably [vocalized-noise] incorrigible you know
sw04357-B_027473-027546 [laughter]
sw04357-B_028297-028433 yeah
sw04357-B_028736-028896 uh-huh
sw04357-B_029021-029400 well my grandma's in a retirement community now and uh
sw04357-B_029400-029720 seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and
sw04358-A_000000-000432 [noise] okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
sw04358-A_001477-002417 uh-huh [noise] well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but
sw04358-A_002417-003216 i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
sw04358-A_003765-003882 uh-huh
sw04358-A_005589-006732 i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort
sw04358-A_006732-007491 whether and and i think that and i know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
sw04358-A_007491-008672 and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that i know of anyways
sw04358-A_008672-009626 where people aren't really you know ecoconscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and i'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
sw04358-A_009626-009947 but uh people need to be more conscious of it
sw04358-A_011712-013038 yeah [noise] no it it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries t[o]- for it to go through
sw04358-A_013038-014093 but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would dr[ink]- have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so
sw04358-A_014093-015561 it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing
sw04358-A_015561-015926 and that's the big thing i think that th[ey]- they try to promote
sw04358-A_017771-017962 yeah that's a good idea
sw04358-A_017962-018120 yeah
sw04358-A_018222-018909 th[ere]- there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at wh[ere]- where i work i work for a defense contractor
sw04358-A_018909-019930 and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage
sw04358-A_019930-020718 because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh
sw04358-A_020718-022052 uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh you know uh uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so i[t]- i[t]- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
sw04358-A_024145-025363 yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa[per]- the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it
sw04358-A_025363-025720 because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh
sw04358-A_025720-026966 [noise] trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a d[ump]- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
sw04358-A_026966-027378 because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
sw04358-A_027992-028112 yeah
sw04358-A_028878-029007 yeah
sw04358-A_029400-029524 yeah
sw04358-A_029694-029923 okay
sw04358-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04358-B_000442-001467 uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
sw04358-B_003346-004430 well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets
sw04358-B_004430-005621 as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
sw04358-B_009573-009811 right they
sw04358-B_009926-010870 th[ey're]- here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh
sw04358-B_010870-011808 the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
sw04358-B_015988-016395 right i think here that if they uh
sw04358-B_016395-017469 instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh
sw04358-B_017469-018235 you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
sw04358-B_022114-022894 uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh
sw04358-B_022894-024073 usually have them come from [vocalized-noise] you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual [laughter]
sw04358-B_024073-024244 trash
sw04358-B_027290-028403 well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the
sw04358-B_028403-028928 uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
sw04358-B_028928-029439 now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
sw04359-A_000000-000075 [noise]
sw04359-A_000075-000215 are you there
sw04359-A_000215-000601 well i guess it sounds like you have children in the background there
sw04359-A_000601-000961 yeah what kind of child care have you found for them
sw04359-A_001221-001368 uh-huh
sw04359-A_001540-001677 i see
sw04359-A_001899-002124 uh-huh it is expensive
sw04359-A_002124-002573 wha[t]- what kind uh through the military what kind of prices do you pay for child care there
sw04359-A_002573-003699 forty five a week i'm from the Bay area and uh just not even um well known schools in child care here people are paying two hundred two hundred fifty a week
sw04359-A_003806-004722 no i don't know how they do it i'm i stay at home i'm a mother i stay at home with mine but i know that it's uh really expensive here
sw04359-A_004722-005406 what types of things have you looked for when you're um when you were looking in f[or]- to the child care there
sw04359-A_005539-005686 uh-huh
sw04359-A_005930-006102 it doesn't
sw04359-A_006976-007211 uh-huh i understand that
sw04359-A_007608-007858 uh-huh right
sw04359-A_007993-008141 right
sw04359-A_008329-008462 um-hum

sw04359-A_009324-009459 uh-huh

sw04359-A_026194-026840 yeah my um i guess uh i was surprised to hear the prices of the day care here um
sw04359-A_026840-027727 being two two and i'm sure even in some of the nicer i'm not i'm talking uh San Jose area the nicer areas Paolo Alto more as it gets more expensive
sw04359-A_027727-028356 you probably pay them_1 i w[ould]- assume you pay them_1 more just because they're overhead in the day you know their renting in these day care places
sw04359-A_028356-028860 you know the overhead for th[e]- for uh you know just paying their rent in the buildings

sw04359-B_000125-000290 i sure am
sw04359-B_000511-000727 yes i do [laughter]
sw04359-B_000870-001295 uh we're military so we take him to a military day care

sw04359-B_005316-005604 well i've had several different kinds of day care
sw04359-B_005604-006013 i had a friend taking care of him and that doesn't work
sw04359-B_006013-007106 no um y[our]- your beliefs are different and i- i guess they become you you can't um make demands that you can when you're paying for it
sw04359-B_007106-007755 and i'm i'm not talking severe demands i'm talking things like i have to have you on Wednesday you know what i mean

sw04359-B_009638-009785 yes
sw04359-B_009785-010226 yes and i['m]- i'm just not willing to expose my child to that
sw04359-B_010226-010909 i mean i- i want him to be i want him to be stimulated and interested
sw04359-B_011471-011604 yes
sw04359-B_011751-012332 preschool only half a day half a day is kind of geared toward those kind of things
sw04359-B_012332-013167 and every week is divided like this week they're doing spring and then next week they may do kites and all week they'll have things about this
sw04359-B_013167-013878 not only they talk about kites they talk about the different colors on kites they talk cultural aspects the shapes
sw04359-B_013878-014100 uh you know it's wonderful
sw04359-B_015236-015400 it is frightening
sw04359-B_016320-017043 it is Robert's day care has um close camera watch on the children you know what [noise] i mean so it's monitored
sw04359-B_017043-017731 plus they have um this is military so they have doctors come in and do checkups on the kids uh Texas

sw04359-B_018712-019150 i mean it's a continual rotation of resources
sw04359-B_019713-020503 it is and they don't change day care people at a[ll]- i mean my son has been in there now a year and he has the same teacher
sw04359-B_020989-021392 and you know why they keep these people they pay them more
sw04359-B_021746-021901 they do
sw04359-B_022585-023005 oh i know they need they need um
sw04359-B_023005-023658 yes they nee[d]- and they need this person is taking care of some of those things that i can't give my child

sw04359-B_025296-025470 i am
sw04359-B_025849-026259 very lucky i have to admit i don't know what i'd do without it
sw04359-B_026721-026890 oh i know
sw04359-B_027648-027830 oh no
sw04359-B_028270-028427 um-hum
sw04359-B_028792-029294 my sister lives in Austin and she has the most wonderful home health care
sw04359-B_029294-029856 lady who does this for a living so she has six children that's all she can have by law
sw04359-B_029856-029939 and
sw04360-A_000000-000149 [noise] um
sw04360-A_000296-000534 let's see how about um
sw04360-A_000749-000994 let's see about ten years ago
sw04360-A_000994-001218 um
sw04360-A_001218-001548 what do you think was different ten years ago from now
sw04360-A_002456-002605 um-hum
sw04360-A_004047-004205 uh-huh
sw04360-A_005084-005434 what do you well uh
sw04360-A_005434-005971 actually ten years from today seems rather short
sw04360-A_005971-006098 um
sw04360-A_006200-006535 but i do agree that uh generally it's
sw04360-A_006535-006772 society has sort of
sw04360-A_006772-006976 uh
sw04360-A_006976-007334 let's see rushed everything ahead
sw04360-A_007334-007562 and uh
sw04360-A_007562-008629 i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
sw04360-A_008629-008993 but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
sw04360-A_009544-009683 uh
sw04360-A_010219-010610 hm it depends uh
sw04360-A_010610-010869 it's hard to say because i think
sw04360-A_010869-011210 people were busy ten [laughter-twenty] years ago too
sw04360-A_011210-011386 um
sw04360-A_011662-011790 i just
sw04360-A_012039-012200 i'm twenty eight
sw04360-A_012300-012417 yeah
sw04360-A_012575-012700 yeah
sw04360-A_012808-013410 i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
sw04360-A_013410-014198 and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
sw04360-A_014198-015166 and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
sw04360-A_015962-016293 i think that's part of it too but i do think
sw04360-A_016497-016626 [noise]
sw04360-A_016748-016971 no no i don't
sw04360-A_016971-017420 no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that
sw04360-A_017420-017528 that
sw04360-A_017528-017747 that really do need to work
sw04360-A_017747-018206 i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
sw04360-A_018206-019188 just to [noise] survive and then there th[at]- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
sw04360-A_019188-020309 they think is is surviving [laughter] which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that
sw04360-A_020309-021224 it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
sw04360-A_021603-022447 i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
sw04360-A_022447-023087 is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
sw04360-A_023087-023965 because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
sw04360-A_023965-024298 the uh decreasing um
sw04360-A_024401-024646 middle class in this country
sw04360-A_024646-025043 i think that that's in my opinion the case
sw04360-A_025043-025214 so
sw04360-A_025214-025490 i mean i have met people that
sw04360-A_025490-025798 uh both that [noise]
sw04360-A_025798-026346 that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
sw04360-A_026490-026608 so
sw04360-A_027491-027639 um-hum
sw04360-A_028740-028875 uh-huh
sw04360-A_029499-029617 right
sw04360-B_000000-000079 [noise]
sw04360-B_001551-002010 well i would say as far as social changes go um
sw04360-B_002010-002908 i think families were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um
sw04360-B_002908-004120 th[e]- the parents usually took out time um you know more time than they do now to come with the children an[d]- and just spend the day doing a family activity
sw04360-B_004120-005003 um although i'm not a mother i i still think that um a lot has changed since ten years ago
sw04360-B_005003-005249 um what do you think about that
sw04360-B_005892-006019 yeah
sw04360-B_007247-007377 um-hum
sw04360-B_008934-009530 yes what about like as far as um social changes in the individual
sw04360-B_009530-010215 do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago
sw04360-B_011097-011240 um-hum
sw04360-B_011876-012115 well how how old are you
sw04360-B_012115-012350 twenty eight okay i'm twenty three
sw04360-B_012350-012662 so there's maybe a five year gap between us
sw04360-B_012662-012833 so um
sw04360-B_013181-013287 huh
sw04360-B_013390-013506 yes
sw04360-B_014163-014288 um-hum
sw04360-B_015131-016041 do you think it's an economic c[risis]- necessity or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
sw04360-B_016454-016810 i mean do you think people really need two cars and
sw04360-B_016810-017062 a house in the suburbs or
sw04360-B_017399-017525 um-hum
sw04360-B_017692-017823 um-hum
sw04360-B_018471-018603 yeah
sw04360-B_018743-018874 um-hum
sw04360-B_018975-019116 okay
sw04360-B_019715-019844 um-hum
sw04360-B_021247-021477 you so you think it's
sw04360-B_021477-021825 uh which group are you saying is the one trying
sw04360-B_022373-022504 um-hum
sw04360-B_024560-024713 um-hum
sw04360-B_024829-024946 [noise]
sw04360-B_024946-025101 okay
sw04360-B_026321-026824 okay and then sometimes i i often uh find that
sw04360-B_026824-027603 maybe there's so many different things available to us [vocalized-noise] a microwave a VCR a answering machine um
sw04360-B_027603-028286 you know a special a dishwasher um a refrigerator and some of those items um
sw04360-B_028286-028877 for the for the um well i guess we're sticking more to social changes but um
sw04360-B_028877-029572 people want all of that and not all of those are necessities
sw04360-B_029572-029741 so they're trying to
sw04360-B_029741-029911 it has become a necessity
sw04361-A_000000-000182 [noise] so what do you think
sw04361-A_000353-000569 [laughter] absolutely
sw04361-A_000856-000961 [vocalized-noise]
sw04361-A_001563-001697 uh-huh
sw04361-A_002483-002616 uh-huh
sw04361-A_003274-003389 um-hum
sw04361-A_003528-003776 yeah are your um
sw04361-A_003776-004025 schools paid for primarily with your real estate tax
sw04361-A_004025-004510 yeah what for a typical middle class house uh what kind of annual tax do you pay
sw04361-A_005010-005288 well i know it's split federal and so forth
sw04361-A_005500-005652 uh-huh
sw04361-A_005652-005775 um-hum
sw04361-A_005928-006035 they are
sw04361-A_006145-006573 oh okay okay because_1 um over here
sw04361-A_006573-007112 um you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year
sw04361-A_007112-007373 and um
sw04361-A_007373-007835 [noise] i'd be surprised if we're getting something that was ten times as good as what you're getting
sw04361-A_007835-008109 matter of fact i'll bet it's not as good
sw04361-A_008109-008468 um my feeling is that
sw04361-A_008575-009035 there you know while there are certain problems where
sw04361-A_009035-010158 you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong
sw04361-A_010958-011398 well again i don't know what it's like on your side of the fence um over here
sw04361-A_011398-012167 um teachers' salaries aren't bad uh they're not executive type salaries although if you're a
sw04361-A_012167-013001 teacher whose been at it for fifteen twenty years uh you can retire [vocalized-noise] when you when you reach the top level it's not bad at all it's quite good
sw04361-A_013001-013144 um
sw04361-A_013305-013433 yeah
sw04361-A_013433-014194 thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system
sw04361-A_014194-014999 um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young
sw04361-A_014999-015487 um now it seems th[at]- you know now the the joke of the year is you know those who can't teach
sw04361-A_015487-016328 and um you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think it's felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside
sw04361-A_016328-016675 there's a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray
sw04361-A_016675-016904 called In Pursuit of Happiness
sw04361-A_016904-017454 and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system
sw04361-A_017454-017676 and um
sw04361-A_017676-018598 he even offers some suggestions for improvements uh one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems
sw04361-A_018598-019426 uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective
sw04361-A_019529-020902 in other words if you decide that you're gonna pump another ten percent money in it'll right eventually filter down it filters it's way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level um if you provide other benefits
sw04361-A_020902-021439 they'll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them
sw04361-A_021439-021747 i'm not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points
sw04361-A_022313-022454 um-hum
sw04361-A_022454-022590 [noise] yeah
sw04361-A_023130-023822 well it did change the thing to do is find out uh why um because_1 uh
sw04361-A_023822-024878 you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed um and in[trinsically]- intrinsically the ideas you know um training our
sw04361-A_024878-025532 the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh
sw04361-A_025532-025846 a very um what's the right word
sw04361-A_025846-027154 um it's potentially a very re[warding]- not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no [vocalized-noise] why isn't it but well it should be what's preventing it from being respected
sw04361-A_027154-027288 now
sw04361-A_027288-028418 absolutely absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and um she brings home some interesting stories uh but the thing that you know i- i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid
sw04361-A_028418-028890 uh [laughter-i'm] [laughter-just] [laughter-saying] that but the thing that changed is
sw04361-A_028890-029067 um
sw04361-A_029217-029930 back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didn't do your work but you respected or at least feared the t[eacher]-
sw04361-B_000000-000108 [noise] okay
sw04361-B_000216-000783 well that's a pretty loaded topic [laughter] well here in um
sw04361-B_000783-001072 hang on just a second the dog is barking
sw04361-B_001072-001835 okay here in Oklahoma we just went through a uh major educational reform we're uh that was a hot topic
sw04361-B_001835-002557 uh part of the problem had been there wasn't enough spent on education the classes were too large
sw04361-B_002557-003658 and we recently well we're we're through a proposition now where they're limiting class size to about twenty two i think and they've increased salaries and just done a major revision
sw04361-B_003976-004234 yes yeah it's just about all
sw04361-B_004529-005129 [noise] oh well actually the actually it isn't just [vocalized-noise] i- i said yes and it really isn't w[e]-
sw04361-B_005129-006264 we also well no we have a uh an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range
sw04361-B_006973-007156 [noise] right
sw04361-B_007813-007951 [noise] yeah
sw04361-B_008059-008214 right
sw04361-B_010160-011007 yeah i- i do have to tend to agree with you the only other problem with that is that it's difficult to attract people into the teaching profession
sw04361-B_011184-011294 hm
sw04361-B_012921-013500 yeah yeah i think that's that's the other thing here the benefits are [noise] very good for teachers where
sw04361-B_014768-014898 right
sw04361-B_015456-015593 right
sw04361-B_016852-016990 um-hum
sw04361-B_019452-019575 yeah
sw04361-B_021698-022772 [noise] yeah that does i- i think though you hit the the nail on the head [noise] when you when you said it's the attitude more than anything of the teacher profession the teaching profession um
sw04361-B_022772-023184 and that that's something you really can't change even with money
sw04361-B_024184-024297 um-hum
sw04361-B_026392-026518 yeah
sw04361-B_027012-027113 right
sw04361-B_027113-027532 right it's a it's a pretty big responsibility i mean to to teach
sw04361-B_027652-027785 um-hum
sw04361-B_028547-028676 yeah
sw04361-B_029868-029930 [noise]
sw04362-A_004627-005650 i don't know um i haven't it's been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um
sw04362-A_005650-005964 [vocalized-noise] i've seen things change
sw04362-A_005964-006993 i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what i mean
sw04362-A_006993-007184 but um
sw04362-A_007184-008091 it seems like [vocalized-noise] when i li[ved]- i lived in Chicago i've i've lived down here i hear the dropout rates from the schools
sw04362-A_008091-008557 and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year
sw04362-A_008557-008913 and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth
sw04362-A_008913-009369 i mean i i've seen so many different things
sw04362-A_009369-010572 so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people
sw04362-A_010572-010749 but um
sw04362-A_010749-011160 i don't i don't understand the um
sw04362-A_011160-011862 i don't understand i guess why the schools don['t]- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities
sw04362-A_017892-018922 i don't know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system
sw04362-A_018922-019100 um
sw04362-A_019100-020203 yeah [vocalized-noise] i don't blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than
sw04362-A_020203-020664 well [noise] they do quite well for themselves [laughter]
sw04362-A_021287-022150 no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid i mean i know one family that's got they're both teachers
sw04362-A_022150-023348 and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer full-time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
sw04362-A_023348-024254 i mean that family is making over a hundred grand and i'm i mean okay okay yes i agree that teaching our kids is important
sw04362-A_024254-025250 however these people who only work eight hours a day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
sw04362-A_025250-025790 and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that and i don't even have kids [laughter]
sw04362-B_000000-000833 [noise] uh well [noise] uh having sort of recently gone through the school system i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing i'm i'm just graduating coll[ege]-
sw04362-B_000833-001935 graduating from college uh i didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like
sw04362-B_001935-002621 they have in Japan and a[gain]- you can compare just about everyth[ing]- thing to Japan and we look like w[e]- we don't have anything
sw04362-B_002621-003456 [noise] um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough
sw04362-B_003456-004611 um however i if it weren't for our needless uh [noise] competition with Japan i i'd i'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace
sw04362-B_005300-005445 um-hum
sw04362-B_006850-006990 right
sw04362-B_008473-008610 yeah
sw04362-B_008872-009009 hm
sw04362-B_010109-010231 right
sw04362-B_010231-010349 [noise]
sw04362-B_010349-010516 [noise]
sw04362-B_011902-013060 [noise] uh well i- i don't pretend to understand that either uh but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put
sw04362-B_013060-013466 um because the the dropout rate is
sw04362-B_013466-014785 in those areas it's it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle
sw04362-B_014785-015361 whether wherever you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions
sw04362-B_015361-016631 that things ought to get better so uh a[nd]- the other two a[ll]- oh they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to
sw04362-B_016631-017901 to fix but it's just like i i don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like i don't know it's it's a complicated issue i i still don't think i would d[irectly]- blame it directly on the school
sw04362-B_018932-019172 well that's what i meant when i said the school
sw04362-B_020560-021244 hm well that that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid
sw04362-B_022426-022568 um-hum
sw04362-B_023332-023534 yeah well it it
sw04362-B_024199-024329 right
sw04362-B_025662-026857 yeah w[ell]- w[ell]- well that's true but that there's you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong
sw04362-B_026857-027783 but when you're talk [vocalized-noise] and there's really not much you can directly do about that i think that that if if there is a problem with the school system [noise]
sw04362-B_027783-028412 uh from m[y]- it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh
sw04362-B_028412-029719 uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh wh[ere]- you have other professional jobs and thi[s]- this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on
sw04363-A_000000-000350 [noise] wha[t]- what's your uh you are you into the Cowboys or what
sw04363-A_000350-000550 [laughter]
sw04363-A_001063-001326 oh yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04363-A_001326-001491 that's all right
sw04363-A_002037-002155 yeah
sw04363-A_002281-002625 well i don't know i kind of go back and forth uh
sw04363-A_002625-003370 depending on whose really hot and whose not i guess i'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects but uh
sw04363-A_003370-004060 i guess if i have uh my druthers [noise] i'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks i kind of like them
sw04363-A_004161-004351 yeah they're kind of
sw04363-A_004673-004777 you
sw04363-A_005153-006025 yeah to be honest with you i- i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro yeah i kind of like college actually quite a bit
sw04363-A_006365-006472 is it
sw04363-A_006590-006692 [noise]
sw04363-A_007310-007496 yeah yeah that could be
sw04363-A_007763-007883 yeah
sw04363-A_008506-008862 yeah you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then
sw04363-A_008862-008957 [laughter]
sw04363-A_008957-009208 no i root for Nebraska quite a bit
sw04363-A_009208-009326 [noise] yeah
sw04363-A_009326-009501 [laughter]
sw04363-A_009785-010721 yeah well i can see i can see definitely how you could get into that i to be honest with you i find that that too much running gets pretty boring as well and
sw04363-A_010900-011044 right
sw04363-A_011733-011874 sure
sw04363-A_011874-012684 well i think they're starting to realize that a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
sw04363-A_012907-013048 right
sw04363-A_013172-014074 ye[ah]- yeah so uh what's a this World League is coming in uh that's getting ready to start up right have you followed that very much or
sw04363-A_014368-014499 yeah
sw04363-A_015193-015319 yeah
sw04363-A_015738-016161 right it can take over a small market share but nothing really
sw04363-A_016781-016885 right
sw04363-A_017050-017497 yeah i think i agree with you it's it's kind of interesting to see uh
sw04363-A_017497-018285 to see their claim of you know like world football but when in reality it's really Americans playing [laughter-somewhere] [laughter-else] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04363-A_018471-018597 [noise]
sw04363-A_018854-019908 yeah actually uh i kind of like soccer i've never really played it but uh i like the idea it's it's an interesting game to watch that and rugby i like to watch rugby every now
sw04363-A_020012-020259 yeah whatever you wanna call it there
sw04363-A_020409-020564 [laughter-yeah]
sw04363-A_020564-020713 [laughter]
sw04363-A_020713-021203 yeah there's an element of there's definitely an element of stupidity in there [laughter-somewhere]
sw04363-A_021398-021571 [noise] yeah
sw04363-A_021990-022332 right exactly [noise] yeah that
sw04363-A_022579-022725 yeah
sw04363-A_022725-022951 you've played it then
sw04363-A_023341-023730 no i doubt it you know not least not in this country anyway
sw04363-A_023871-024021 yeah it is
sw04363-A_024426-024583 [laughter]
sw04363-A_024705-024903 they really are yeah
sw04363-A_025565-025859 uh no i don't to tell you the truth i'm
sw04363-A_026416-026825 okay to tell you the truth i'm not even really from here
sw04363-A_026825-027463 yeah i'm i'm up here for a year on an internship but i- i actually live in Florida
sw04363-A_027463-027634 yeah
sw04363-A_027634-027802 well you know i
sw04363-A_027802-027918 [laughter]
sw04363-A_027918-028103 i mean who who
sw04363-A_028265-028532 who the heck is gonna root for Tampa Bay right
sw04363-A_028532-028681 [laughter]
sw04363-A_028681-029907 i mean i guess i could go for Miami but i don't know i'm from i root for Nebraska so i'm i don't have a real love for [laughter-Miami] anyway but i don't know i like i said i- i get into pretty much any game that's out
sw04363-B_000000-000228 [noise] uh so
sw04363-B_000228-000454 oh God no [laughter]
sw04363-B_000454-001114 uh no i i'm not i haven't been i grew up in Dallas but i'm still not a Cowboys' man i like Philadelphia Eagles
sw04363-B_001114-002317 yeah that's my favorite team so uh now Randall's coming back next season i hope they'll be do a little bit better they didn't do too bad last season but i hope they can do better how about yourself
sw04363-B_003010-003168 uh-huh
sw04363-B_003842-004644 oh [vocalized-noise] yeah that's another one of my favorites they're not they're not my favorite totally but i do like them i like
sw04363-B_004644-005362 yeah Seahawks are good they now that Steve Largent's gone i kind of lose a little bit for them_1 but you know he
sw04363-B_005645-005776 really
sw04363-B_005776-005883 huh
sw04363-B_005883-007307 yeah that's kind of that's kind of strange it's too much running for me in in college football i like i like the pros they do you know it's more high tech more you know pl[ayers]- players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just
sw04363-B_007307-008054 you know when you getting paid millions to do it you ac[tually]- i think they take it to another level but i can see it's more you know
sw04363-B_008054-008575 grunted out run the ball type college football it's a little bit different but
sw04363-B_008770-009055 who whose that [vocalized-noise] Notre Dame
sw04363-B_009055-009960 Ne[braska]- Nebraska [laughter-yeah] there's a running team yeah that's that that's boring for me i i'll take the passing teams any day but
sw04363-B_010583-011959 yeah it just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle that's it you know it gets kind of monotonous after awhile i- i prefer forty i've asked forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit and
sw04363-B_011959-012073 but
sw04363-B_012584-013255 yeah it's high dollar you know it's all it's all money now even college is all can we get on TV so
sw04363-B_013255-013407 that's that
sw04363-B_013783-013957 right yeah
sw04363-B_013957-014416 uh not really i- i don't think anything will ever take over the NFL i think
sw04363-B_014416-014874 it's basically you know it's it's an institution it's like if we try to start
sw04363-B_014874-015463 something to take over major league baseball it's just i just you know i mean it it it can be
sw04363-B_015463-015904 it can take over part of it but it's never gonna be the next
sw04363-B_015904-017117 yeah it's yeah it's gonna take a little bit some people are gonna watch it but it's not gonna be wide spread Super Bowl and every Sunday m[ourning]- afternoon or anything you know it's just it's never gonna reach that that standard but
sw04363-B_018062-018311 [laughter-yeah] yeah it's kind of
sw04363-B_018311-018919 kind of strange huh i guess we're the only ones who take it that far everybody else still nuts over soccer but
sw04363-B_019129-019243 yeah
sw04363-B_019729-019827 [laughter]
sw04363-B_019827-020118 yeah or Australian rules football that's some
sw04363-B_020118-020920 yeah that's some brutal stuff there that's that's worse than football as far as violence i think golly those guys kill each other out there rugby something else
sw04363-B_021065-021470 [laughter-ye[ah]-] [laughter-yeah] that's just wild that's why it's a goo[d]- big college thing
sw04363-B_021470-022083 rugby's definitely big in college because_1 it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and [laughter-do]
sw04363-B_022083-022171 [laughter]
sw04363-B_022171-023413 so yeah i could see the feel for that but it's it's pretty it's fun to play i'll give it that it is fun to play if you don't value your body very much but you know uh i don't think rugby will ever be professional but
sw04363-B_023413-023620 it's it's it's
sw04363-B_023620-023955 no you can't stay healthy and do that that's a rough game
sw04363-B_023955-024055 but
sw04363-B_024055-025353 uh i don't know i- i don't know how my Eagles are gonna do this year so you the the Seahawks are an up and down [laughter-kind] of team yeah i my my it's it's kind of odd my roommate that i live with here he's uh he's
sw04363-B_025353-026494 lived in Pennock Minnesota you know where that is it's it's it's a small town it's about two hours it's in like central Minnesota it's a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis
sw04363-B_026494-026635 but uh
sw04363-B_026751-026939 you just live there now
sw04363-B_027101-027289 uh-huh well he's
sw04363-B_027395-027781 live in Florida like the Seahawks [laughter]
sw04363-B_027781-027886 [laughter]
sw04363-B_027886-028387 hey i['ve]- i've i've i've only been to Philadelphia twice and i you know i- i still like
sw04363-B_028498-028595 [laughter]
sw04363-B_028595-028796 really really
sw04363-B_028796-029055 yeah but i don't
sw04363-B_029322-029471 [laughter]
sw04363-B_029471-029561 [vocalized-noise]
sw04364-A_000000-000367 [noise] so do you your privacy being invaded at any time
sw04364-A_002231-002374 [vocalized-noise]
sw04364-A_002592-002730 right
sw04364-A_005307-005447 yep
sw04364-A_005447-006117 yep there's a lot that you you can still yeah i have always done that i started once i found out that that's really
sw04364-A_006117-006674 not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do
sw04364-A_006674-007325 you gonna say you don't wanna sell me this product then that's fine i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all
sw04364-A_007325-007795 and then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down [laughter]
sw04364-A_007795-008148 but uh really it's part of this compliance thing
sw04364-A_008148-008956 uh the thing i don't like i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles
sw04364-A_009057-009311 that really burns me because
sw04364-A_009311-009654 hey you're required you have to do that
sw04364-A_009654-009826 and
sw04364-A_009826-010756 nowhere does it say you ha[ve]- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
sw04364-A_010756-012058 and i think that's it it's one thing [vocalized-noise] voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody
sw04364-A_012160-012500 you know i don't think i don't think they have the right to do that
sw04364-A_018156-018533 well that's easy whenever you donate money to someone
sw04364-A_018533-019159 they you become [laughter] put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or
sw04364-A_019159-020058 solicitations and then you st[art]- [vocalized-noise] it kind of makes you feel deeded from doing it again like uh National Public Radio or
sw04364-A_020058-020759 any of these the public uh stations you know i- i- i- i think i sent in in money for
sw04364-A_020759-020933 once
sw04364-A_020933-021353 to uh to public uh TV
sw04364-A_021353-022226 and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine i it's like
sw04364-A_022226-022867 and it just started soon after i had done that once and i just said this is this is terrible
sw04364-A_022867-023587 um and that's also happened to me where as i've given money to my old Alma Mater in college
sw04364-A_023587-024201 and uh it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is uh
sw04364-A_024201-024791 then they start getting uh other people to the people do these {phonathons} and they call you up
sw04364-A_024791-026162 and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed X amount last year can you do better this year
sw04364-A_026162-026777 and you know like hold on here who how do you know that why why you even telling me this
sw04364-A_026777-027676 is it any of your business i mean it's one thing that i and the colleges knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who's soliciting should know it all
sw04364-A_027676-027992 just uh and that was very offensive too
sw04364-A_028097-028202 [vocalized-noise]
sw04364-A_028431-028564 uh-huh
sw04364-A_028667-028840 right
sw04364-B_000000-000101 [noise]
sw04364-B_000299-000638 well one of the things that uh
sw04364-B_000638-001954 that i found to be uh an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the
sw04364-B_001954-002240 on the uh credit card bill
sw04364-B_002240-002867 that is something that is not required and in fact uh
sw04364-B_002867-003577 it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many [noise] people from uh from doing it
sw04364-B_003577-003794 and it's [vocalized-noise]
sw04364-B_003794-004954 one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research and to get the your your phone number on uh
sw04364-B_004954-005359 uh lists for phone solicitations
sw04364-B_006894-007025 um-hum
sw04364-B_008047-008197 um-hum
sw04364-B_008908-009049 um-hum
sw04364-B_009613-009741 right
sw04364-B_010693-010829 um-hum
sw04364-B_012087-012276 right uh that
sw04364-B_012426-013174 i agree with you there that's something that uh people have seen oh here's an easy way to make some money
sw04364-B_013174-013966 but uh [vocalized-noise] i don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not i've i've heard
sw04364-B_013966-014243 fairly recently uh
sw04364-B_014243-015270 some talk about that in this in in my state ah the budget problems up here are are pretty tense and people are looking for
sw04364-B_015270-016421 alternate ways of uh you know enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use and they were talking about selling the DMV lists and there was a lot of uh
sw04364-B_016421-016644 a lot of uh
sw04364-B_016644-017314 consternation about that and the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea
sw04364-B_017314-017413 but
sw04364-B_017413-018235 it really makes you wonder what other lists you're on that have been made uh public that you don't know about
sw04364-B_018457-018589 um-hum
sw04364-B_019066-019235 right
sw04364-B_019755-019893 um-hum
sw04364-B_020319-020455 um-hum
sw04364-B_021245-021381 um-hum
sw04364-B_021971-022091 hm
sw04364-B_022516-022650 right
sw04364-B_023571-023693 um-hum
sw04364-B_024622-024761 right
sw04364-B_026349-026550 how do you know that [noise]
sw04364-B_027433-027567 um-hum
sw04364-B_028079-029199 last year the uh Lotus Development Company the uh company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a uh cd-rom
sw04364-B_029199-029651 with peoples names sorted by
sw04364-B_029651-029885 number of different criteria
sw04365-A_000000-000277 all right i guess well we're recording now
sw04365-A_000277-000837 uh well the last thing i had done was a a muffler [noise] put on my truck
sw04365-A_000949-001246 and then i usually do my own oil changes
sw04365-A_002400-002523 hm yeah
sw04365-A_002787-002871 [noise]
sw04365-A_002871-002974 oh yeah
sw04365-A_003303-003485 i live in Fort Worth Texas
sw04365-A_003671-003897 oh and uh
sw04365-A_004130-004840 i guess uh so do you do your own car repairs or do you take it to the garage to have it done
sw04365-A_005005-005121 yeah
sw04365-A_005443-005625 [laughter]
sw04365-A_005774-006964 oh yeah that's true i try to do most of my own to [noise] but nowadays a lot of these cars are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so [noise]
sw04365-A_007071-007166 yep
sw04365-A_008127-008237 we[ll]- yeah
sw04365-A_008393-008805 uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you
sw04365-A_008805-009196 and the only way to fix that is by taking it
sw04365-A_009196-009449 and having them analyze the computer
sw04365-A_009601-009929 because_1 we had the same problem [noise] on our car
sw04365-A_010064-010540 and uh they took it in and they found a problem with the computer itself
sw04365-A_010710-011033 because_1 it quit on my wife one time coming home from
sw04365-A_011121-011564 from a friends house it just quit on her died on her [laughter]
sw04365-A_011564-011772 [noise]
sw04365-A_011772-011923 [vocalized-noise]
sw04365-A_012071-012891 but other than that i usually like i said i try i do all the spark plugs changes wires and i do my own tune-ups and stuff
sw04365-A_012891-013011 uh
sw04365-A_013136-013907 other than the major stuff i usually take it to the car you know repair shop because_1 i don't have much time to do much anything else
sw04365-A_014399-014592 [noise] that's for sure
sw04365-A_014677-014784 uh
sw04365-A_014784-014909 what
sw04365-A_015034-015342 no i take it down to Midas and have them do it
sw04365-A_015342-015744 that way it's guaranteed if anything goes wrong with it they got to replace it
sw04365-A_015744-015894 [laughter]
sw04365-A_016095-016199 no
sw04365-A_016283-016820 it was uh pretty simple really they they did it in about a half hour you know and
sw04365-A_016820-017514 it would've cost me just as much for the whole thing because_1 it came with a an assembly
sw04365-A_017640-017821 uh it
sw04365-A_017821-018533 it uh unbolted just in front of the muffler and it went to the tail pipe and it was just all one piece
sw04365-A_018533-018811 and it would've cost me just as much to
sw04365-A_018923-019123 from the dealer just to get the
sw04365-A_019123-019632 the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it
sw04365-A_020015-020242 at the i got a Nissan pickup
sw04365-A_020421-021047 and the like i said the price of the assembly would've been more just about as much as
sw04365-A_021047-021284 having Midas do it so
sw04365-A_021284-021361 [laughter]
sw04365-A_021494-021871 it was just easy just to have them go ahead and do it real quick
sw04365-A_022681-022787 yeah
sw04365-A_022916-023497 last time i looked underneath it all i mean just rusted to pieces [laughter]
sw04365-A_023707-023834 oh yeah
sw04365-A_023919-024052 uh oh
sw04365-A_024215-024753 but i usually like i said i usually do a lot of my own work and uh
sw04365-A_024753-025260 the on[ly]- we've on[ly]- only had one like i said had one major problem with our car
sw04365-A_025260-025708 and i let them handle it at the car dealer since it was still under warranty
sw04365-A_026087-026200 so
sw04365-A_026308-026410 uh
sw04365-A_026505-026785 do you do all your own tune-ups and stuff
sw04365-A_027572-027689 oh yeah
sw04365-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04365-B_001439-001679 yeah my car needs uh
sw04365-B_001679-001825 an uh
sw04365-B_001825-002066 i think a muffler but um
sw04365-B_002134-002465 not sure because_1 i haven't looked at it yet it's just getting louder
sw04365-B_002545-002730 to live in New England
sw04365-B_002943-003038 yeah
sw04365-B_003194-003346 where do you live
sw04365-B_003464-003600 uh-huh
sw04365-B_004819-005059 i mostly do my own
sw04365-B_005059-005526 i i find it uh more satisfactory [laughter]
sw04365-B_005526-005802 and [laughter-i] like to save the money too
sw04365-B_006895-007112 yeah makes a lot harder
sw04365-B_007213-007515 i've got uh some hesitation problem
sw04365-B_007515-007671 that uh
sw04365-B_007671-008161 i haven't fi[gured]- figured out it's got fuel injection and it's all computerized so
sw04365-B_008237-008347 i don't know
sw04365-B_008754-008886 yeah
sw04365-B_009443-009577 um-hum
sw04365-B_009974-010090 hm
sw04365-B_011445-011572 oh
sw04365-B_013907-014038 yeah
sw04365-B_014149-014440 that's one thing finding the time to do it
sw04365-B_014810-015034 it did you do your muffler
sw04365-B_015719-016103 yeah that's that's not a fun job either
sw04365-B_017546-017670 hm
sw04365-B_019608-019745 hm
sw04365-B_019745-020021 what um what kind of vehicle
sw04365-B_020208-020333 uh-huh
sw04365-B_021871-021998 yeah
sw04365-B_021998-022460 yes a a lot of times the the bolts are all rusty and
sw04365-B_022460-022772 makes it hard to get it apart anyway but
sw04365-B_023307-023761 [laughter] well yeah [laughter] if you let go far enough it'll fall off
sw04365-B_025793-025914 um
sw04365-B_026087-026200 uh-huh
sw04365-B_026833-027064 yeah uh
sw04365-B_027165-027349 spark plugs
sw04365-B_027349-027627 the coolant changing the oil
sw04365-B_027741-027884 uh
sw04365-B_028046-028160 i
sw04365-B_028160-028289 see
sw04365-B_028447-028952 i had to do quite a few things when i when i bought this car used
sw04365-B_028952-029077 uh
sw04365-B_029178-029451 the alternator was loose uh
sw04365-B_029451-029657 had to fix that
sw04365-B_029758-029917 and they had the uh
sw04366-A_000000-000092 [noise]
sw04366-A_000877-001194 well i don't know my grandfather
sw04366-A_001194-001563 is ninety two years old
sw04366-A_001563-002160 and he is still living by himself my m[other]- grandmother died a couple of years ago
sw04366-A_002160-002811 but he doesn't want to to move away he lives in a [lil/little] farmhouse on a farm
sw04366-A_002811-003473 and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't wanna go to a nursing home
sw04366-A_003914-004507 well he was until this operation he has arthritis
sw04366-A_004507-004671 an[d]-
sw04366-A_004671-005360 now i don't really think he's doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him
sw04366-A_005360-005912 and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
sw04366-A_005912-006441 but um my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was
sw04366-A_006441-006662 a hundred and three
sw04366-A_006762-007243 an[d]- um died six weeks after they put him in the home
sw04366-A_008856-009017 um-hum
sw04366-A_011709-011854 um-hum
sw04366-A_015834-016388 but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
sw04366-A_018168-018340 um-hum
sw04366-A_022804-022962 um-hum
sw04366-A_024272-025061 bu[t]- i don't i mean at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that but i think a lot of nursing homes really
sw04366-A_025061-025383 um are guilty of neglect
sw04366-A_029035-029198 um-hum
sw04366-B_000000-000368 [noise] well Julie um are you in a situation where you'd
sw04366-B_000368-000600 soon need to deal with uh
sw04366-B_000600-000831 special care for elderly
sw04366-B_001471-001579 um-hum
sw04366-B_002032-002142 hm
sw04366-B_003477-003943 is he able to uh still d[o]- do everything himself pretty well
sw04366-B_004365-004521 oh yeah
sw04366-B_005801-005929 yeah
sw04366-B_006590-006718 um-hum
sw04366-B_007171-007876 yeah and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f[ather's]- grandfather's feelings because
sw04366-B_007876-008490 um i th[ink]- you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of
sw04366-B_008592-008895 do they still have some of their life left
sw04366-B_008895-010101 and and far as far a[s]- i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and i'm just here for the rest of the stay
sw04366-B_010101-010914 and so i you know [noise] i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home
sw04366-B_011084-012452 it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs ah they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
sw04366-B_012452-012560 um
sw04366-B_012560-012707 i know my
sw04366-B_012707-013223 none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally
sw04366-B_013223-013763 were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all
sw04366-B_013763-014473 goodness younger than your [laughter-grandparents] like they were in their eighties that type of thing um
sw04366-B_014602-014769 but i did uh
sw04366-B_014941-015744 you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do s[ome]- take care of themselves physically
sw04366-B_015744-015903 hum
sw04366-B_016428-016924 and that's that's difficult part because i think what they [ofend/often] get
sw04366-B_016924-017270 used as is uh
sw04366-B_017270-018244 [noise] almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
sw04366-B_018379-018525 um [noise]
sw04366-B_018525-018977 i know like here in Saskatchewan we have our
sw04366-B_018977-019821 hospital care well and the care actually for the e[lderly]- older people graded in level in four levels
sw04366-B_019821-020253 and a level four type of care would be someone that
sw04366-B_020253-021363 really requires long-term hospital care ah generally are not able to look after [thisselves/themselves] to very to a very great extent physically
sw04366-B_021363-022306 often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's disease or those [noise] or or physical and mental handicaps
sw04366-B_022306-022563 um you know where they really required
sw04366-B_022563-023114 twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal
sw04366-B_023114-023320 and uh
sw04366-B_023320-023601 but i think [noise] it can be helpful
sw04366-B_023601-024164 in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need
sw04366-B_024266-024353 um
sw04366-B_025420-026022 yeah i thi[nk]- and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
sw04366-B_026022-026227 i guess uh
sw04366-B_026334-026764 a broad social medical system where uh
sw04366-B_026764-027460 you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals
sw04366-B_027584-028812 and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the US um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is
sw04366-B_028812-029085 to the ability of the individual to pay
sw04366-B_029196-029872 and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely o[n]-
sw04367-A_000000-000128 [noise] now
sw04367-A_000128-000730 well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real
sw04367-A_000730-001588 i don't have a budget [laughter] uh what i basically am a do is i- i have a
sw04367-A_001588-002117 a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with [laughter]
sw04367-A_002117-002728 and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments
sw04367-A_002728-003842 so i'm real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want
sw04367-A_003842-004682 [laughter] or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and that's it
sw04367-A_004682-004819 [laughter]
sw04367-A_006447-007917 well the one thing i've always done is i've put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month
sw04367-A_008090-008307 right and
sw04367-A_008561-009191 right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh
sw04367-A_009191-010092 i knew i c[ould]- i would be able to do that and that uh y[ou]- you have to be uh responsible for your own
sw04367-A_010092-011554 uh [noise] retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i- i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i- said i- i know that i will always be able to afford this
sw04367-A_011554-011855 and i said that well you know if i
sw04367-A_011855-012429 if i start making a significant more amount of money i- i would put more into it
sw04367-A_012429-012694 and make a new budget but i've
sw04367-A_012694-014026 uh it's cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better [laughter] so i've actually probably making less money than i was when i started [laughter]
sw04367-A_014026-014711 so although i have not ch[anged]- i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less
sw04367-A_014813-014910 yeah
sw04367-A_015011-015126 right
sw04367-A_015439-015585 um-hum
sw04367-A_017059-017201 well that [noise]
sw04367-A_017846-018926 [laughter] well cer[tainly]- certainly your in a family situation you you'd expect a little bit more uh uh y[ou]- more structured and
sw04367-A_018926-019072 yeah
sw04367-A_019907-020612 [noise] right i just kind of consult [noise] with uh uh me myself and i you know [laughter]
sw04367-A_020612-020853 right [laughter]
sw04367-A_020853-021059 that's right [noise] uh
sw04367-A_021059-021797 so that ma[kes]- that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and i've always been fairly conscientious i've never really
sw04367-A_021797-022324 i- i don't buy anything really on a whim i do buy things
sw04367-A_022324-023616 that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state
sw04367-A_024154-024317 right
sw04367-A_024317-025490 right you know i- i- i don't just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it
sw04367-A_025490-025657 and then i buy it
sw04367-A_025657-025802 but i do
sw04367-A_027884-028077 um-hum
sw04367-A_028708-029786 right my i've always [laughter] you know that's what w[hat]- [noise] an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our
sw04367-B_000000-000198 [noise] okay
sw04367-B_002050-002213 uh-huh
sw04367-B_002690-002846 okay
sw04367-B_003898-004046 uh-huh
sw04367-B_004606-005541 right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments
sw04367-B_005541-006547 so you don't you don't then actually plan that this month i'm gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be
sw04367-B_007720-007868 uh-huh
sw04367-B_007868-008638 so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess that's sort of a budget then at least partial
sw04367-B_008762-008912 yeah
sw04367-B_010033-010170 um-hum
sw04367-B_010384-010493 right
sw04367-B_011136-011286 um-hum
sw04367-B_012317-012544 um-hum sure sure
sw04367-B_013395-013531 right
sw04367-B_013791-014067 um-hum okay_1
sw04367-B_014652-015830 right right sure well i think [laughter-that's] [laughter-true] [laughter-of] [laughter-all] [laughter-of] [laughter-us] the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan
sw04367-B_015830-017039 uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we don't spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one
sw04367-B_017039-017605 so i wouldn't just go out and buy a
sw04367-B_017605-018179 you know a i don't know a new computer [laughter] uh without
sw04367-B_018805-019996 well that's true that's true uh certainly when you're single you don't have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing
sw04367-B_020310-020950 uh-huh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay
sw04367-B_020950-021127 yeah i see
sw04367-B_021356-021489 uh-huh
sw04367-B_022151-022299 okay
sw04367-B_022749-022893 um-hum
sw04367-B_023109-023249 sure
sw04367-B_023490-024402 so you're careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy
sw04367-B_024649-024773 right
sw04367-B_025140-025262 right
sw04367-B_025409-025597 sure sure
sw04367-B_025597-026885 okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if we're going to get something you know whatever it may be and we're comfortable and have most the things we need or want the
sw04367-B_026885-027745 we'd you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned
sw04367-B_027745-028768 that that's what we were going to get we wouldn't just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if we'd planned to get the thing
sw04368-A_000000-000309 [noise] what do you do in terms of exercise if anything
sw04368-A_000760-000920 no i'm not
sw04368-A_002791-002903 wow
sw04368-A_002903-003039 [laughter]
sw04368-A_003244-003439 how many people play
sw04368-A_004002-004123 i [laughter-bet]
sw04368-A_004970-005096 [laughter]
sw04368-A_005872-006013 [laughter]
sw04368-A_006013-006108 well
sw04368-A_006108-006529 i take a an aerobics class three nights a week
sw04368-A_006529-007154 and it's at the fitness center i actually work for an electronics company but we have a a fitness center
sw04368-A_007154-007366 at there at the building
sw04368-A_007366-008419 and i take uh this aerobics class which is a great class it's what they call a circuit class where you do a few minutes of aerobic exercise and then you break and do some weight work
sw04368-A_008419-009234 with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to the elastic bands or whatnot but it's it's broken up for an hour
sw04368-A_009461-009851 no no this is low impact this is safe [laughter-stuff]
sw04368-A_010157-010920 i- i think it is um i took a a high low impact class at the local Y a couple of years ago
sw04368-A_010920-011630 and it just seemed like i was on the verge of getting hurt in terms of knees or back or something like that
sw04368-A_011630-011771 uh
sw04368-A_012851-013573 yeah well i think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that it's so jarring and you don't with the low impact you always have one foot on the floor
sw04368-A_013573-013912 you can get pretty strenuous [laughter-doing] [laughter-that] [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] [laughter-stuff]
sw04368-A_014506-015289 yeah well i think it has to do with number of feet on the floor and how much bouncing around you do and that sort of thing like the class i'm in now does not do jumping jacks
sw04368-A_015422-015583 but we
sw04368-A_015583-015941 right but but we certainly get our heart rates up
sw04368-A_015941-016357 just from the the marching and and all that that we do so
sw04368-A_016516-016686 yeah i think so
sw04368-A_016879-017329 it's it's at a fitness center that's associated with the company where i work yes
sw04368-A_017520-017800 uh no i have to pay to join
sw04368-A_017800-018166 uh but it runs oh i think the class is
sw04368-A_018166-018614 let's see i pay about ten dollars a month to be a member of this fitness
sw04368-A_018614-018750 center
sw04368-A_018750-019470 and and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in ter[m]- you know any anything from chess clubs to flying clubs [laughter] you think
sw04368-A_019470-020119 and uh then it's an extra forty dollars for an eight weeks aerobics class
sw04368-A_020119-020822 and i think it's pretty competitive with most health most health centers and they they have a swimming pool and a gym and all kinds of
sw04368-A_020822-021094 all kinds of the Nautilus equipment
sw04368-A_021366-021612 yes i- i did some of that
sw04368-A_021612-021946 but it the time it [laughter-takes] [laughter-is] [laughter-just]
sw04368-A_021946-022633 it uh i don't know once i- i get through with the aerobics session i'm ready to go home and eat [laughter-dinner] [laughter-or] [laughter-something]
sw04368-A_022848-022941 yes
sw04368-A_024655-024785 uh-huh
sw04368-A_025290-025444 [laughter]
sw04368-A_025844-025994 yeah w[ell]-
sw04368-A_026991-027284 well the advantage is sometimes i'm too tired to eat
sw04368-A_027284-027397 [laughter]
sw04368-A_027397-028051 now i mean they really offer classes in the mornings and there's even one class at noon
sw04368-A_028051-028821 but i can't really see breaking up the middle of the day going off and doing aerobics taking a shower [laughter-getting] [laughter-back] [laughter-to] [laughter-work]
sw04368-B_000000-000064 [noise]
sw04368-B_000264-000838 e[xercising]- exercising um i play w[ally]- uh wally ball are you familiar with that
sw04368-B_000838-001914 i belong to a club uh uh near where i live or uh actually where i work uh in Salem New Hampshire and they uh it's on a racquet ball court and you set up a net and you play wally ball
sw04368-B_001914-002844 it's just like volley ball but with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls to help put the ball over or that type of thing
sw04368-B_002844-003303 uh so it's it's kind of more fast paced than uh volley ball
sw04368-B_003420-003809 uh you can play up to uh four or five on each side
sw04368-B_003809-004089 which is quite a few people in such a small space
sw04368-B_004089-004391 um uh but we usually play two and two
sw04368-B_004391-005062 uh sometimes three uh three and three depending on how many people are willing to get up that early since we play before work
sw04368-B_005062-005667 uh so we play that a couple of times a week and then i also play pick up games of bask[etball]- basketball in the mornings as well
sw04368-B_005667-006004 so uh that's usually the [laughter-extent] of my exercise
sw04368-B_006004-006143 it's kind of crazy
sw04368-B_006485-006590 huh
sw04368-B_007297-007429 oh really
sw04368-B_008366-008510 yeah
sw04368-B_009160-009554 now are these is this what they call high impact or is this
sw04368-B_009802-009880 [laughter]
sw04368-B_009880-010188 now is the high impact really that dangerous for you
sw04368-B_011459-011654 wow
sw04368-B_011654-012260 that that's amazing i'd taken some dance courses in in uh school and i don't know it
sw04368-B_012260-012895 uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring
sw04368-B_013533-013675 oh okay [noise]
sw04368-B_013809-013910 [laughter]
sw04368-B_013910-014584 well see that's the thing i see some of these people doing low impact and i'm like what's the difference [laughter] these people are really working up a sweat
sw04368-B_014741-014905 right
sw04368-B_014905-015048 huh
sw04368-B_015304-015434 okay
sw04368-B_015434-015657 cause both feet can't be on the floor at one time
sw04368-B_015898-016003 huh
sw04368-B_016308-016627 which is i guess the whole point of it
sw04368-B_016627-016883 now the[y]- you say do this at work
sw04368-B_017276-017593 do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits
sw04368-B_017717-017860 oh okay
sw04368-B_018637-018749 huh
sw04368-B_019419-019554 [noise]
sw04368-B_020155-020252 huh
sw04368-B_020664-020843 oh yeah
sw04368-B_021048-021460 i was going to say do they have the free weights circuit and the Nautilus circuit and all those things
sw04368-B_021861-022011 exactly
sw04368-B_022503-022644 [laughter]
sw04368-B_022644-022926 so you so you exercise in the evenings
sw04368-B_022926-024109 that's interesting uh i- i don't know it my schedule i guess is more i get up at about uh five thirty and then i go and play wally ball from six thirty to say eight
sw04368-B_024109-024717 and then i uh shave and shower and do that stuff uh at the gym and then i'm at work at eight thirty
sw04368-B_024717-025003 so it's all kind of in the in the in the morning
sw04368-B_025003-025279 but by the end by mid afternoon i'm like ugh
sw04368-B_025279-025355 [laughter]
sw04368-B_025355-025925 or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in the morning getting to work
sw04368-B_025925-026576 so it it's interesting a different schedule um uh you don't feel more tired toward i guess well i guess you would
sw04368-B_026576-026986 uh going home for dinner and then you're uh and then you're uh i i'm sure zonked
sw04368-B_027258-027458 [laughter]
sw04368-B_028577-028731 yeah
sw04368-B_028731-029971 no i know some people who do that as well and i can't understand that either i mean you know i in the morning i come to uh uh work with uh wet hair and you know and kind of uh not breathless but just
sw04369-A_000000-000364 [noise] you're uh can you tell me what you think of capital punishment
sw04369-A_000563-000680 um-hum
sw04369-A_001420-001545 um-hum
sw04369-A_001691-001816 um-hum
sw04369-A_002744-002868 um-hum
sw04369-A_003254-003376 um-hum
sw04369-A_004682-005085 was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school
sw04369-A_005390-005889 there was something like something like that on Sixty Minutes about two years ago [noise]
sw04369-A_006623-006774 um-hum hm
sw04369-A_006774-006885 hm
sw04369-A_007556-007996 i don't find very many [laughter] that support mine
sw04369-A_007996-008533 well actually i mean not not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media um
sw04369-A_008533-009256 uh they ta[ke]- the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so
sw04369-A_009256-010705 uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception [laughter-i'm] [laughter-not] conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i- i lean against capital punishment but
sw04369-A_010705-012132 i- i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very th[at]- th[at]- that's that's quite unfortunate
sw04369-A_014012-014955 hm well that last caller actually i- i [laughter] this is the first time i've ever spoken about a topic for the second time but the last caller that i discussed it with didn't
sw04369-A_014955-015546 didn't say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often
sw04369-A_015546-016919 and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isn't it true that minorities you know from peo[ple]- in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldn't you expect them_1 to be [committed/convicted] to to be convicted more often [noise]
sw04369-A_016919-017599 now i do think i recall seeing some statistics to to the effect that that you that you mentioned um [noise]
sw04369-A_017599-018432 i don't know that you know maybe it was a r[eport]- a news report i heard or something where i couldn't check it out very carefully where i couldn't i i always tend to read over these things you know
sw04369-A_018432-019587 especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that
sw04369-A_019587-020402 and so i don't know whether i necessa[rily]- [laughter] whether i wanna give credence to that without looking into it but i do remember hearing that yeah
sw04369-A_020648-020767 um-hum
sw04369-A_020767-020875 um-hum
sw04369-A_021145-021257 um-hum
sw04369-A_021257-021888 [noise] yeah well i'm i mean i- i- i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable
sw04369-A_021888-022760 if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them_1 out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so
sw04369-A_022760-023828 so that's definitely a problem and um you know [noise] well [laughter] we're supposed to talk about our state i guess according to the synopsis at the beginning so North Carolina has capital punishment well [noise]
sw04369-A_023828-024562 if if North Carolina didn't have capital punishment i wouldn't try and institute it it it does have capital punishment i don't see that it does any good
sw04369-A_024562-025125 they might convict somebody wrongly sometime that's unfortunate but um [noise] you know fa[rther]-
sw04369-A_025125-026084 the fortunate thing really is th[at]- that it occurs so rarely uh i think we have about uh maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in North Carolina now i
sw04369-A_026084-026740 i know there're some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right
sw04369-A_027405-027545 um-hum
sw04369-A_027545-027674 hm
sw04369-A_028008-029227 yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments Wis[consin]- Wisconsin the same way
sw04369-A_029520-029671 hm
sw04369-A_029671-029799 um-hum
sw04369-B_000000-000116 [noise] yeah
sw04369-B_000309-000694 um i'm against capital punishment um
sw04369-B_000694-000941 i- i guess there's a cliche that
sw04369-B_000941-002421 um for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is uh killed that that's a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a a documentary film a couple of years ago
sw04369-B_002421-003530 i've forgotten the name of it now but it was about a killing in Texas where somebody was sentenced i think it may have been just to life imprisonment but in any event it may have been capital punishment but uh
sw04369-B_003530-004833 this documentari[an]- documentarian or whatever you wanna say um he uh interviewed all the parties involved and basically got another person to admit that he had been the one who had committed the murder i don't know [vocalized-noise]
sw04369-B_005011-005567 um no i don't think so it was a i don't remember the circumstances actually i- i just remember
sw04369-B_005712-006049 no no this was documentary um
sw04369-B_006049-007009 [noise] it was a a you know in released in theaters i saw it on PBS finally i guess um but any event it was it was very interesting and it
sw04369-B_007009-007718 you know i guess [laughter] they say that you look for views in the media that support your own and [laughter] maybe maybe that's the bias here
sw04369-B_007718-008128 [laughter] well what's your um perspective on capital punishment
sw04369-B_008391-008525 um-hum
sw04369-B_012005-012265 and there's also the factor that
sw04369-B_012265-013551 that there's obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also c[onvicted]- convicted of capital crimes
sw04369-B_013551-014209 and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher percentage than they're represented even among criminals so that's
sw04369-B_014647-014788 oh really
sw04369-B_016517-016647 um-hum
sw04369-B_018824-018954 um-hum
sw04369-B_018954-019119 right
sw04369-B_019119-019289 i think
sw04369-B_019516-019660 i don't know
sw04369-B_020223-021294 um-hum i think some bar associations um a lot of bar associations are against capital punishment and um this is one area where perhaps they've done some of the work i'm not sure
sw04369-B_023524-023658 right
sw04369-B_024505-024639 um-hum
sw04369-B_025968-026115 is that so
sw04369-B_026594-026781 i'm not sure i think
sw04369-B_026781-028107 [vocalized-noise] that sounds right offhand but i'm not positive i- i have only recently moved to Kentucky so i'm not even sure what Kentucky's law is my guess is it's probably legal but probably similar to Carolina that it's not used very frequently
sw04369-B_028440-028567 right
sw04369-B_028963-029100 right
sw04369-B_029100-029799 right i was living in Illinois before here and i'm virtually certain that they didn't have it or if they did have it it was never used
sw04370-A_000000-000157 [noise]
sw04370-A_000157-000899 actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime
sw04370-A_000899-001582 uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh
sw04370-A_001582-001965 uh finding of uh guilt
sw04370-A_002550-002708 [noise]
sw04370-A_003045-003751 yeah i think there's a limit on that the uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to i don't know how many but you can
sw04370-A_004968-005097 hm
sw04370-A_005097-005883 yeah i it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things i think i have a severe demeanor or something
sw04370-A_005883-006048 uh
sw04370-A_006157-006544 but typically you know basi[cally]- uh typically
sw04370-A_006544-007041 uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and
sw04370-A_007041-008275 i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice
sw04370-A_008522-008648 right
sw04370-A_008648-008790 so
sw04370-A_008975-009444 so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh
sw04370-A_009731-009855 hm
sw04370-A_011898-012053 um-hum
sw04370-A_012734-012869 hm
sw04370-A_014070-014277 um-hum um-hum
sw04370-A_015698-015822 hm
sw04370-A_016249-016393 um-hum
sw04370-A_016393-016564 hm
sw04370-A_016564-016712 um-hum
sw04370-A_017239-017508 well i suppose you may be right on that
sw04370-A_017700-017922 as a matter of fact i've heard that
sw04370-A_018042-019326 i've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
sw04370-A_022065-022354 oh is it oh i didn't realize that okay
sw04370-A_022925-023049 right
sw04370-A_023670-023801 um-hum
sw04370-A_024225-024343 um-hum
sw04370-A_024343-024863 so you['re]- what you're saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them_1
sw04370-A_025717-025878 um-hum
sw04370-A_028139-028704 what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets
sw04370-A_028928-029062 oh really
sw04370-A_029062-029194 like what
sw04370-A_029469-029531 hm
sw04370-B_000000-000094 [noise]
sw04370-B_001917-003067 hm i certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements uh and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because_1 they want to
sw04370-B_003313-003513 i think it's
sw04370-B_003625-004347 it's four or five i can't remember which i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out
sw04370-B_004347-004659 as uh the last selection
sw04370-B_004659-004912 that the uh defense got
sw04370-B_005869-006288 hm [laughter] that uh
sw04370-B_008124-008548 right but it still has to be a group of your peers
sw04370-B_008548-008681 see
sw04370-B_008681-009010 so if it's your peers and you're not educated
sw04370-B_009010-009202 then
sw04370-B_009202-009818 you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit
sw04370-B_009818-010710 as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them so that's why the defense is there
sw04370-B_010710-012013 picking through them_1 whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
sw04370-B_012013-012739 so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment
sw04370-B_012739-014073 afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty
sw04370-B_014073-015387 right and many times i've seen on trials they have on TV the jury -[w]ill make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers
sw04370-B_015387-015734 to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
sw04370-B_015734-016659 maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system
sw04370-B_016659-017272 uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
sw04370-B_017378-018089 as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure
sw04370-B_019206-020170 well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
sw04370-B_020170-021139 but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system
sw04370-B_021139-022187 then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
sw04370-B_022187-023027 at least in California they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background
sw04370-B_023027-023413 but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down
sw04370-B_023413-023738 i think that uh that they should
sw04370-B_023738-024294 i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring
sw04370-B_024846-025790 well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
sw04370-B_025790-026408 so you got to give them_1 either more time in the system or a different process that'll hopefully work better
sw04370-B_026596-026663 uh
sw04370-B_026663-027038 when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that
sw04370-B_027038-028264 for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things
sw04370-B_028646-029008 i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are
sw04370-B_029008-029147 yeah
sw04370-B_029147-029709 well uh say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street
sw04370-B_029709-029962 who comes up uh carrying a kni[fe]-

sw04371-A_008012-009180 they a[re]- e[very]- every the word is out that they are like the best truck uh especially like if you want to get like you know heavier than a mini pick up and uh they weren't cutting too many deals
sw04371-A_009180-009793 with uh with the prices on the F one fifties es[pecially]- especially like in the in the four wheel drive models
sw04371-A_009793-010684 but uh i- i- i guess like all these people can't be that wrong you know in terms uh of uh of how th[ey]- how they are

sw04372-A_004729-006135 uh really i- i- i don't think that's a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um s[ome]- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local KMart or or [noise] um
sw04372-A_006135-006479 Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but
sw04372-A_006479-007737 th[en]- th[en]- then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
sw04372-A_008945-009088 yes
sw04372-A_011561-011942 i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but
sw04372-A_011942-012272 i[s]- b[ut]- is it also legal
sw04372-A_012272-013556 for you to do that w[hat]- w[hat]- fr[om]- from what i understand from v[arious]- v[arious]- various net readings i[t]- i[t]- it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state
sw04372-A_013556-014908 tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c[an]- can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that w[ill]- do your arguments still apply
sw04372-A_017351-017663 which is exactly what businesses do at the present
sw04372-A_018733-018902 and i- i
sw04372-A_018902-019512 i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it
sw04372-A_019625-020482 that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
sw04372-A_020482-021058 and there r[easons]- there are s[ome]- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that
sw04372-A_021538-021760 a as if
sw04372-A_021760-022056 no businesses um if
sw04372-A_022056-023043 purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um
sw04372-A_023043-023746 i- i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my a[partment]- accounting department will at the end of the month
sw04372-A_023864-024448 uh i think that [noise] i think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC
sw04372-A_024866-025001 yeah
sw04372-A_027297-028672 that's true i[s]- i[s]- a r[eal]- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i- i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a [noise] a a loss i- i think
sw04372-A_028672-029847 is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism jus[t]- just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i- i don't know if i agree with that but it b[ut]-
sw04372-B_000000-000874 [noise] so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
sw04372-B_000874-001953 and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it
sw04372-B_001953-002285 what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there
sw04372-B_003669-004726 what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order
sw04372-B_007736-007979 well i mean it seems to me that
sw04372-B_007979-008829 generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because
sw04372-B_008829-010001 i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh it's because i- i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that
sw04372-B_010001-010727 and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed
sw04372-B_010727-011574 even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
sw04372-B_014832-016168 well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
sw04372-B_016168-017436 then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania
sw04372-B_017600-019005 right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
sw04372-B_019463-019594 ah
sw04372-B_020991-021899 uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
sw04372-B_021899-022106 or purchasing
sw04372-B_024406-024934 yeah see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business
sw04372-B_024934-025380 so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
sw04372-B_025498-026472 um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that
sw04372-B_026472-027223 um the opportunity f[or]- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
sw04373-A_000000-000013 [noise]
sw04373-A_000013-000614 been about ten years since i graduated from high school i got a GED i was a drop out up until that point
sw04373-A_000614-001179 and uh as my memory serves me school was not that um
sw04373-A_001179-002507 didn't achieve it's goals as being an educational institution very well and i would suppose that the trend in government is for things to get worse kind of like uh chaos and regular deterioration so i don't not having seen anything to
sw04373-A_002507-002819 change my mind i would assume it's gotten worse in the meantime
sw04373-A_003827-003954 yeah
sw04373-A_004426-004942 yeah i had really reached the point where i'd quit going entirely i was tired of it was off working somewhere
sw04373-A_004942-005196 there was almost no challenge to it at all
sw04373-A_005196-005315 uh
sw04373-A_005528-005655 um
sw04373-A_005939-006628 yeah i had started in that uh that track but just got sick of it and turned into a juvenile delinquent instead
sw04373-A_006628-007536 went off and joined the military and then uh came back to college it just the material was so repetitive it was stuff we already seen probably half a
sw04373-A_007536-008820 who knows how many times before and it was just presented so dryly and i suppose that if um if you're going to pay teachers the salary that they're paid that's that's the level of education that's going to be presented
sw04373-A_009275-009423 yeah
sw04373-A_010273-010420 um
sw04373-A_010688-010858 yeah absolutely
sw04373-A_010858-011066 it's a stress test [laughter]
sw04373-A_011066-011231 [laughter]
sw04373-A_011864-012003 um
sw04373-A_012659-012768 yeah
sw04373-A_012768-013968 yeah i agree it's a whole another class of everything the level of education the uh excitement and the the interesting instructors their level of understanding the material everything's different
sw04373-A_014547-014774 now how would you recommend doing that
sw04373-A_015286-015393 yeah
sw04373-A_016135-016527 sounds a lot like the um what do they call let's see uh
sw04373-A_016527-016950 fire fox Foxfire method
sw04373-A_016950-017628 that's the one where uh some guy it's here in Georgia north Georgia several years ago ten twenty years ago
sw04373-A_017628-018423 walked into a class room and they the students retained command and he just kind of threw up his hands and said basically do what you want to do
sw04373-A_018423-018863 and developed this uh program where the students pretty much did what they wanted to do
sw04373-A_018863-019562 the teacher was just there to kindly loosely kind of loosely guide them um along and to make sure that they weren't getting
sw04373-A_019562-020571 getting off into weird senseless subject areas and stuff like that and i think there was some kind of sociology class along the lines of um [noise]
sw04373-A_020571-021399 what did they do they went out and collected stories and culture of the area in southern Appalachian uh mountains
sw04373-A_021399-022606 and published a bunch of books and the guy's real famous now and in fact i just read recently that some school here in north Georgia decided to completely um adopt the Foxfire method all the classes are that way
sw04373-A_022606-023456 and they say that the results are just tremendous it's a whole another um magnitude of improvement over regular public schools
sw04373-A_023642-023989 yeah i wish there had been something like that years ago when we were younger
sw04373-A_024120-024211 [noise]
sw04373-A_024211-024508 yeah they've made a an amazing change
sw04373-A_025413-026247 a friend here in town just recently helped a um third grader with his science fair project [noise] and he was describing some of the interaction
sw04373-A_026247-026893 uh between the the teachers there and the students and the teachers there and himself and other people like him
sw04373-A_026893-027244 and was really disturbed with the uh
sw04373-A_027244-027893 mentality of the people there they treated him like uh he was one of the kids you know they had their little domain
sw04373-A_027893-028657 i remember he brought up a story about how he needed a desk to set up the [noise] uh the science fair project that he and this other guy worked on
sw04373-A_028657-029334 and they couldn't find one anywhere and they found one in a room and the instructor there was really possessive of it and wouldn't let him use it
sw04373-A_029464-029589 [noise] yeah
sw04373-B_000000-000062 [noise]
sw04373-B_000395-000454 [vocalized-noise]
sw04373-B_000568-000658 uh-huh
sw04373-B_002809-003656 yeah i graduated about the same time you did and um i graduated early only and i was lucky because i don't think i would have graduated at all
sw04373-B_003656-003896 [vocalized-noise] i was skipping and everything
sw04373-B_003896-004349 up to that point and i just happened to have enough credit hours so i could get out
sw04373-B_004908-005020 um-hum
sw04373-B_005164-005571 i was on the college track doing all the classes and i was done
sw04373-B_005571-005747 it was boring
sw04373-B_005747-005940 they weren't interested
sw04373-B_006584-006688 um-hum
sw04373-B_008783-009366 that's true we have to pay our teachers more and give them more incentive to interest the children
sw04373-B_009366-010364 um yeah i really i really believe the same thing i mean here i am now just now [noise] finishing up college it took me that long to get interested to go back
sw04373-B_010364-010762 you know and but i find college a whole different ball game
sw04373-B_011060-011362 it is but it's so stimulating i mean
sw04373-B_011362-011922 those teachers really are at least mine of course i'm in nursing so [laughter]
sw04373-B_011922-012053 [laughter]
sw04373-B_012053-012295 ours is a lot of life threatening but um
sw04373-B_012414-012725 i it it isn't i- i don't miss classes i love it
sw04373-B_013921-014135 maybe we ought to um
sw04373-B_014135-014538 offer this kind of enrichment to our high school students
sw04373-B_014722-014842 well
sw04373-B_014842-015177 if somehow we could make give them a certain amount of independence
sw04373-B_015177-015347 cause that's part of college
sw04373-B_015347-016036 right um and then simply say this is up to you to achieve this
sw04373-B_016842-017030 i haven't heard about that
sw04373-B_019256-019385 um-hum
sw04373-B_019961-020089 um-hum
sw04373-B_021083-021189 um-hum
sw04373-B_022498-022692 oh really
sw04373-B_023231-023300 [vocalized-noise]
sw04373-B_023425-023632 see and that and it works
sw04373-B_023962-024120 me too i wish they had computers
sw04373-B_024120-024165 [noise]
sw04373-B_024466-025197 i think i think elementary school is educa[tional]- is stimulating for children and i think we lose them somewhere
sw04373-B_025197-025448 between junior high and high school
sw04373-B_025935-026056 um-hum
sw04373-B_026839-026946 um-hum
sw04373-B_027856-028003 um
sw04373-B_029349-029524 oh you're kidding
sw04373-B_029524-029847 well then that goes to maybe not having the funds for things
sw04374-A_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04374-A_000061-000298 okay what do you do
sw04374-A_001113-001243 um-hum
sw04374-A_001512-001630 um-hum
sw04374-A_002489-002613 um-hum
sw04374-A_002829-002955 right
sw04374-A_003058-003854 well when when i was married my husband budgeted you know very very tightly
sw04374-A_003854-004684 but then every time there was any uh and he made sure of it if there was any extra money for anything he spent it
sw04374-A_004684-005557 right so you know that that type of budget i didn't func[tion]- you know i didn't uh i felt like i was getting the short end of the stick
sw04374-A_005557-006330 you know so uh but i'm i'm divorced now so i don't even have a bank account
sw04374-A_006330-007386 i have a my the company that i'm working for has a credit union and i put in the credit union every week
sw04374-A_007386-007675 a substantial amount of my check
sw04374-A_007675-008660 and then when i have some extra monthly uh or quarterly bills like insurances and taxes and things like that
sw04374-A_008660-009103 then i draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses
sw04374-A_009103-009963 and uh i you know i'm still very uh very tight with my money course i make very little also
sw04374-A_009963-010700 but i couldn't i just couldn't stand the pressure of having a checking account and being concerned about having a check that wasn't covered
sw04374-A_010700-011953 because they're really expensive down here on a you know if you if you misfigure your check you on a ten or twenty dollar check any any size check it could cost you easy fifty dollars to get it
sw04374-A_011953-012144 straightened out
sw04374-A_012144-012532 so and my my budget doesn't ha[ve]- stand for that
sw04374-A_012532-013442 so uh but i've i save uh uh i haven't the last two years i have saved in an IRA every year
sw04374-A_013442-013975 uh saved enough money to to buy an IR[A]- you know to pay for a two thousand dollar IRA every year
sw04374-A_013975-014791 and um i'm in the credit union uh not the credit union the company uh savings and investment plan
sw04374-A_014791-015411 and i save six percent there i actually sa[ve]- nine percent there they add three percent to it
sw04374-A_015411-015760 so uh i'm you know i'm uh
sw04374-A_015760-016685 well i'm i'm saving you know i e[ven]- even though i make very little money and and uh you know and me an[d]- it's it's me and my daughter
sw04374-A_016685-017639 and uh so uh you know i'm doing better [laughter-n[ow]-] better i'm came out of of a job that paid very well
sw04374-A_017639-018760 like for down here i made twenty five to thirty thousand a year and my ex made uh under forty
sw04374-A_018760-019444 and now the first year i was out on my own i made four i made twelve thousand
sw04374-A_019444-019757 yes it was tough
sw04374-A_019757-020498 and last year i got a promotion and a raise and and a better [vocalized-noise] different a better job and i made seventeen
sw04374-A_020498-021138 so uh i'm doing better uh and but i'm still saving more money now than i did when i was married
sw04374-A_022057-022766 they do here they you know a lot of people i mean they are and every time they have uh like a car break down
sw04374-A_022766-023816 or their taxes come due or [vocalized-noise] all kinds of stuff they would our credit [vocalized-noise] the credit union at the company that i work for was was more like a loan shark
sw04374-A_023816-024362 it was awful they w[ouldn't]- they didn't have to follow uh regulations of any kind
sw04374-A_024362-025518 and so the people would would every time they had trouble they didn't have to manage their money they'd just have to go sign their life away and and get money from the credit union
sw04374-A_025518-026123 and they just they ended up a lot of them ended up owing more at the credit union than they could then they could ever pay
sw04374-A_026123-026416 and they wouldn't get very much of a paycheck at all
sw04374-A_026416-027044 because of the credit union taking so much out and and they didn't weren't willing to manage their their checks
sw04374-A_027044-027896 you know and uh but i it was pitiful i mean you think good grief y'all what is your you know why but uh
sw04374-A_028602-028753 um-hum
sw04374-A_028753-028966 well if you
sw04374-A_028966-029939 exactly you know if you are not willing to budget your money then y[ou]- uh you know if you're not willing to be careful and live on what you make
sw04374-B_000000-000092 [noise] okay_1
sw04374-B_000272-000753 we use a monthly budget um my husband and i my husband works
sw04374-B_000753-001567 i don't and um he brings home the paycheck [laughter] and we have a budget or a balance sheet is what we call it
sw04374-B_001567-002073 we have different columns for different areas of our budget and
sw04374-B_002073-002557 we budget out a certain amount for each month or each pay period
sw04374-B_002557-002889 and then we try not to go over that [laughter]
sw04374-B_002889-003190 and so anyway what do you do
sw04374-B_003796-003943 uh-huh
sw04374-B_004624-004904 oh [laughter]
sw04374-B_005481-005740 right um-hum

sw04374-B_023907-024051 uh-huh
sw04374-B_024292-024451 oh uh-huh
sw04374-B_025304-025449 hm
sw04374-B_025449-025586 yeah
sw04374-B_026053-026200 right
sw04374-B_026349-026496 uh-huh
sw04374-B_026676-026802 uh-huh
sw04374-B_026969-027329 [laughter]
sw04374-B_027329-027475 yes
sw04374-B_027679-027824 uh-huh
sw04374-B_027824-028649 well i wasn't brought up this way to budget that's for sure my husband was and and it was really an adjustment period for me
sw04374-B_028649-029050 to learn how [laughter] but i could see the wisdom in it
sw04375-A_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04375-A_000019-000155 do you have a pet
sw04375-A_000350-000515 i have uh
sw04375-A_000515-000727 see three canaries
sw04375-A_001552-002361 oh we put uh vitamins in the water and uh we don't take really great care of them but uh we just make sure that their
sw04375-A_002361-002620 their water has vitamins in it and uh
sw04375-A_002620-002766 [noise]
sw04375-A_002766-003337 and some of them are hardier than others the ones that are really hearty are the ones that are that are uh
sw04375-A_003437-003965 how shall i say it variegated ones the the real brightly colored ones don't seem to be too hardy
sw04375-A_003965-004276 because_1 they've been bred for looks and not for strength
sw04375-A_004429-004681 so what kind of a dog do you have
sw04375-A_004950-005364 [laughter]
sw04375-A_006268-006392 uh-huh
sw04375-A_006846-007112 well the i think the important thing uh
sw04375-A_007112-007318 we've had several dogs and
sw04375-A_007318-007421 and uh
sw04375-A_007592-008043 my wife keeps going for these beautiful you know how shall i say it
sw04375-A_008148-008664 the beautiful dog is the one that catches her eye and so i keep telling her that beauty is not uh
sw04375-A_008664-009012 is not important when you've got a dog intelligence is
sw04375-A_009145-009646 now there's nothing worse than a dumb dog and this you know just like a dumb friend so to speak
sw04375-A_009955-010197 uh as far as the pets
sw04375-A_010197-010740 um she likes the fluffy ones and the ones that are you know that are how shall i say it
sw04375-A_010740-011104 they're really good looking but i like mutts myself
sw04375-A_012092-012818 yeah and and well like i say they're they're picked f[or]- they're bred for looks and so they're like these turkeys that you see in the in the uh
sw04375-A_012818-013335 i don't know if you've heard stories about the differences between wild turkeys and and uh [noise]
sw04375-A_013335-013971 and the ones that are bred for the meat but the ones that are bred for the meat will drown in a rain storm and because_1 they're so dumb and
sw04375-A_013971-014238 and uh they [vocalized-noise]
sw04375-A_014238-015149 uh wild turkeys are really smart and the thing that uh when it comes to pets is a a smart pet is really a lot of fun
sw04375-A_015149-016225 they that's been my experience but uh you don't get them by getting them for their looks you got to get them_1 for their you know how where they look at you with bright eyes when they're little puppies and stuff like that
sw04375-A_018545-019749 i- i feel the same thing pets are uh they add a new dimension they they give you something to think about when you're kind of tired or blue or something like that and uh they get you to think about something other than yourself
sw04375-A_019872-020081 and they never talk back almost
sw04375-A_020081-020231 [laughter]
sw04375-A_020432-020884 yeah and they uh and their it's kind of fun to rub them_1 and
sw04375-A_020884-021331 and uh well with canaries you don't do much of that but when they sing why it cheers you up
sw04375-A_021484-021642 so uh
sw04375-A_021642-022106 and i think that that uh they also give you a sense of of
sw04375-A_022106-022603 somebody is depending on you you've got to do something for them or or they uh
sw04375-A_022603-022755 they suffer
sw04375-A_022755-023241 so it adds a dimension that that uh you're kind of in control and that's
sw04375-A_023241-023454 kind of sad when people neglect pets but
sw04375-A_023580-023823 so let's see h[ow]- how old is your dog
sw04375-A_024434-024560 got to wait
sw04375-A_024560-024837 [laughter]
sw04375-A_024837-025209 w[ell]- have you uh let's see what else have you had other pets beside this
sw04375-A_025581-025916 they're the ones with the high pitched bark or
sw04375-A_025916-026041 yeah
sw04375-A_026041-026230 [laughter-yeah]
sw04375-B_000000-000063 [noise]
sw04375-B_000063-000369 yes i do i have a dog do you have pet
sw04375-B_000699-001499 oh i have never been fortunate enough to have a canary well let me rephrase that i've had them but i don't have luck with them_1 is there a secret
sw04375-B_004224-004446 oh really i didn't know that
sw04375-B_004624-005095 i have a mutt he's part pit and part boxer [laughter]
sw04375-B_005095-005281 but he is a
sw04375-B_005281-005986 very good dog he's very which surprised me because_1 i've had such um
sw04375-B_005986-006371 repercussions about having a part Pit
sw04375-B_006371-006788 especially around children but he's really good i can't complain
sw04375-B_008564-008799 [laughter]
sw04375-B_008992-009158 that's true
sw04375-B_009609-009940 just sh[e]- what does she like in par[ticular]- anything particular
sw04375-B_010083-010205 uh-huh
sw04375-B_011062-011405 they tend to take a lot of time
sw04375-B_011405-011667 whenever you get those kinds you have to
sw04375-B_011667-012101 brush them continually and that type of thing
sw04375-B_013894-014197 [laughter]
sw04375-B_015934-016016 [vocalized-noise]
sw04375-B_016016-016184 that's true
sw04375-B_016184-016505 do you think pets are uh
sw04375-B_016505-017183 handicapped or are they uh very worthwhile having them around and what is their use
sw04375-B_017183-018262 that was one of the questions i was told to um ask from the operator and i think that they're very useful especially for uh companionship
sw04375-B_018262-018536 and that type of thing what is your opinion
sw04375-B_019759-019894 that's true
sw04375-B_020107-020195 [laughter]
sw04375-B_020195-020417 and they're always there when you need them
sw04375-B_021303-021452 yes
sw04375-B_022680-022847 that's true
sw04375-B_023821-024430 oh he's young he's only a he he just turned a year so he's really um
sw04375-B_024430-024650 just starting out in the world
sw04375-B_025102-025634 yes i've had basenjies also i use to and they've um
sw04375-B_025816-026727 they don't bark at all they have a yodel and uh i haven't found any in this area anybody in this area that raises them to uh get another one
sw04375-B_026727-027925 so that's how we and we came across this one that we've had quite by accident my daughter found a had a family that wasn't taking care of it and just didn't want it and in the meantime we were looking for a basenji and uh
sw04375-B_027925-028654 we weren't very successful but uh they're an intelligent dog and they're very uh
sw04375-B_028654-028865 [noise] um
sw04375-B_029142-029939 independent but they're not so much independent that they uh are like a cat p[eople]- a lot of people
sw04376-A_000000-000093 [noise] your turn
sw04376-A_000881-001067 but not for petty theft
sw04376-A_002050-002161 [noise]
sw04376-A_002161-002474 [noise] well it should be used as a deterrent do you think
sw04376-A_002596-003199 or should it be used uh a[s]- to prevent further uh crime li[ke]-
sw04376-A_003334-003444 hm
sw04376-A_004251-004394 um-hum
sw04376-A_005175-006168 well you know there's this old um Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth [noise]
sw04376-A_007293-008624 uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value
sw04376-A_008624-009078 so if you have someone that that destroys that value
sw04376-A_009078-009847 uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss of course you have to also put value on the criminal
sw04376-A_009847-010195 so if you terminate him that's a loss of value
sw04376-A_010195-010536 so you know if you weight everyone equally
sw04376-A_010536-012019 then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him i[f]- if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person
sw04376-A_012149-012449 uh in order to justify taking his life
sw04376-A_012449-013139 another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people
sw04376-A_013139-013423 uh which is pretty uh
sw04376-A_013423-013851 delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income
sw04376-A_013851-014587 so [laughter] if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then
sw04376-A_014587-015571 then he's obviously not worth very much and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is um
sw04376-A_015571-016267 integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of
sw04376-A_016267-016688 [noise] who knows eight hundred thousand dollars
sw04376-A_016688-017554 uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the ex[pected]- expected remainder of his life is um
sw04376-A_017554-018841 small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh
sw04376-A_018841-019920 uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less
sw04376-A_019920-020492 which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
sw04376-A_020896-021099 um-hum
sw04376-A_021357-022078 now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophically but if you're involved yourself personally
sw04376-A_022078-022368 uh i know i have a friend whose
sw04376-A_022368-022666 uh son was murdered
sw04376-A_022666-023025 o[n]- on the night before his sixteenth birthday
sw04376-A_023132-023869 and let me tell you uh i- i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh
sw04376-A_024019-024643 you're talking about real trauma i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies
sw04376-A_024777-025061 uh the father you know o[f]- of course
sw04376-A_025061-026011 um a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact
sw04376-A_026011-026170 um
sw04376-A_026170-026292 [noise]
sw04376-A_026292-026407 and
sw04376-A_026407-026987 oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder
sw04376-A_027089-028091 uh well actually he i['m]- i'm sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but
sw04376-B_000000-000065 [noise]
sw04376-B_000065-000369 okay uh i don't think they should abolish it
sw04376-B_000369-000896 [laughter] i think it's i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got
sw04376-B_001005-001349 right no no for major things like
sw04376-B_001349-002041 premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing i don't think it should just be used
sw04376-B_002041-002202 loosely
sw04376-B_002202-002299 yeah
sw04376-B_002502-002594 well
sw04376-B_002968-004295 yes ye[ah]- prevent these people from ever getting out on the streets by you know some technicality and they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and they're on the streets again doing the same they they did before
sw04376-B_004295-005389 and you know you know that's about the only thing and like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know i don't think they should do tha[t]-
sw04376-B_005851-006319 oh we[ll]- well i guess if i if it was someone in my family i'd probably feel that way
sw04376-B_006319-007330 you know i've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered and so i really wouldn't know but but i feel like if i did i probably would feel that way
sw04376-B_009022-009150 um-hum
sw04376-B_009830-009929 right
sw04376-B_010200-010302 well that's true
sw04376-B_011967-012099 besides him
sw04376-B_012401-012518 okay
sw04376-B_014219-014381 [laughter]
sw04376-B_014381-014898 his life isn't worth very much then [laughter]
sw04376-B_019749-019907 right
sw04376-B_020530-020665 potential
sw04376-B_020665-020973 i mean that's th[e]- that's the key right there potential
sw04376-B_020973-021349 now are they are they rehabilitative or or not
sw04376-B_021349-021439 huh
sw04376-B_021951-022058 um-hum
sw04376-B_023446-023635 um-hum
sw04376-B_024607-024793 i can imagine
sw04376-B_025906-026076 yes yeah
sw04376-B_026262-026497 was he mur[dered]- did they find ou[t]- who killed him
sw04376-B_026497-026600 hm
sw04376-B_026921-027203 so it hasn't been a long time ago just recently
sw04376-B_027953-028101 [laughter]
sw04376-B_028101-028229 yeah
sw04376-B_028229-028612 yeah that appeals process i mean it's what you know really
sw04376-B_028612-029019 you know just drags out and out and out my brother-in-law here in Texas
sw04376-B_029019-029303 his by marriage my sister's hu[sband]- husband
sw04376-B_029303-029860 his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in Houston
sw04376-B_029860-030016 and uh he wou[ld]-
sw04377-A_000000-000077 [noise]
sw04377-A_000077-000229 shall um
sw04377-A_000229-000654 act[ually]- actually i've had i've had very good luck on consumer products lately
sw04377-A_000654-000807 um
sw04377-A_000807-001089 you know just about [vocalized-noise] i've i've uh
sw04377-A_001089-001535 gotten recently it's been a new mother board for my computer and that's working fine
sw04377-A_001535-001636 [noise]
sw04377-A_001636-001739 yeah
sw04377-A_001739-002120 because_1 my my other one bit the dust af[ter]- after a power failure
sw04377-A_002222-002913 so i- i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in California very happy we were very fast
sw04377-A_002913-003336 oth[er]- other than i'm i'm in house conservation [vocalized-noise] buying anything
sw04377-A_003440-003560 how about you
sw04377-A_004488-005089 yeah i- i hear you there the i- i guess you know given a choice most people are kind of holding off on
sw04377-A_005089-005788 getting anything um i'm trying to think back in mind if there's ever been any[thing]- anything i got
sw04377-A_005788-006369 you know the the things i've been most disappointed with is that when you go those time share gimmicks
sw04377-A_006369-007205 [vocalized-noise] and and you get you get like the the quality luggage which is like yes you too can have vinyl [vocalized-noise] you know wallet [vocalized-noise]
sw04377-A_007205-007313 um
sw04377-A_007553-007669 [vocalized-noise]
sw04377-A_007789-008226 right you know i- i find there's that you just have to be really careful
sw04377-A_008226-009333 because like especially if you watch TV there's like all such of scams going on where you know like uh you you really have to listen to what they're selling you i mean there's a lot of things like um
sw04377-A_009333-010097 God you you like you know yes you can get whole sacks of beef you know delivered fresh to you if you buy our thousand dollar refrigerator
sw04377-A_010097-010261 or um
sw04377-A_010261-010583 you know all all these multilevel marketing things
sw04377-A_010989-011268 [vocalized-noise] they they're tying them in now
sw04377-A_011769-011902 right
sw04377-A_012144-012251 [laughter-right]
sw04377-A_012615-013780 [vocalized-noise] like you know we've i'm getting married this summer and we're going to like wedding expos and things to get fashion and half the thing's like yes we'll give you a free makeover [vocalized-noise] we're Mary Kay cosmetics and

sw04377-A_014352-014654 or or you you know or all these little [vocalized-noise]
sw04377-A_014654-014995 i really think multilevel marketing is undermining
sw04377-A_014995-015630 the qu[ality]- quality of American business because people getting so focused on the progress other than the products
sw04377-A_015630-016275 you know it's it's like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and i'll be rich but
sw04377-A_016414-016602 yeah that's what multilevel [vocalized-noise]
sw04377-A_016602-017207 you know Amway and uh Al Williams insurance which i guess is Primerica now
sw04377-A_017502-017682 Mary Kay you know they they're something
sw04377-A_017783-018180 yeah oh d[o]- oh we we have Dallas to blame for Mary Kay
sw04377-A_018461-018572 [vocalized-noise]
sw04377-A_018572-019545 but yeah i- i- i find that you know the place where uh i- i think the the the o[ne]- one place were we uh you know consumer price i did fairly well i was leading electronics industry
sw04377-A_019992-020119 um-hum
sw04377-A_020350-020444 yeah
sw04377-A_021491-021730 too expensive in my opinion but

sw04378-A_009897-010767 and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
sw04378-A_010767-012166 some of the the wa[ter]- a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish
sw04378-A_012166-012689 but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay

sw04379-B_001134-001420 and we have
sw04379-B_001420-002144 you know we have money that we take out each month that we um you know for food and and for
sw04379-B_002144-003003 for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for um other things
sw04379-B_003003-003931 then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our n[eeds]- our needs and wants list
sw04379-B_003931-004829 and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want
sw04379-B_004829-005818 and um and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
sw04379-B_005818-006320 so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for

sw04379-B_010051-010178 right
sw04379-B_010178-011014 um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things
sw04379-B_011014-011451 if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here
sw04379-B_011451-012350 and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for Christmas
sw04379-B_012596-013425 [vocalized-noise] well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
sw04379-B_013425-014148 and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the [kidzees/kids] education that money goes into there
sw04379-B_014148-014512 each of our ch[ildren]- we have three children so they each have their own account
sw04379-B_014512-014756 that money is put into each month
sw04379-B_015396-015557 he does somewhat
sw04379-B_015557-015730 yeah he does somewhat
sw04379-B_015730-016145 um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does
sw04379-B_016145-016795 but um we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money
sw04379-B_017636-018783 Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um
sw04379-B_018783-019565 and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from
sw04379-B_019565-019674 we have it
sw04379-B_019674-020640 you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
sw04379-B_020640-021096 everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
sw04379-B_021096-021302 yeah [laughter]
sw04379-B_021873-022124 i do uh-huh all the money

sw04379-B_022752-023836 [noise] i have a set amount it's very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over
sw04379-B_023836-024943 um you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home
sw04379-B_024943-025688 and so it's kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing
sw04379-B_025688-026662 we have a clothing um envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing
sw04379-B_026662-027306 [noise] it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're
sw04379-B_028105-029544 yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year and also we need a new bed and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll have enough saved to go buy those
sw04379-B_029544-030039 [noise] and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards the
sw04380-A_000000-000332 [noise] recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know
sw04380-A_000332-000752 three or four years ago i'm a senior in in uh college now and uh
sw04380-A_000752-001564 i can't really talk too much [laughter-about] the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system i went to was
sw04380-A_001564-002101 uh really superb even though it was a public school system
sw04380-A_002266-002378 oh okay
sw04380-A_002488-002592 yeah
sw04380-A_002592-003063 i got a friend who goes there by the way [laughter-i] [laughter-wanted] to as[k]- talk to you about that afterward okay
sw04380-A_005031-005159 yeah
sw04380-A_005159-005871 yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system yes that's that was true for mine too um
sw04380-A_005871-006832 although i [noise] i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it
sw04380-A_006832-007652 you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education and uh
sw04380-A_007652-008263 you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04380-A_009703-010439 yeah that's true but [noise] but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school
sw04380-A_010439-011414 you should still be able to read [laughter-you] [laughter-know] which it s[ounds]- i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it jus[t]- started changing in the past few years because uh
sw04380-A_011414-012046 they have more of these um sort of mandatory -[manda]tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma but uh
sw04380-A_012046-013076 but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read um and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really
sw04380-A_013076-013424 i- i- i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen
sw04380-A_013424-014145 you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something but these people [laughter-obviously] weren't
sw04380-A_014311-014381 [noise]
sw04380-A_015137-015310 yeah
sw04380-A_015310-015466 yeah
sw04380-A_015882-016011 yeah
sw04380-A_016694-017314 yeah i mean i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i don't i think
sw04380-A_017314-017534 you know if people just
sw04380-A_018068-018746 yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting
sw04380-A_018746-019189 to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school
sw04380-A_019189-020051 uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
sw04380-A_020051-020515 i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i haven't done that
sw04380-A_020753-020883 [noise]
sw04380-A_020883-021644 but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think it's a good thing
sw04380-A_022799-022922 yeah
sw04380-A_023792-023909 yeah
sw04380-A_024075-024914 yeah yeah i mean i do[n't]- i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in you know i mean it's
sw04380-A_025903-026019 yeah
sw04380-A_027047-027323 [noise] yeah i mean and in the
sw04380-A_027323-028420 once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels
sw04380-A_028420-029363 y[ou]- well no i guess it wa[s]- in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects
sw04380-A_029363-029962 uh which i mean actually i think that works pretty well i mean that that ma[kes]-
sw04380-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04380-B_000574-000706 uh-huh
sw04380-B_001766-001899 really
sw04380-B_001899-002555 yeah i- i feel that my uh i'm a junior in college now and i go to Tech Georgia Tech
sw04380-B_002555-002717 and uh
sw04380-B_002849-002936 [laughter]
sw04380-B_002936-003191 okay [noise] uh
sw04380-B_003191-003543 i've the high school i went to was uh
sw04380-B_003543-004666 was a good one also and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because_1 the one i went to was you know
sw04380-B_004666-005295 i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta
sw04380-B_005473-005609 yeah
sw04380-B_006802-006926 what [vocalized-noise]
sw04380-B_007513-007699 yeah that's true
sw04380-B_008100-008496 yeah and i'm also i mean in the in those places where uh
sw04380-B_008496-009706 like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they
sw04380-B_009706-009853 [noise] yeah
sw04380-B_010424-010548 uh-huh
sw04380-B_010675-010872 yeah that's true
sw04380-B_011784-011929 right
sw04380-B_013380-013526 yeah
sw04380-B_014098-014326 that's hard for me to say since i didn't
sw04380-B_014326-015359 i didn't really grow well when i went to elementary school it it it wasn't in a great area but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know so i guess i can't really
sw04380-B_015359-015877 i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region
sw04380-B_015877-016847 [noise] you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the for those people
sw04380-B_016951-017093 [noise]
sw04380-B_017371-017778 so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to
sw04380-B_017778-018096 i don't get some kind of motivation to learn and
sw04380-B_018697-018822 uh-huh
sw04380-B_019701-019839 yeah
sw04380-B_020041-020168 uh-huh
sw04380-B_020465-020720 no i i can't say that i have either
sw04380-B_020821-020941 but uh
sw04380-B_021593-021981 yeah i've i've i've heard some i mean i've heard sta[tistics]- sta[tistics]- statistics and things that
sw04380-B_021981-022881 that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the same uh income groups
sw04380-B_022881-023603 if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh
sw04380-B_023718-024152 did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fair[ly]- you know fairly well
sw04380-B_024698-024836 yeah
sw04380-B_024836-025322 i [vocalized-noise] i know in my schools also i mean they they have a lot of uh
sw04380-B_025322-026725 once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh acc[elerated]- accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean tha[t]- that makes a big difference because_1 uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh
sw04380-B_026725-027255 with people that are really are interested in the in the subject and stuff like that
sw04380-B_029286-029423 uh-huh
sw04381-A_000000-001134 [noise] [vocalized-noise] um let's see so what's wrong with our public school system well i think uh i've been talked into that that one of the main problems is non directive education
sw04381-A_001134-002627 where you teach kids to basically have a good self image and assume that if they think good about themselves they will they will learn well for example if you [vocalized-noise] deal with uh math scores uh US math scores are
sw04381-A_002627-004052 um i don't know seventeenth out of twenty three industrialized nations we're really low i mean i'd be really even surprised if they were that high these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math
sw04381-A_004052-005507 they'll rank themselves much higher than will for example Korean students who do much better at math and um [noise] a number of educational theorists uh pre[dominately]- predominately conservative or they're called conservative because they think this i suppose
sw04381-A_005507-006602 say that the problem is that we've gotten away too much from teaching the kids the material and too much into let them let letting them discover what they feel or what they want to learn for themselves
sw04381-A_006602-007245 and that can be seen in you know in math scores it can be seen in sex education where we've had
sw04381-A_007245-008565 twenty years of generally available sex education in this country at the same time we have a rising crisis of teenage pregnancy uh it can be seen in the fact that students cheat a lot more at least admit to cheating a lot more than they used to
sw04381-A_008565-009824 they're not told what's right and what's wrong and they're not taught what they needed to be taught the urge they're they're they're taught to discover their own values and their own interest and if you let a kid do that that's the way to get
sw04381-A_009824-010183 uh you know to get no progress or very little progress
sw04381-A_011035-011132 um-hum
sw04381-A_011270-011349 um-hum
sw04381-A_011646-011791 um-hum um-hum
sw04381-A_012381-012476 um-hum
sw04381-A_012758-012843 um-hum
sw04381-A_013383-013537 yeah yeah
sw04381-A_013537-013659 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw04381-A_013659-013751 that's true
sw04381-A_014864-014940 yeah
sw04381-A_015061-015108 um-hum
sw04381-A_015108-015180 right well
sw04381-A_015411-015506 um-hum
sw04381-A_016340-016451 um-hum
sw04381-A_016664-016805 hum
sw04381-A_016931-017030 [vocalized-noise]
sw04381-A_017030-018395 well i work at NC State University and i do the same thing i spend i spend my own money to buy things that the university you know doesn't provide and i think little things like like transparency pens their transparency pens are pitiful
sw04381-A_018395-019846 i buy my own um i pay my own way on trips because they don't have any travel budget since nineteen ninety now uh i mean some of it comes from grants but what doesn't come from grants i pay pay for myself and in fact my business deductions are thousands of dollars a year more than the two percent
sw04381-A_019846-021206 uh limit so so th[e]- th[e]- same the same is true here but you know i- i ta[lked]- talked to one teacher about that at a wedding reception once and i said she said we need more pay i said yeah but but but what you need even more than that
sw04381-A_021206-022510 is you need more flexibility to do things the way you see that they should be done and she said yeah i agree with that entirely that the bureaucracy really hamstrings teachers um they they they in many places are just told what textbook to teach from
sw04381-A_022510-023974 whether or not they think it's a good one i mean the decision can be made from a central authority in the state to which is subject to lots of political pressure the teachers don't get to choose themselves what what book to teach uh uh teach from they go don't get to choose what order to cover things in and
sw04381-A_023974-025277 they really cannot adapt things to their teaching style in in into their kids uh that is a big problem and i think the large part of that problem is due to the educational bureaucracy here i go you know maligning some [laughter]
sw04381-A_025277-026561 some uh amorphous much maligned entity but i really think that that's a serious problem that that there's so many layers of administration to make sure that everything's done right that everybody's rights are respected
sw04381-A_026561-027777 so forth that there's no flexibility down at the at the at the bottom level and that's what the teachers have to deal with and and by the way that's another reason that their pay is so low because the administrators soak up so much of the budget
sw04381-A_028283-028382 um-hum
sw04381-A_028541-028643 yeah
sw04381-A_028643-029875 yeah well i think that that one way to solve the problem i mean i- i- you know if anything doesn't work right introduce competition and the the voucher a[pproach]- approach to um to to to paying for
sw04381-B_000000-000136 [noise]
sw04381-B_010284-011075 are those are are as you talk about that it reminds me of of one problem that i think is probably as far as my perception is the most glaring error
sw04381-B_011075-012435 that is because i know a lot of school teachers i know a lot of par[ticularly]- particularly girls who in like in their their thirties who teach school twenties and thirties and i'm appalled that we have that we pay our teachers so little
sw04381-B_012435-012788 and we give them so much so such a small budget to work with
sw04381-B_012788-013659 and with you know with a virtually nonexistent budget they have to supply decor[ation]- you know things bulletin boards on the rooms things for the kids to practice on textbooks
sw04381-B_013659-015089 and so so so the p[athetic]- the teachers themselves get a pathetic salary and they end up almost across the board taking some of their own money which they don't have and buying school supplies so that they can they can teach their kids and their dedication astounds me
sw04381-B_015089-015182 and i
sw04381-B_015182-015686 i don't know i don't know if we're getting a quality education from [vocalized-noise] teachers who are underpaid
sw04381-B_015686-016457 but i'm sure i'm sure that it it's like uh i work at AT&T and now i- i if i want to spend four hundred dollars um
sw04381-B_016457-016737 i don't even have to i don't have to ask anybody i just go do it
sw04381-B_016737-017063 that's probably the teacher's entire budget for the year if they're lucky
sw04381-B_027885-028324 yeah i think so i oh for example they will have a a million dollar building
sw04381-B_028324-028568 but no no money for supplies
sw04382-A_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04382-A_000061-000435 [noise] well here in Logan Utah
sw04382-A_000435-001036 we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
sw04382-A_001144-001653 when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
sw04382-A_004737-004860 yeah
sw04382-A_004860-005142 yeah definitely here in Utah
sw04382-A_005142-005536 up along the Wasatch front along the
sw04382-A_005536-006499 western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
sw04382-A_006499-007074 we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars
sw04382-A_007074-007248 and uh
sw04382-A_007359-007829 it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the [noise] inversion and when we get
sw04382-A_007936-009104 get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago
sw04382-A_009104-010011 it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys
sw04382-A_011053-011162 [noise]
sw04382-A_011605-011716 huh
sw04382-A_012091-013106 they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions
sw04382-A_013233-014037 yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because_1 we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here
sw04382-A_016342-016456 yeah
sw04382-A_016697-016963 yep they're ge[tting]- eliminating that out here
sw04382-A_016963-017352 they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun
sw04382-A_017352-018042 where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the
sw04382-A_018042-018520 basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun
sw04382-A_018520-018759 and yes
sw04382-A_018759-019411 yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light
sw04382-A_019411-020223 and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually
sw04382-A_020223-020361 and
sw04382-A_020489-021138 like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at uh
sw04382-A_021138-021271 other
sw04382-A_021271-021840 you know ways of monitoring this and because_1 they found out something basically that uh
sw04382-A_021840-022720 and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much
sw04382-A_022720-022865 um
sw04382-A_022865-023227 of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons
sw04382-A_023227-023799 then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up
sw04382-A_023799-024510 all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the
sw04382-A_024510-024730 the pollution then
sw04382-A_024730-025136 you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half
sw04382-A_027753-027866 uh-huh
sw04382-A_029062-029176 um
sw04382-A_029280-029405 yeah and they're

sw04382-B_001638-001747 hm
sw04382-B_001941-002621 well here in Seattle uh it's giv[ing]- the air's getting more and more polluted to where uh we're in kind of a basin
sw04382-B_002621-002813 and uh
sw04382-B_002813-003037 [noise]
sw04382-B_003037-003325 Seattle's on Puget Sound which is a
sw04382-B_003325-003633 inland waterway between two mountains
sw04382-B_003633-004267 and uh there's been a lot of lot of growth population growth around here
sw04382-B_004267-004976 and uh it's uh it's getting worse [laughter] i think most of it is from cars
sw04382-B_007003-007144 um-hum
sw04382-B_009022-009156 uh-oh
sw04382-B_009963-010091 yeah
sw04382-B_010266-010592 yeah i live in the university district and uh
sw04382-B_010698-011113 uh it's supposed to have about the worst air [laughter-pollution]
sw04382-B_011113-011641 i think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school
sw04382-B_011641-011977 and i'm we're right next to Interstate 5 also
sw04382-B_012986-013305 oh yeah oh yeah they started doing that yet
sw04382-B_014012-014905 [noise] we have that here and uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here um as the population spreads out
sw04382-B_014905-015200 and i think they're also gonna be making it uh
sw04382-B_015314-015737 mandatory for more cars th[ere]- there was uh
sw04382-B_015737-016663 something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and i think they're eliminating that uh
sw04382-B_016787-017067 [vocalized-noise] that loophole yeah
sw04382-B_018564-018827 oh really they make you do that remotely
sw04382-B_020190-020499 hm [noise] now where does the source light go
sw04382-B_020638-020796 oh i see
sw04382-B_022690-022832 jeez
sw04382-B_025115-025244 yeah that's neat
sw04382-B_025244-025348 [noise]
sw04382-B_025348-025491 but it's also been uh
sw04382-B_025610-026057 oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but
sw04382-B_026057-026187 it uh
sw04382-B_026187-026653 it's tough you know like i've i've looked into riding the bus to work and
sw04382-B_026653-026989 i can drive to work in uh
sw04382-B_026989-027804 [noise] and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges
sw04382-B_027804-027985 but if i uh
sw04382-B_027985-028098 [noise]
sw04382-B_028098-028703 if i take the bus it requires several transfers
sw04382-B_028703-029050 and it takes over an hour
sw04382-B_029151-029334 [laughter]
sw04382-B_029334-029895 so it it's it's not hard to see [laughter-why] [laughter-i] why i keep driving and you know i feel guilty because_1 i'm driving a
sw04383-A_000000-000476 [noise] do you think should be done for the the uh huge budget we have
sw04383-A_002980-003656 yeah i know Graham Krugman that guy Krug[man]- was it uh Grudman he's [vocalized-noise] he's not going for
sw04383-A_003656-004325 we elected him for that uh again and he said that he didn't think that we'd ever be able to have uh balanced budget
sw04383-A_004325-004403 [laughter]
sw04383-A_005673-005810 um-hum
sw04383-A_006189-006454 we'll be like California soon right
sw04383-A_006454-006656 or what or New York
sw04383-A_006656-006723 [laughter]
sw04383-A_006830-007040 yep totally
sw04383-A_007040-007246 everything yeah
sw04383-A_007246-007757 the year two thousand that uh we'd be totally dependent on foreign capital
sw04383-A_007757-007901 and
sw04383-A_008008-008123 yeah
sw04383-A_010560-010687 huh
sw04383-A_011437-011967 well [vocalized-noise] you go were the money is and if you don't have the money anymore
sw04383-A_011967-012132 then that's that
sw04383-A_012132-012260 um
sw04383-A_013125-013345 performance right
sw04383-A_013345-013589 attach performance
sw04383-A_013589-013704 [vocalized-noise]
sw04383-A_014028-014147 uh-huh
sw04383-A_014147-014416 certainly do [laughter]
sw04383-A_015602-016565 well actually their [vocalized-noise] well that's one thing but we also got to change the voting stuff and the uh special interest groups and all that stuff
sw04383-A_016565-017693 you know we we take a lot of the blame for it we have to start voting we have to start talking we have to start uh doing something about it but we're so apathetic it's almost ridiculous
sw04383-A_018746-018856 um-hum
sw04383-A_019457-019792 oh i understand that but we have to go to vote
sw04383-A_019792-020339 we have to uh participate in political parties or something uh
sw04383-A_020339-020638 those kinds of things and we don't even do that
sw04383-A_020638-020787 [vocalized-noise]
sw04383-A_021300-021988 oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights
sw04383-A_021988-022508 i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean
sw04383-A_022508-022666 um
sw04383-A_022666-023210 that would definitely cut down on the consumerism [vocalized-noise] and which really pushes
sw04383-A_023310-024554 a lot of the uh you know it'd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment
sw04383-A_024786-024889 [noise]
sw04383-A_025736-026433 well i don't know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it it's just a matter of mobilizing
sw04383-A_026433-027113 uh you know the people that do it it's a very difficult task i'm not saying that any of this is easy [laughter]
sw04383-A_027545-027686 yeah
sw04383-A_027804-028986 well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now
sw04383-A_028986-029476 y[ou]- you know that's coming to a point where that's less li[kely]- less and less likely
sw04383-A_029476-029776 right economic ruling brought that down
sw04383-B_000000-000116 [noise]
sw04383-B_000546-001899 uh uh well i think the first thing that every every time they talk about it they they say well we can't cut this or we don't need to cut this out of the budget because_1 it's such a small amount in comparison to the overall [decifit/deficit] deficit
sw04383-B_001899-002029 but
sw04383-B_002029-002298 i think they need to start doing it i mean
sw04383-B_002298-002997 the taxes are going to grow so high there's no way we'll ever pay off what we owe now our children is going to pay it
sw04383-B_004309-004848 [laughter] i don't think so they had an article in the paper here the other day about
sw04383-B_004848-005038 uh [noise]
sw04383-B_005038-005738 the interest alone in the year two thousand's going to be more than John Kennedy's entire budget
sw04383-B_005738-006214 and when it's it's gone ridiculous now i don't know what's going to happen
sw04383-B_006647-006872 [laughter] bankrupt
sw04383-B_007054-007185 [vocalized-noise]
sw04383-B_007786-008019 i think so like Japan
sw04383-B_008121-008234 uh
sw04383-B_008336-008588 i don't know if that's such a bad thing
sw04383-B_008588-008727 one so
sw04383-B_008828-009043 once Japan becomes
sw04383-B_009043-009670 if we're dependent on them they're most certainly dependent upon us i don't think that the world market would
sw04383-B_009882-010597 would be as possible for them with out us i mean i don't think Europe is consumer oriented as we are
sw04383-B_010597-011406 they more or less have to sell to us whether where else would you sell that many Toyotas and Hondas and stuff it'd have to be here
sw04383-B_012115-012270 yeah
sw04383-B_012270-012709 i don't know i think the first thing we could do is uh
sw04383-B_012709-013259 i'd like to see Congress [vocalized-noise] attached to the [decifit/deficit] or you know or
sw04383-B_013259-013398 uh
sw04383-B_013517-014091 yeah performance calls like you might have at work or or i might have too
sw04383-B_014091-014217 yeah
sw04383-B_014319-014505 [laughter] you do
sw04383-B_014505-014683 i do too uh it's uh
sw04383-B_014683-014931 i don't know why they should be uh
sw04383-B_014931-015175 unregulated and and
sw04383-B_015175-015648 over the last twenty years we've strictly gone down hill and the salary's gone up
sw04383-B_017676-017938 well for one thing uh
sw04383-B_017938-018143 we've got lives to live
sw04383-B_018143-018773 i mean for us to uh to stay knowledgeable on all these issues it's a full time job
sw04383-B_018773-019421 i mean i go to work every day just like you do i don't i can't sit down and keep up with all of this that's why we elect them
sw04383-B_019618-019745 [vocalized-noise]
sw04383-B_019745-019891 yeah
sw04383-B_020591-021300 no i- i don't even think uh participation would have [vocalized-noise] as far as democrats and republicans go it'd have to be a third party
sw04383-B_024672-024799 um
sw04383-B_024799-024955 [noise]
sw04383-B_024955-025686 you know [vocalized-noise] do you sometimes think it's got to a hopeless position now that there's nothing we could do to reverse it
sw04383-B_027023-027540 you know we're we're talking about numbers that i can't even comprehend
sw04383-B_027540-027858 [vocalized-noise] the numbers were too large for me
sw04384-A_000000-000029 [noise]
sw04384-A_000029-000475 the only experience i have i don't have any children but i've um [noise]
sw04384-A_000475-001589 i was a babysitter in high school and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist while she worked and i just
sw04384-A_001589-001755 uh-huh
sw04384-A_001755-001943 is it
sw04384-A_002548-002850 oh yeah the expense
sw04384-A_003401-003547 uh-huh
sw04384-A_003864-004098 just sit around [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sw04384-A_004253-005272 that's true see the lady i did it for that's why she p[icked]- picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up so she could sleep in
sw04384-A_005272-006041 and um then she could be at home and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but um
sw04384-A_006041-007107 she paid i think it was two or th[ree]- it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or
sw04384-A_007107-007343 gas or anything
sw04384-A_007343-007533 yeah
sw04384-A_008055-008196 right
sw04384-A_009546-009727 oh wow
sw04384-A_010291-010412 [laughter]
sw04384-A_010941-011099 wow
sw04384-A_011381-011507 yeah
sw04384-A_011662-012126 i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters
sw04384-A_012240-013027 and they stick around for longer because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said [laughter-bag] it and i quit you [laughter-know]
sw04384-A_013027-013364 i was just like but i'm wasting my time
sw04384-A_013364-013671 i really liked the little girl and everything but i thought
sw04384-A_013801-014043 yeah yeah i
sw04384-A_014043-015012 [laughter] uh-huh [laughter] well and she was really spoiled they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch
sw04384-A_015012-015964 and the mom was a dentist and i was just like we've got to quit this [laughter] and she's like no i don't want her to starve but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat [laughter]
sw04384-A_015964-016061 like
sw04384-A_016061-016146 [laughter]
sw04384-A_016146-016326 eat this or [laughter]
sw04384-A_016326-016487 [noise]
sw04384-A_016487-017435 so i can see the concerns on what different people want because some i mean you know if i was setting up a day care there would be so many needs you would have to
sw04384-A_017435-017753 customize your service to
sw04384-A_017753-018139 because_1 some parents won't put up with anything where others would
sw04384-A_018568-018713 uh-huh
sw04384-A_019013-019135 no
sw04384-A_019418-020006 that's true i i'd love to do it but i just don't trust people now there's too many lawsuits
sw04384-A_020006-020337 i just i think it's a bigger risk than
sw04384-A_020451-020565 yeah
sw04384-A_020565-021283 it would scare me with i don't know because_1 i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue but i think a lot of them are just
sw04384-A_021283-021739 you know they're negligent and they get happy about money and
sw04384-A_021739-021941 they just want to sue you
sw04384-A_022317-022446 um-hum
sw04384-A_022836-023045 oh yeah
sw04384-A_023045-023266 that's impossible
sw04384-A_023773-024266 i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and
sw04384-A_024266-024899 i mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them_1 she'd like to turn them_1 into the state [laughter]
sw04384-A_024899-025818 and that's the people that are working there you know and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know
sw04384-A_025818-026275 like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper
sw04384-A_026275-026531 you know just awful things and
sw04384-A_026531-027105 so i don't know i don't have kids but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody
sw04384-A_027105-027296 i mean you just don't know
sw04384-A_028024-028219 oh yeah
sw04384-A_028219-028373 that's true
sw04384-A_028631-028764 yeah
sw04384-A_028931-029234 it would just rip me apart i think [noise] i don't know
sw04384-A_029358-029475 not knowing
sw04384-B_000000-000072 [noise]
sw04384-B_001600-002662 yeah that's the only thing i've ever done also is babysit but um i've heard people that i work with talk about you know child care especially i guess it's even harder on single mothers
sw04384-B_002662-003499 yeah having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock or it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff like that
sw04384-B_003499-003842 which is understandable i mean these people can't you know
sw04384-B_003842-004194 stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late but
sw04384-B_007065-007228 oh no
sw04384-B_007228-007484 yeah it's hardly worth your time
sw04384-B_007484-008150 yeah that's pretty bad the only time i babysat was in high school and it you know of course you don't ha[ve]- i didn't pay taxes on that so
sw04384-B_008150-008651 it was easy you know go over to some um it was these people that lived in our neighborhood and
sw04384-B_008651-009732 i'd just go over there every Thursday night they went to the theater they had permanent tickets and they'd give me it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids but they would usually give me m[ore]- like five dollars more at the end of the night
sw04384-B_009732-010079 and i mean they'd you know it was great i'd go over there and there would be like
sw04384-B_010079-011502 uh you know there's we have these videos over here watch whatever you want and there's some Oreos in the in the cupboard and there's some Coke and you know just help yourself to anything so it was it was you know the best that was a long time ago and that was only for a few years just once a week
sw04384-B_011502-011627 but [noise]
sw04384-B_011627-011749 i don't know
sw04384-B_012071-012285 oh yeah that's true
sw04384-B_012970-013089 yeah
sw04384-B_013323-013395 yeah
sw04384-B_013596-013895 she does take up and they do take up a lot of your time that
sw04384-B_013895-014149 they're very demanding [laughter]
sw04384-B_014149-014320 [laughter]
sw04384-B_014956-015091 [laughter]
sw04384-B_015870-016104 oh shoot my mom would be like
sw04384-B_016104-016230 um
sw04384-B_016230-016471 eat it or don't eat anything that's right
sw04384-B_016883-017010 yeah
sw04384-B_017453-017565 yeah
sw04384-B_017703-017790 um-hum
sw04384-B_018192-018597 i think yeah i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement
sw04384-B_018597-019499 and just have like t[en]- at the most like ten kids and all from maybe people that you know type of thing instead of trying actually to set up a day care where you don't know the people coming in and
sw04384-B_019963-020063 yeah
sw04384-B_020349-020533 more than what it's worth
sw04384-B_020533-020634 yeah
sw04384-B_021691-021806 yeah
sw04384-B_021927-022961 well yeah that's yeah exactly when you have like a Kindercare or something set up and th[ey]- when they get greedy or whatever that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
sw04384-B_022961-023537 and that's just you know you can't watch k[ids]- that many little kids getting into things at one time
sw04384-B_023537-023811 you know you never know what they're going to get into
sw04384-B_025727-025911 oh that's horrible
sw04384-B_026241-026372 um
sw04384-B_026563-026656 um
sw04384-B_027067-027444 yeah that's the the yeah that's a hard thing about it if i mean
sw04384-B_027444-028700 i don't i can't foresee myself getting married but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work i mean i don't think i could trust somebody with my kid either unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well
sw04384-B_028700-028981 i just i couldn't do it i don't think
sw04384-B_029204-029325 yeah
sw04384-B_029325-029939 yeah just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait

sw04387-A_012472-012645 [noise]
sw04387-A_012980-013151 [noise]
sw04387-A_014190-014320 oh yeah

sw04387-A_016247-016350 that's right
sw04387-A_016492-017299 oh a an exception to the classical music though the thing i really like is the sound track or the stage recording of the uh Phantom of the Opera
sw04387-A_017299-017526 [noise]
sw04387-A_017774-017935 [noise]
sw04387-A_020927-021289 oh yeah [laughter] yeah
sw04387-A_021289-021834 we're we're blessed in Dallas with a new symphony center just a few years old
sw04387-A_021834-022198 it was designed by I M Pei and it's absolutely fabulous
sw04387-A_022198-022750 i mean e[very]- every note [laughter] it's just it it's something [laughter-else]
sw04387-A_022750-023447 i've tried to get tickets to the Pops concert uh series next year along with the symphony
sw04387-A_023447-024183 so i i really haven't heard anything in this marvelous hall except for the classical music and the Christmas concert
sw04387-A_024338-025334 yes oh this was this was uh so exciting when everybody stood up and su[ng]- sang a couple of the songs and we've got a few thousand people singing [laughter]
sw04387-A_025334-025745 [laughter] and they could drown me out with [laughter-my] [laughter-bad] voice
sw04387-A_025893-026026 [laughter]
sw04387-A_026321-027031 yeah uh you said you liked instrumental music are you partial to pianos or guitars or do you prefer
sw04387-A_027449-027605 oh is that right
sw04387-A_029709-029846 uh-huh
sw04387-A_029914-029952 [vocalized-noise]
sw04387-B_000000-000165 [noise]
sw04387-B_000165-001122 uh it it varies i[t's]- it's totally dependent upon what mood i'm in it can be anything from classical to um uh rock and roll
sw04387-B_001289-001874 no not hard rock i'm i'm talking like Elton John or uh Steve Winwood or something like that
sw04387-B_002512-003162 uh usually the the the album sounds better than the concert and i don't like fighting the crowds [laughter]
sw04387-B_003945-004094 um-hum
sw04387-B_005064-005809 yeah yeah come to think of it i saw the Four Tops uh about three years ago
sw04387-B_006308-006540 yeah it was it was a lot of fun
sw04387-B_006982-007109 [vocalized-noise]
sw04387-B_007586-008285 yeah that that that is something i i'd rather it's one of those things where i have a very stressful day at work and then i'll
sw04387-B_008285-009016 get home and let's uh pick pick out a something on the symphony something that will really relax me
sw04387-B_009016-010119 and uh that that's where that is and the one thing uh i guess it's opera's the only kind of music that i i- i don't care for and
sw04387-B_010119-010623 uh traditional country and western which i find [laughter-offensive]
sw04387-B_010623-012333 [laughter]
sw04387-B_012333-013153 yeah like i said it depends upon the mood that i'm in um i- i prefer instrumental more tha[n]- over anything
sw04387-B_013153-014215 but what i don't like is listening to a a station that will play uh i guess it's elevator music where they they have people that re[done]- have redone the song
sw04387-B_014215-015168 it's if if if i'm going to listen to something like White Christmas i want to hear Bing Crosby sing it i don't want to hear somebody else sing it
sw04387-B_015168-015743 um i'm i'm a firm believer in the person who made the song popular that's who i want to listen to
sw04387-B_015922-016198 regardless of how good the remake is [laughter]
sw04387-B_016198-016463 or how good they think the [laughter-remake] [laughter-is]
sw04387-B_017248-017879 yes that that that's really good i enjoy that um and that's where
sw04387-B_017879-018851 very rarely live recordings of uh symphony music is good where they have to they have to get everyone in the studio to do it right
sw04387-B_018851-020245 depending upon which hall they're in because_1 i've listened to some uh albums or CD's where the live recording they did it in a an auditorium or hall that was horrible the acoustics
sw04387-B_020245-021038 and it just kind of washed out the very highs and the very lows and you had this [vocalized-noise] what sounded like m[ud]- mud music
sw04387-B_021193-021404 it was like why bother
sw04387-B_021759-021894 um-hum
sw04387-B_022419-022581 oh boy
sw04387-B_023349-023472 um-hum

sw04387-B_025666-026030 well with my voice i'm glad that they drown me out [laughter]
