sw04348-A_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04348-A_000027-000515 so it's kind of an obsolete question at this point since there isn't a soviet union anymore but
sw04348-A_000812-001677 for former right right w- we can say the the the the soon to be former uh commonwealth of independent states instead is that
sw04348-A_001677-001813 and
sw04348-A_002325-003203 i- i don't consider them so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that we're already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country
sw04348-A_003203-003917 you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more about than the soviet union
sw04348-A_004099-004901 you know i mean we already had the case where they had those uh guys selling ura- trying to sell uranium on the open market
sw04348-A_005681-006847 yeah and and in fact i i've been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so they don't go to libya or somewhere like that
sw04348-A_007527-008719 right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fair- is fairly high
sw04348-A_008719-009179 but you know there's certainly a lot of people arguing there right now who all have nuclear weapons
sw04348-A_009179-009861 and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign uh republics who are a lot of them islamic
sw04348-A_009861-011144 some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they break off and [vocalized-noise] for instance decide to align with iran or iraq then suddenly we're in a very difficult position
sw04348-A_011828-011970 um
sw04348-A_012247-012379 yeah
sw04348-A_013517-013997 right and and the of course the other thing is you've got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and
sw04348-A_013997-015328 all of that so there's the whole question whether one of the [vocalized-noise] uh sub drivers is gonna decide to become free lance oh i don't wanna i don't wanna go with russia so i'm going to uh you know sell myself to the highest bidder or something
sw04348-A_015810-015966 right
sw04348-A_016595-017223 right you know the o- the other possible scenario of course is that in in i- it's gonna be hard for the entire
sw04348-A_017223-018271 area to have them but for instance you can see in russia especially now there's a lot of hard liners coming back because th- the economic reforms aren't working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again
sw04348-A_018271-019630 the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons
sw04348-A_020285-020413 yeah
sw04348-A_020778-021794 yeah but i i have to say i think all o- overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually sta- more stable than they were before because
sw04348-A_021794-022965 i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the united states
sw04348-A_023165-024398 yeah i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh not looking to us for you know uh invasion at this point
sw04348-A_026095-026826 um-hum so you know i- i think it it's more gonna be i don't think we're looking at [vocalized-noise] uh potential for anything large scale
sw04348-A_026826-027851 um you know i think there's certainly some people in in the us government who would like us to think that they're still a threat um you know i was listening to m._p._r. yesterday talk about the sea hawk submarine
sw04348-A_027851-028934 and you know i'm saying you know wait a minute here why do we wanna build like two or three multibillion dollar submarines you know and the reason is to keep gratin connecticut at all alive but
sw04348-A_028934-029856 yeah i- i think that there's there are people in government who perc- who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore
sw04348-B_000000-000058 [noise]
sw04348-B_000448-000878 right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that former soviet union
sw04348-B_001522-002399 that that's true too on that one well i- i- i personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us
sw04348-B_003824-004251 tha- that that's very true i- i would agree with that also or
sw04348-B_004795-005898 that that part is very true there's also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by
sw04348-B_006759-007630 sure so i mean yeah so i i- i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the soviet union that's threatening us though
sw04348-B_008115-008280 [noise]
sw04348-B_011068-011949 sure a- another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area
sw04348-B_011949-012308 since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different commonwealths
sw04348-B_012308-013057 uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not type
sw04348-B_013057-013592 systems i mean what what's the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor
sw04348-B_014605-014724 right
sw04348-B_015252-015827 absolutely so yeah that that that whole thing is a very scary thing destabulation de- destabilization
sw04348-B_015827-016410 and let it let it choke on that one uh the uh you know the soviet union has been a uh
sw04348-B_016410-016674 a big concern it's a scary thing
sw04348-B_018249-018389 sure
sw04348-B_019496-020344 tha- tha- that's very true um you know granted that you know the cold war was a very scary thing but at least it was a non commodity
sw04348-B_020344-020883 you know we we knew what we we're you know we knew what we were up against
sw04348-B_022885-023246 well especially now that they're divided they're not bigger than we are anymore
sw04348-B_024195-025217 yeah i- i think it is very true uh you know we're once again even the even the ones that aren't necessarily looking for help from us you know they getting massive amounts of help or or wanting that from germany and
sw04348-B_025217-026202 from other from other third world countries so that would that would probably also keep you know blatant uh uh you know acts of war out of the uh picture
sw04348-B_029747-029856 sure
sw04349-A_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04349-A_000050-000682 the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four nissan truck
sw04349-A_000682-001241 i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it
sw04349-A_001241-001752 and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
sw04349-A_001752-002075 and it has eight spark plugs
sw04349-A_002075-002613 and it's hard to to get get at them and plus
sw04349-A_002613-003039 the time [vocalized-noise] i just don't have time anymore um
sw04349-A_003152-003508 as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself
sw04349-A_003698-004629 i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i- i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once
sw04349-A_004629-004799 but
sw04349-A_004799-005230 the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes [noise] i wanted
sw04349-A_005230-006667 i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs t- should be changed re- very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubri- lubrication system needs to kee- be lubricated and
sw04349-A_006886-007757 so i- i stay on top of that [noise] but i- [noise] i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed
sw04349-A_007757-008622 and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
sw04349-A_008622-009432 just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they ch- i had them another thing i- i let them do sometimes is that
sw04349-A_009432-010504 i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
sw04349-A_010504-011165 and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know
sw04349-A_011165-012122 but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus
sw04349-A_012122-012447 and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but
sw04349-A_012447-012940 i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a me-
sw04349-A_012940-013745 a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i- i still have a pretty good feel for it
sw04349-A_013745-014125 but one thing i didn't know is that
sw04349-A_014248-014730 when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i ha- i had bigger cars
sw04349-A_014730-015462 and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan
sw04349-A_015462-015965 i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten
sw04349-A_015965-016287 so i drove on those brake pads
sw04349-A_016287-017475 for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that th- they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
sw04349-A_017656-017782 ex-
sw04349-A_017868-018569 exactly so i you know but i- i just did it anyway i like to st- i like to stay up on it you know like to st- kind of stay up on it then
sw04349-A_018569-019150 if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time
sw04349-A_019150-019350 and pull my dip stick
sw04349-A_019350-020359 and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i- i- i keep it that way because that's
sw04349-A_020359-020733 that is the key to the longevity so
sw04349-A_020733-020892 s- so how
sw04349-A_021426-021572 uh-huh
sw04349-A_021800-021962 uh oh [laughter]
sw04349-A_021962-022007 [laughter]
sw04349-A_022389-022533 uh-huh
sw04349-A_022877-023023 um-hum
sw04349-A_023145-023278 okay
sw04349-A_024303-024460 um-hum
sw04349-A_025102-025429 you're talking about the vibration dampener
sw04349-A_025758-026019 that's the vibration dampener yeah
sw04349-A_026169-026326 okay
sw04349-A_026865-027031 hm
sw04349-A_027378-027543 uh oh
sw04349-A_027858-027991 hm
sw04349-A_028107-028273 uh oh
sw04349-A_028273-028420 hm
sw04349-A_028920-029101 [laughter]
sw04349-A_029633-029785 um-hum
sw04349-B_000000-000063 [noise]
sw04349-B_000063-008551 [noise]
sw04349-B_008551-008853 just to pack the bearings
sw04349-B_010441-010599 right
sw04349-B_011949-012251 right and they repacked the wheel bearings
sw04349-B_017395-017981 you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface material on the pads is so good
sw04349-B_020540-020730 right
sw04349-B_020730-020892 well
sw04349-B_020892-021172 it it sounds like you've had um
sw04349-B_021172-021511 some good experiences with that uh
sw04349-B_021511-021875 and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
sw04349-B_021875-022134 um i
sw04349-B_022134-022556 i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh
sw04349-B_022556-023193 and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit
sw04349-B_023193-024106 and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can
sw04349-B_024106-024789 use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were
sw04349-B_024789-025222 um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum
sw04349-B_025385-025985 well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley
sw04349-B_025985-026284 and uh the water pump pulley
sw04349-B_026284-026456 so
sw04349-B_026456-026957 when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things
sw04349-B_026957-027111 and uh
sw04349-B_027111-027475 probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out
sw04349-B_027475-028156 so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
sw04349-B_028156-028366 but not far enough to notice
sw04349-B_028366-029001 so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
sw04349-B_029001-029103 [laughter]
sw04349-B_029103-029907 so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i
sw04350-A_000000-000867 [noise] well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um
sw04350-A_000867-002195 health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um [noise] facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day
sw04350-A_003025-003283 um yeah same here
sw04350-A_003897-004073 um
sw04350-A_004218-004358 yeah
sw04350-A_004486-004652 yeah
sw04350-A_005773-006261 another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours
sw04350-A_006384-006597 [noise] yeah [noise]
sw04350-A_006597-007099 [noise] well right now i'm still in school i'm still a student but the ability to
sw04350-A_007099-008213 you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that
sw04350-A_008213-008766 feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that
sw04350-A_008766-008966 and
sw04350-A_009188-009349 [noise] yeah
sw04350-A_009570-009719 [noise]
sw04350-A_009887-010241 [vocalized-noise]
sw04350-A_010502-010727 yeah that can be rough
sw04350-A_010727-011107 yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that
sw04350-A_011107-011477 [noise] swore to never do it again
sw04350-A_011477-012332 i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of
sw04350-A_012332-012986 um [noise] like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place
sw04350-A_012986-013663 um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more
sw04350-A_013663-013925 they get um allowances for
sw04350-A_013925-014823 um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case
sw04350-A_014823-015202 but um they get housing and stuff like that [noise]
sw04350-A_015465-016074 and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that
sw04350-A_016074-017091 but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how
sw04350-A_017091-018274 you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing
sw04350-A_018274-018562 some kind of consideration there would be nice as well
sw04350-A_018562-018889 i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh
sw04350-A_018889-019238 not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place
sw04350-A_019238-019574 if they're just gonna pork you in the end
sw04350-A_020549-020717 yeah
sw04350-A_020717-020901 yeah
sw04350-A_021805-022124 yeah it's a good consideration for families
sw04350-A_022124-022506 that's absolute necessity in today's world and price
sw04350-A_022506-022785 man they're getting so expensive
sw04350-A_022785-023217 right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you
sw04350-A_023217-023667 no i'm gonna be thirty this year but [laughter]
sw04350-A_023667-023948 and yeah i'm working on my phd
sw04350-A_023948-025051 it's a long road [noise] but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if
sw04350-A_025051-026075 if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then
sw04350-A_026075-026320 georgia tech in atlanta
sw04350-A_026320-027407 [noise] but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that
sw04350-A_027407-028602 and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasn't prepared to pay for it i'm not too sure what i'm gonna do about that right now there's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant feeling worrying about that
sw04350-A_029298-029475 hm
sw04350-A_029638-029856 is there any deductible with that or anything like
sw04350-B_000000-000084 [noise]
sw04350-B_002039-003163 i- i definitely agree on that um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever
sw04350-B_003163-003354 um [laughter]
sw04350-B_003354-003970 but as far as what i'd really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could
sw04350-B_003970-004743 if there was some sort of pro- provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to chan- to take a shower before work
sw04350-B_004743-004953 and some place to lock the bicycles up
sw04350-B_004953-005226 and i've heard of a lot of other companies providing that
sw04350-B_005226-005404 that would be something to look forward to
sw04350-B_005404-005566 um
sw04350-B_005566-005675 [noise]
sw04350-B_005675-005864 let's see
sw04350-B_006154-006492 [laughter] well a lot depends on the job though [laughter]
sw04350-B_006492-006661 what do you do
sw04350-B_006779-006936 oh okay
sw04350-B_008147-008301 right
sw04350-B_008646-008848 yeah that would be nice
sw04350-B_008848-009263 i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment you're in
sw04350-B_009263-009609 um [noise] i'm right now also a full time student
sw04350-B_009609-009955 and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm
sw04350-B_009955-010226 so it's a ra- yeah it's a rather interesting uh
sw04350-B_010226-010820 [noise] rather in- interesting set up [noise] work full time go to school full time
sw04350-B_010995-011209 [laughter]
sw04350-B_011209-011375 but
sw04350-B_012890-013054 how so

sw04350-B_019504-020491 um what a lot what a lot of companies do is fa- as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family
sw04350-B_020491-020832 in a lot of cases i know that's the case in my office at least
sw04350-B_020832-021658 they'll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and depend- codependent children not like the case applies to me but um
sw04350-B_021658-021886 it is nice that they offer it
sw04350-B_022266-022602 definitely and health insurance costs
sw04350-B_023040-023289 you you're not still covered under your parents

sw04350-B_027342-027488 wow
sw04350-B_028382-028545 right now
sw04350-B_028545-029160 right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think it's thirty dollars a month
sw04350-B_029160-029350 so that'll be at three sixty a year
sw04350-B_029350-029621 and that's basic uh group health coverage
sw04350-B_029758-029856 no
sw04351-A_000000-000147 [noise] home [laughter] because i'm
sw04351-A_000147-000308 leaving from work
sw04351-A_000308-001110 okay well uh i don't know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the army
sw04351-A_001110-002323 active duty twenty years and of course when you're active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness
sw04351-A_002323-003252 but you're required to take a what we call a p. t. test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year
sw04351-A_003252-004213 so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group
sw04351-A_004213-005211 and if you didn't pass the test [noise] then they put you on what they called remedial p. t. and every morning you have to go to the company and
sw04351-A_005211-006009 jog in formation [laughter] in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment
sw04351-A_006009-006135 [laughter]
sw04351-A_006375-007125 what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running
sw04351-A_007125-007884 and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so
sw04351-A_007884-008632 now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in virginia and i live in maryland
sw04351-A_008632-009219 and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here
sw04351-A_009219-010009 which is about fifty miles work all day [laughter] fifty miles back on the capitol beltway and of course it's dark by the time i get home and
sw04351-A_010009-010568 so i have to admit [laughter] that i i have fallen off uh slightly
sw04351-A_010568-010916 or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely
sw04351-A_010916-011506 and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday
sw04351-A_011506-012056 so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have
sw04351-A_012056-013131 yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet
sw04351-A_013131-013342 and uh how about yourself
sw04351-A_013613-013801 um uh-huh
sw04351-A_014074-014215 uh-huh
sw04351-A_014412-014752 um so you have a good sustained work out
sw04351-A_014752-014918 yeah
sw04351-A_014918-015545 oh yeah yeah that's that is a long time to have [laughter] at it but that's of course uh
sw04351-A_015545-016195 uh there's a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i don't know does that cause you any injuries or anything
sw04351-A_016299-016429 no
sw04351-A_016921-017071 uh-huh
sw04351-A_017071-017400 right either an elbow in the eye
sw04351-A_017549-017693 right
sw04351-A_017849-018532 uh-huh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive
sw04351-A_018532-019398 uh i didn't have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me
sw04351-A_019398-019949 and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit
sw04351-A_019949-020824 but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at
sw04351-A_020824-021556 fort ben harrison indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise
sw04351-A_021556-021731 that sort of thing and
sw04351-A_021731-022128 so at least from that i [noise] i realize the importance of it
sw04351-A_022128-022231 and uh
sw04351-A_022747-022917 uh
sw04351-A_022917-024032 not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit
sw04351-A_024032-025260 and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while [noise] but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape
sw04351-A_025260-026112 and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement
sw04351-A_026112-026889 through just simple things like you're going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh [noise]
sw04351-A_026889-027605 uh matter of fact i've very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to
sw04351-A_027605-028130 but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to
sw04351-A_028130-029123 but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in h- in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good
sw04351-A_029123-029962 yeah and uh so she's slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program
sw04351-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04351-B_000049-000245 [laughter]
sw04351-B_000245-000367 yeah
sw04351-B_001275-001390 um

sw04351-B_006044-006184 [laughter]
sw04351-B_006184-006679 well so now that you're out of that what what sort of regime do you keep up with
sw04351-B_007070-007189 uh-huh
sw04351-B_007822-007963 oh wow
sw04351-B_008566-008683 uh-huh

sw04351-B_011432-011576 uh-huh
sw04351-B_012009-012164 definitely
sw04351-B_012424-012542 right
sw04351-B_013043-013171 uh-huh
sw04351-B_013338-013745 well i i generally play tennis two or three times a week
sw04351-B_013745-014505 and that's that's by enlarge about the only form of exercise i get but when i go out and play i generally play for two or three hours at a time
sw04351-B_014505-014660 so
sw04351-B_014660-015152 yeah so that that's that's quite strenuous for that long of a period
sw04351-B_016096-017280 [noise] um not not generally i i uh [noise] the few times i try and play basketball it seems like i always always sprain an ankle or twist a finger or something [laughter]
sw04351-B_017280-017950 uh but tennis is not quite as extreme and i don't seem to have any uh injuries like that
sw04351-B_019324-019449 right
sw04351-B_019875-020003 right
sw04351-B_021501-021636 uh-huh
sw04351-B_022069-022223 right
sw04351-B_022223-022815 have you noticed any changes since you've started reducing the fat content of your diet
sw04351-B_023571-023697 uh-huh
sw04351-B_023803-023937 right
sw04351-B_026051-026158 huh
sw04351-B_026513-026641 yeah
sw04351-B_027540-027663 yeah
sw04351-B_028030-028162 right
sw04351-B_029016-029209 yeah that's encouraging
sw04352-A_000000-001405 [noise] i'm i'm a student at in college right now so i'm not really in the market for a car i have one though i bought this past summer a used car which i you know hope it will last me for a while um but uh i guess
sw04352-A_001405-001913 it it fits my needs pretty well it's a um a ford uh tempo
sw04352-A_001913-003136 and uh it's sort of you know nice car not not really you know huge and and a tank but uh big enough so that you can fit people in the backseat so you know it's nice when i go places with other people
sw04352-A_003136-003644 uh and uh and there's sort of an ordinary car it seems fairly reliable
sw04352-A_003644-003756 how about you
sw04352-A_004530-004621 oh
sw04352-A_006049-006172 [laughter]
sw04352-A_006602-007183 yeah they're they're pretty nice they're kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah
sw04352-A_007183-007547 [noise] if i- i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might
sw04352-A_007547-007882 [noise] possibly buy something like that um
sw04352-A_007882-008775 but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said [noise] the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a ford explorer
sw04352-A_008775-009679 [noise] and they're kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um
sw04352-A_009679-010782 you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move about twice a year at this point um that kind of th- thing would be very handy um
sw04352-A_010782-011707 but uh yeah i don't again i don't really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my car uh you know the major criteria was that it uh
sw04352-A_011707-012216 you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um
sw04352-A_012216-012724 and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh
sw04352-A_012724-014054 and i- i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and i'm i'm very [laughter] happy with it it's not it's not you know i suppose if i'd the maximum reliability i would've gotten from a japanese car but um they also sell for much more especially used
sw04352-A_014054-014830 and i sort of decided that it probably wasn't worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs
sw04352-A_014830-015536 but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i don't know if that's true uh you know it probably isn't worth it more hm
sw04352-A_015678-016612 no i didn't that's a ford yeah i didn't i mean i- i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh
sw04352-A_016612-017398 that's factored into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay i mean if you're going for like um
sw04352-A_017398-018241 you know say a a you know five year old car um gi- with for given amount of mileage the japanese car'll be
sw04352-A_018241-019148 going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh
sw04352-A_019148-020378 japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something
sw04352-A_020378-020812 and you know people would say well you know i mean they last forever and whatever but i
sw04352-A_020812-021282 i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm
sw04352-A_021282-021436 yeah i mean any
sw04352-A_021541-022897 yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i- i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasn't gonna buy something with you know eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh
sw04352-A_023059-023243 really i'm surprised
sw04352-A_023524-023782 oh okay well that's see yeah that's
sw04352-A_023782-023964 [noise]
sw04352-A_023964-024609 yeah i've heard is it the hondas where you have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something like that
sw04352-A_024609-024761 it's one of the
sw04352-A_025287-025795 did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive
sw04352-A_026302-026415 hm
sw04352-A_026531-026632 okay
sw04352-A_026906-027405 yeah i think yeah i kin- i think i remember it hearing that either the hondas or the toyotas um
sw04352-A_027405-027662 that if the timing belt went
sw04352-A_027662-028870 in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage
sw04352-A_028870-029229 i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing
sw04352-A_029229-029885 um yeah but i- i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's

sw04352-B_005004-005096 [laughter] and i
sw04352-B_005096-006199 and i my friends kept telling me that i could afford a better car but they said but i was happy with my impala so i drove that for about three years till it completely died and then i got the prelude
sw04352-B_006199-006670 and i think if i were to buy another car right now i think i'd buy another prelude i really like it
sw04352-B_006670-006846 [noise]

sw04352-B_018449-018841 you're gonna pay a lot more for it yeah that's what i found
sw04352-B_021026-021695 they don't last forever they they don't last forever they maybe last twenty percent longer or something but still
sw04352-B_022736-023107 yeah and as happy as i am with my honda i have had problems with it
sw04352-B_023107-023914 yeah i mean i haven't had serious problems with it but it's got a hundred thousand miles on it now so i you know i replaced the clutch and timing chain
sw04352-B_024564-025389 i don't know i've heard that with honda with honda's it's pretty natural it's pretty normal to need a new timing belt after i think think seventy seventy thousand miles
sw04352-B_025733-026284 no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while we're in there and i said nah
sw04352-B_026284-026361 [laughter]
sw04352-B_026361-026943 now i wish and i wished i had later because i had to go in and uh i couldn't i couldn't move the car i had to go and replace it

sw04353-B_001045-002151 and we have um three teenage daughters and you know they're very expensive so um [noise] uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um
sw04353-B_002151-002417 it's it's kind of um
sw04353-B_002417-003539 you know it's it's kind of hard to explain we've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts we always had just one and now we're having two
sw04353-B_003539-004006 um it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal
sw04353-B_004006-004481 so i have to be that's that's kind of the way i feel about it you know
sw04353-B_005348-005506 yes
sw04353-B_005506-005819 do you have a two income family or one income
sw04353-B_005819-006024 yeah
sw04353-B_006024-006172 yeah
sw04353-B_007147-007272 um-hum
sw04353-B_007451-007653 yeah yeah
sw04353-B_008209-008373 so your wife
sw04353-B_008373-008518 yes
sw04353-B_008518-009068 is that what her is is her career uh related to to finance or accounting
sw04353-B_009535-009674 oh
sw04353-B_009775-009915 uh-huh
sw04353-B_010089-010429 yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit
sw04353-B_010429-010551 yeah
sw04353-B_012336-012512 yeah
sw04353-B_012512-013070 it's just taking it out right right yeah yeah we do the same thing
sw04353-B_013330-014374 yeah if if you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they'll match it
sw04353-B_014374-015314 um that you know we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess
sw04353-B_015314-015935 but he was with another company before that but we have we have i- i work also but i only have a part time job
sw04353-B_015935-016667 and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food mo- jim gives me a certain amount money
sw04353-B_016667-017525 you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle
sw04353-B_017525-018166 you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house
sw04353-B_018166-018296 so
sw04353-B_018458-018602 yeah
sw04353-B_018834-019419 yeah we well jim has jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down
sw04353-B_019419-020135 um you know i'm given so much mon- money a month so i am supposed to kind of get the food out of that so i try not to you know we don't
sw04353-B_020135-021155 you know i don't ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
sw04353-B_021155-021782 and uh you can b- you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married
sw04353-B_021914-022459 oh yeah so you're just really getting started [laughter] so do you have a family too
sw04353-B_022728-022965 oh yeah yeah
sw04353-B_023137-023385 she hasn't affected your budget yet really
sw04353-B_023385-024533 no no not like she will later on you'll you'll see that because all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
sw04353-B_024533-025652 and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
sw04353-B_025652-026339 and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older
sw04353-B_026339-026599 um but um
sw04353-B_026599-026830 but what do you do do you
sw04353-B_027157-027318 oh okay
sw04353-B_027542-027780 oh well good good
sw04353-B_027780-028887 well we just have yeah we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta i guess we're not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook
sw04353-B_028887-029831 and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much
sw04354-A_000000-000531 what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control
sw04354-A_001227-001556 most and ten being no restrictions at all
sw04354-A_002404-003287 um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it [noise] it seems to me like there's there's
sw04354-A_003287-003973 it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know
sw04354-A_003973-004550 like hand guns and g- uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns
sw04354-A_004550-004713 so
sw04354-A_007090-007351 [laughter]
sw04354-A_007351-007938 and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and
sw04354-A_007938-008495 and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so [laughter] you know
sw04354-A_008495-008649 yeah [noise]
sw04354-A_009832-009971 um-hum
sw04354-A_011465-012013 [laughter] yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh
sw04354-A_012013-012346 i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
sw04354-A_012346-012792 a- and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so
sw04354-A_012792-013896 a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me [noise] i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it
sw04354-A_017077-017214 um-hum
sw04354-A_018206-018392 yeah they don't
sw04354-A_018829-019887 i guess i mean the only thing that i worr- i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it
sw04354-A_019887-020724 is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
sw04354-A_020724-021642 but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway
sw04354-A_021642-022656 so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
sw04354-A_025298-026201 um-hum i think you might've had the i- i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because
sw04354-A_026201-026770 i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh
sw04354-A_026770-027548 if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
sw04354-A_027548-028007 that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
sw04354-A_028007-028246 least i'm not [laughter]
sw04354-A_028527-028672 yeah
sw04354-A_029235-029376 yeah
sw04354-B_000000-000112 [noise]
sw04354-B_000574-000821 uh [noise]
sw04354-B_000821-001312 one being maximum control or minimal control
sw04354-B_001640-002497 [laughter] that well i guess [noise] probably somewhere in the middle i've uh mixed feelings about it
sw04354-B_002497-002657 uh
sw04354-B_002854-002976 yeah
sw04354-B_003805-003971 [noise] right
sw04354-B_004438-004711 yeah yeah [noise]
sw04354-B_004711-006150 well um i ours my families from uh south georgia and you know they hunt quite a bit so i- i really don't you know guns just something that you have [laughter] down there and uh
sw04354-B_006150-006758 uh so i- i tend to agree on that you know but uh
sw04354-B_006758-007205 assault rifles you know that's that's [laughter] made to
sw04354-B_007205-007503 made to kill somebody you know
sw04354-B_007503-007657 uh
sw04354-B_007767-008148 yeah so yeah i feel [noise]
sw04354-B_008148-008552 yeah right or cleaning
sw04354-B_008552-008678 but
sw04354-B_008678-009072 uh i i've heard some
sw04354-B_009072-010249 uh talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something
sw04354-B_010249-011486 and i don't i don't have a problem with that you know i think if you've got a if you've got a [laughter] history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly don't need a
sw04354-B_011486-011654 hand gun
sw04354-B_012277-012435 uh yeah
sw04354-B_012726-012858 right
sw04354-B_013008-013135 yeah
sw04354-B_013910-014507 well [noise] uh i think it it
sw04354-B_014507-015563 i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then
sw04354-B_015563-016116 uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but
sw04354-B_016116-017479 you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i- i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so uh obviously it's not gonna
sw04354-B_017479-018825 uh get rid of all all of your um illegal weapons out there or or dan- you know get dangerous weapons out of people's hands but [noise] uh i think it'd help some
sw04354-B_020670-020800 yeah
sw04354-B_021300-021525 yeah no time
sw04354-B_021525-021685 right
sw04354-B_022331-022458 yeah
sw04354-B_022576-023928 yeah yeah i don't i don't really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but [noise] uh i think
sw04354-B_023928-025363 i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and [laughter] and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to
sw04354-B_026648-026769 yeah
sw04354-B_027457-027687 right yeah
sw04354-B_027882-028094 yeah usually not
sw04354-B_028094-028578 yeah i- i- i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it
sw04354-B_028578-029831 and uh i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and
sw04355-A_000000-000197 [noise] we're all set there um
sw04355-A_000197-000423 have you ever been tested for drugs
sw04355-A_000423-000663 yeah
sw04355-A_000663-001098 yeah i've worked in uh many jobs where it was a requirement to uh
sw04355-A_001098-001320 for the actual position
sw04355-A_001320-001687 i've worked for power plants across the country as a nuclear inspector
sw04355-A_001687-002045 and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug test
sw04355-A_002323-002550 just urine urine tests
sw04355-A_002550-002789 yeah checking for various types of drugs
sw04355-A_003658-003943 um i've heard of that happening
sw04355-A_003943-004477 i've from everything i've experienced the only way they've ever done it is urine tests
sw04355-A_004477-004566 yeah
sw04355-A_004783-004986 i would imagine it probably is
sw04355-A_005599-005893 um-hum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh
sw04355-A_005993-006086 work place
sw04355-A_007531-007725 um-hum
sw04355-A_008614-008702 um-hum
sw04355-A_008909-009230 anything dealing with the safety of the public or
sw04355-A_009454-009650 yeah i feel pretty strong about that too
sw04355-A_009650-010032 it's strange i the last job i had up in
sw04355-A_010032-010470 uh plymouth new hampshire it was for an accounts position
sw04355-A_010470-010941 and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job
sw04355-A_010941-011441 which i thought was rather unusual since i didn't really wasn't effecting the safety of the public at all
sw04355-A_011586-012333 but it i think it shows a growing trend uh in the work place to do drugs testing they don't want people who
sw04355-A_012333-012891 uh basically have that character- characteristic in there or that trait in their character
sw04355-A_013800-013972 wh- excuse me i didn't hear that
sw04355-A_014756-015959 no i don't think so at all we we're uh recently at a little camp out with about fifteen people and w- i'm thirty one but l- a lot of the people that were there
sw04355-A_015959-016359 were in the twenty one to twenty four age group
sw04355-A_016359-017138 and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs because that topic had come up they hadn't even experimented with it
sw04355-A_017138-017494 which i see as a good trend toward the future
sw04355-A_018244-018444 i think in the past there has been
sw04355-A_018444-018795 i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties
sw04355-A_018795-018925 um
sw04355-A_018925-019395 it almost became a a popular thing to j- to experiment and try it
sw04355-A_019395-019708 uh as far as users regular users
sw04355-A_019708-020215 um again it also depends on w- w- what areas you're looking at too
sw04355-A_020389-020684 i think in more in your subur- suburban areas
sw04355-A_020684-020878 i think you see less of it
sw04355-A_020878-021004 um
sw04355-A_021160-021719 and more in the cities uh it's more likely you're more likely to encounter that
sw04355-A_023403-024205 um i think it's not necessarily a losing battle but i don't think it's one you can win i think it's
sw04355-A_024205-024602 it's drugs have been around since the beginning of time just about
sw04355-A_024602-025069 um in one form or another people looking for a way to relax
sw04355-A_025069-025318 um unfortunately
sw04355-A_025318-026448 they're pe- the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs
sw04355-A_026448-027884 or relatively harmless and also our te- our society has become more technical so that the when you use a drug the ramifications of uh si- of uh a side effect harming other people has become more uh frequent
sw04355-A_028196-028838 you know the chance of getting into an automobile now a days and hurting someone being on drugs or in a plane if you're a pilot
sw04355-A_028838-028988 um
sw04355-A_028988-029217 it's pretty uh pretty high
sw04355-A_029217-029669 whereas three hundred years ago [laughter] the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse
sw04355-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04355-B_000051-000185 okay
sw04355-B_000361-000695 uh no i sure haven't huh-uh
sw04355-B_001619-001746 uh-huh
sw04355-B_002073-002359 what kind of test do they do i mean just
sw04355-B_002359-002475 for
sw04355-B_002475-002641 urine tests
sw04355-B_002795-003625 uh have you heard that they can test so far back as say six or seven months whether you've done drugs by uh taking some of your hair
sw04355-B_004376-004547 oh okay
sw04355-B_004547-004764 but is that possible though
sw04355-B_004956-005187 oh okay uh
sw04355-B_005187-005644 hm well no i've never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that
sw04355-B_005899-006057 work place
sw04355-B_006057-006711 uh i don't think it's really necessary it just depends on the type job it is
sw04355-B_006711-007107 if it's a job that's uh dealing with say
sw04355-B_007107-007245 uh
sw04355-B_007245-007589 like a pharmacy job or something like that maybe
sw04355-B_007589-008127 you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that
sw04355-B_008127-008384 but uh as far as just
sw04355-B_008384-008690 yeah every day job i would say no
sw04355-B_008690-008950 just certain categories i would say
sw04355-B_009179-009314 right
sw04355-B_009629-009748 yeah
sw04355-B_010418-010533 um-hum
sw04355-B_010878-010997 really
sw04355-B_011423-011659 hm that is unusual
sw04355-B_012850-012976 um
sw04355-B_012976-013870 but the thing is that do you think at s- some point you know probably about everyone ha- ha- experienced drugs of some type
sw04355-B_013870-014769 do you think that it's possible that uh about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you thi-
sw04355-B_016300-016448 um-hum
sw04355-B_017071-017200 oh that's
sw04355-B_017456-017615 right
sw04355-B_017615-018221 is it a pretty lar- so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right
sw04355-B_018416-018551 oh okay
sw04355-B_018750-018855 uh-huh
sw04355-B_019348-019455 right
sw04355-B_020180-020298 right

sw04355-B_023995-024149 um-hum
sw04355-B_025021-025156 um-hum

sw04355-B_028780-028914 um-hum
sw04355-B_028914-029059 well that's true
sw04355-B_029613-029971 it sure was true uh
sw04356-A_000000-000275 [noise] so have you heard about saturns
sw04356-A_001726-002197 ooh that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that i i'm thinking about
sw04356-A_002197-002759 we might get saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a saturn dealer
sw04356-A_002759-003171 yeah this this offshoot of g._m. [noise]
sw04356-A_003283-003642 and uh supposedly they've got great customer
sw04356-A_003642-003756 [noise]
sw04356-A_003756-004095 satisfaction from what things i've heard
sw04356-A_005374-005556 well like what
sw04356-A_006976-007111 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_008770-008870 yeah
sw04356-A_008979-009709 yeah i've got a sixty five mustang and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself
sw04356-A_009709-010605 and when i look at modern cars and stuff like [vocalized-noise] i just say i will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything
sw04356-A_010706-011166 and it's so complicated too i look at it and i say boy you know i i'd have to almost
sw04356-A_011166-011411 go take a class or something like that
sw04356-A_011588-011717 um-hum
sw04356-A_012841-013009 uh-huh
sw04356-A_013009-013157 yeah
sw04356-A_013157-013309 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_014696-014813 yeah
sw04356-A_015361-015785 yeah that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about actually the car
sw04356-A_015785-016554 one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one ford taurus because they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
sw04356-A_016707-016837 yeah
sw04356-A_017328-017465 uh-huh
sw04356-A_019301-019441 yeah
sw04356-A_019956-020781 ninety yep then or excuse me the ninety two's the ninety two's had dual air bags this newest model you could get them with duals
sw04356-A_020915-021803 yeah but the thing is is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next
sw04356-A_021803-022419 year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things we'd like to get like a [noise]
sw04356-A_022419-023427 [noise] oh i don't know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that
sw04356-A_023427-023566 see if we can
sw04356-A_023765-024255 and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too because they looked really nice
sw04356-A_025041-025936 well the the saturns you can get air bags in them i don't think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that i'm really
sw04356-A_025936-026052 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-A_026052-026586 i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not gonna fall apart that doesn't have problems
sw04356-A_026586-027258 you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the us auto
sw04356-A_027258-027881 makers when you do that because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and
sw04356-A_027881-028760 and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the taurus is one of the highest us cars
sw04356-A_028760-029083 and the other one is are the saturns
sw04356-A_029185-029469 so those two things and then you know
sw04356-A_029576-029841 we kind of want a four door
sw04356-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04356-B_000254-000598 i've heard some about saturns i don't know
sw04356-B_000598-001810 a lot about them i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the japanese cars
sw04356-B_002674-002819 um-hum
sw04356-B_003031-003155 [laughter]
sw04356-B_003155-003300 yeah
sw04356-B_004032-004379 hm yeah i've heard a lot of people like them uh
sw04356-B_004379-004822 yeah i don't know whether whether i would buy saturn or not at this point i'm kind of
sw04356-B_004822-005050 my card and uh
sw04356-B_005050-005377 desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh
sw04356-B_005484-005909 well let's see i like i like cars that are
sw04356-B_005909-006935 designed with with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person whose working on it because i do al- almost all my own maintenance
sw04356-B_006935-007128 and uh
sw04356-B_007128-007860 those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh
sw04356-B_007860-008603 finding a car car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it just not very eas- it's not very
sw04356-B_008603-008852 almost unlikely at this point
sw04356-B_008852-009008 and uh
sw04356-B_009008-009116 [vocalized-noise]
sw04356-B_009227-009374 ooh
sw04356-B_009663-009801 um-hum
sw04356-B_010625-010751 yeah
sw04356-B_011287-011647 [laughter] well i've got an eighty three saab
sw04356-B_011647-012445 and uh i find th- for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on and so uh
sw04356-B_012445-013443 now i'm kind of spoiled i used to have an old uh chevy uh with a three fifty in it and uh i really liked working on it
sw04356-B_013443-013827 ah cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy
sw04356-B_013827-014034 so i'm kind of uh
sw04356-B_014034-014708 biased in that and you know i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
sw04356-B_014812-015315 and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing i'd look at i think another thing i'd look at is safety
sw04356-B_016390-016493 hm
sw04356-B_016493-016788 that's a real nice car i think
sw04356-B_016788-017007 i've driven some uh
sw04356-B_017007-017741 tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips uh as rental cars and i've always been very impressed
sw04356-B_017741-018112 with the tauruses it's a really nice car i think it's very
sw04356-B_018112-018582 it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive
sw04356-B_018582-018724 uh
sw04356-B_018724-019401 reasonable performance and this is out in california [laughter] where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore
sw04356-B_019401-020114 uh i've been real impressed with that y- you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
sw04356-B_020266-020397 um-hum
sw04356-B_020594-020735 well i think that
sw04356-B_020735-021040 that's excellent that's excellent because
sw04356-B_021040-021179 [vocalized-noise]

sw04356-B_023306-023455 sure
sw04356-B_023455-023781 those are yeah that that'd be a good deal to go with
sw04356-B_023964-024100 okay
sw04356-B_024203-025206 um-hum what do you what do you looking for in in those what att- what attracts you to the saturns or or or of course we've already talked you know the taurus is safe but wha- what kind of things are you looking for
sw04356-B_025481-025620 um-hum
sw04356-B_026548-026689 um-hum

sw04356-B_029780-029904 okay
sw04357-A_000000-000565 [noise] hi um the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and
sw04357-A_000565-001344 she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and
sw04357-A_001344-001620 yeah she had to have nurses care
sw04357-A_001620-002684 and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home
sw04357-A_002684-003393 but uh her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an i._v. and things
sw04357-A_003956-004142 oh wow
sw04357-A_004142-004370 oh my goodness
sw04357-A_005050-005190 uh-huh
sw04357-A_005872-006125 and then there's just the grandkids
sw04357-A_006539-006734 oh wow
sw04357-A_007063-007622 yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything
sw04357-A_008061-008517 yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and
sw04357-A_008517-009665 his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed
sw04357-A_009665-010816 and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldn't get up or anything but she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and she never did [laughter]
sw04357-A_010816-011326 oh yeah uh she has osteopor- [vocalized-noise] i don't know how to say it
sw04357-A_011326-012335 anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she
sw04357-A_012335-012881 she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home
sw04357-A_012997-013779 but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night
sw04357-A_013779-013956 and she only
sw04357-A_013956-014565 [laughter] well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming
sw04357-A_014565-015214 and i you know we felt really bad for putting her there and stuff she was unconscious and so
sw04357-A_015214-015580 i don't know a lot of people say she didn't even know she was there but
sw04357-A_015580-015874 still it was nice to be with her and stuff
sw04357-A_016216-017191 well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they can't afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for
sw04357-A_017356-017706 you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just
sw04357-A_017706-018645 taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they can't afford a rest home or whatever
sw04357-A_018645-019044 and that does a double toll on the kids
sw04357-A_019176-019537 i don't know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but
sw04357-A_019643-020014 i don't know how we would afford it either
sw04357-A_020573-020756 uh-huh
sw04357-A_021941-022091 uh-huh

sw04357-A_026925-027370 [laughter] that is a challenge [laughter]
sw04357-A_027370-028746 [laughter] that and you know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i don't know i i would never want to be in a rest home
sw04357-A_028746-028975 i really don't think i'd want to

sw04357-B_019169-019402 [noise]
sw04357-B_019948-020222 i remember one time i was uh
sw04357-B_020222-020601 [laughter] i was in a mexican restaurant here in seattle
sw04357-B_020601-021839 and uh i i was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and i overheard some [noise] folks in the next booth who i think some of them worked at the restaurant they were
sw04357-B_021839-022651 a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i don't know whether they were from mexico or or but they were you know definitely latin american
sw04357-B_022651-023341 they were talking about the differences between uh how uh our country cares for old people and what it was like back home
sw04357-B_023341-023873 and they were just appalled that anybody could [laughter] put somebody in a you know in a rest home
sw04357-B_023873-024744 yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about uh where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families
sw04357-B_024744-025299 where you know the the old people were uh were at home
sw04357-B_025400-025945 yeah and uh most people don't want to live that way today [laughter] in this country [laughter]
sw04357-B_026122-026502 yeah [laughter] god
sw04357-B_026502-027015 yeah i don't know i and i've been single so long i don't even know if i could handle living with a wife
sw04357-B_027015-027202 [laughter]
sw04357-B_027202-027473 i'm probably [vocalized-noise] incorrigible you know
sw04357-B_027473-027546 [laughter]
sw04357-B_028297-028433 yeah
sw04357-B_028736-028896 uh-huh
sw04357-B_029021-029400 well my grandma's in a retirement community now and uh
sw04357-B_029400-029720 seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and
sw04358-A_000000-000432 [noise] okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
sw04358-A_001477-002417 uh-huh [noise] well that's more than we have up here in massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but
sw04358-A_002417-003216 i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
sw04358-A_003765-003882 uh-huh
sw04358-A_005589-006732 i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort
sw04358-A_006732-007491 whether and and i think that and i know massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
sw04358-A_007491-008672 and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that i know of anyways
sw04358-A_008672-009626 where people aren't really you know ecoconscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and i'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
sw04358-A_009626-009947 but uh people need to be more conscious of it
sw04358-A_011712-013038 yeah [noise] no it it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries t- for it to go through
sw04358-A_013038-014093 but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would dr- have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so
sw04358-A_014093-015561 it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing
sw04358-A_015561-015926 and that's the big thing i think that th- they try to promote
sw04358-A_017771-017962 yeah that's a good idea
sw04358-A_017962-018120 yeah
sw04358-A_018222-018909 th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at wh- where i work i work for a defense contractor
sw04358-A_018909-019930 and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage
sw04358-A_019930-020718 because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh
sw04358-A_020718-022052 uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh you know uh uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
sw04358-A_024145-025363 yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa- the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it
sw04358-A_025363-025720 because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh
sw04358-A_025720-026966 [noise] trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
sw04358-A_026966-027378 because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
sw04358-A_027992-028112 yeah
sw04358-A_028878-029007 yeah
sw04358-A_029400-029524 yeah
sw04358-A_029694-029923 okay
sw04358-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04358-B_000442-001467 uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
sw04358-B_003346-004430 well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets
sw04358-B_004430-005621 as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
sw04358-B_009573-009811 right they
sw04358-B_009926-010870 th- here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh
sw04358-B_010870-011808 the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
sw04358-B_015988-016395 right i think here that if they uh
sw04358-B_016395-017469 instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh
sw04358-B_017469-018235 you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
sw04358-B_022114-022894 uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh
sw04358-B_022894-024073 usually have them come from [vocalized-noise] you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual [laughter]
sw04358-B_024073-024244 trash
sw04358-B_027290-028403 well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the
sw04358-B_028403-028928 uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
sw04358-B_028928-029439 now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
sw04359-A_000000-000075 [noise]

sw04359-B_000125-000290 i sure am
sw04359-B_000511-000727 yes i do [laughter]
sw04359-B_000870-001295 uh we're military so we take him to a military day care

sw04359-B_020989-021392 and you know why they keep these people they pay them more

sw04359-B_027648-027830 oh no
sw04359-B_028270-028427 um-hum
sw04359-B_028792-029294 my sister lives in austin and she has the most wonderful home health care
sw04359-B_029294-029856 lady who does this for a living so she has six children that's all she can have by law
sw04359-B_029856-029939 and
sw04360-A_000000-000149 [noise] um
sw04360-A_000296-000534 let's see how about um
sw04360-A_000749-000994 let's see about ten years ago
sw04360-A_000994-001218 um
sw04360-A_001218-001548 what do you think was different ten years ago from now
sw04360-A_002456-002605 um-hum
sw04360-A_004047-004205 uh-huh
sw04360-A_005084-005434 what do you well uh
sw04360-A_005434-005971 actually ten years from today seems rather short
sw04360-A_005971-006098 um
sw04360-A_006200-006535 but i do agree that uh generally it's
sw04360-A_006535-006772 society has sort of
sw04360-A_006772-006976 uh
sw04360-A_006976-007334 let's see rushed everything ahead
sw04360-A_007334-007562 and uh
sw04360-A_007562-008629 i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
sw04360-A_008629-008993 but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
sw04360-A_009544-009683 uh
sw04360-A_010219-010610 hm it depends uh
sw04360-A_010610-010869 it's hard to say because i think
sw04360-A_010869-011210 people were busy ten twenty years ago too
sw04360-A_011210-011386 um
sw04360-A_011662-011790 i just
sw04360-A_012039-012200 i'm twenty eight
sw04360-A_012300-012417 yeah
sw04360-A_012575-012700 yeah
sw04360-A_012808-013410 i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
sw04360-A_013410-014198 and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
sw04360-A_014198-015166 and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
sw04360-A_015962-016293 i think that's part of it too but i do think
sw04360-A_016497-016626 [noise]
sw04360-A_016748-016971 no no i don't
sw04360-A_016971-017420 no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that
sw04360-A_017420-017528 that
sw04360-A_017528-017747 that really do need to work
sw04360-A_017747-018206 i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
sw04360-A_018206-019188 just to [noise] survive and then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
sw04360-A_019188-020309 they think is is surviving [laughter] which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that
sw04360-A_020309-021224 it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
sw04360-A_021603-022447 i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
sw04360-A_022447-023087 is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
sw04360-A_023087-023965 because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
sw04360-A_023965-024298 the uh decreasing um
sw04360-A_024401-024646 middle class in this country
sw04360-A_024646-025043 i think that that's in my opinion the case
sw04360-A_025043-025214 so
sw04360-A_025214-025490 i mean i have met people that
sw04360-A_025490-025798 uh both that [noise]
sw04360-A_025798-026346 that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
sw04360-A_026490-026608 so
sw04360-A_027491-027639 um-hum
sw04360-A_028740-028875 uh-huh
sw04360-A_029499-029617 right
