sw04180-B_000000-000110 [noise]
sw04180-B_000556-001136 well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
sw04180-B_001136-001433 to some extent there is definitely
sw04180-B_001433-002725 you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring
sw04180-B_002725-003354 there there seems to be some prob- you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not
sw04180-B_003354-003937 what i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the irs forms like uh the other day
sw04180-B_003937-004874 i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt
sw04180-B_005138-005416 that that is the interest on the debt
sw04180-B_006081-006207 ourselves
sw04180-B_006327-007657 um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations
sw04180-B_008257-009206 well not not just private but there's you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons
sw04180-B_009206-009494 that are holding that but
sw04180-B_009494-009768 yeah nongovernmental
sw04180-B_009768-010244 yeah you know treasury certificates and us savings bonds and whatever
sw04180-B_011741-013091 right well it's actually uh you also looking at the same form they had that we are borr- the us is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of h- how of whatever it's spending every year
sw04180-B_013499-014680 yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eight- the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay
sw04180-B_014680-015285 you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt
sw04180-B_015285-016657 yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
sw04180-B_017277-018446 that i don't know i don't know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so
sw04180-B_018446-018965 you know except for wartimes that the u. .s has had a peacetime debt
sw04180-B_019493-019610 yeah
sw04180-B_019890-020978 yeah i- i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down
sw04180-B_020978-021764 after world war two it never dropped back down or it was [vocalized-noise] world war two or uh korea i think it never dropped back down
sw04180-B_022599-023182 well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have to have a year to year balanced budget
sw04180-B_023725-024642 yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a
sw04180-B_024642-025401 tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy
sw04180-B_025401-026576 you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i very quickly get in trouble with creditors
sw04180-B_027228-028226 um yeah well that's you know the post wartime germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger
sw04180-B_028226-028627 but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of
sw04180-B_028627-028916 the money we pay in for taxes each year
sw04181-A_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04181-A_000024-000205 i don't think anybody pays too little
sw04181-A_000854-001101 do you get hit up for local taxes there
sw04181-A_002096-002350 oh so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord
sw04181-A_002350-002619 well i- i actually live in new hampshire
sw04181-A_002619-002872 tax free or die uh-huh
sw04181-A_003195-003496 no actually there's no sales tax in new hampshire either
sw04181-A_003496-003934 no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
sw04181-A_003934-004481 the only problem is i work in massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there
sw04181-A_004481-005168 yep but it well you know we i- it's only a state taxes no local we've got a five percent sales tax
sw04181-A_005168-005955 but um the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even though i don't live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
sw04181-A_005955-006152 so that's not too bad
sw04181-A_008895-009979 yeah oh i- i- i mean i- i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun [vocalized-noise]
sw04181-A_009979-010394 right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for f._i._c._a.
sw04181-A_010394-011481 which is taxes where you [vocalized-noise] most people forget about them because you've g- you know you can't always get your f._i._c._a. back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent f._i._c._a. i'm paying forty percent tax
sw04181-A_012203-012741 yeah well i- i mean i think there's some people there y- there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
sw04181-A_012741-013195 you kn- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
sw04181-A_013195-013425 than you're gonna get out of private individuals but
sw04181-A_013425-014233 you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because jesse helms wants it that way or
sw04181-A_014233-014915 you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in
sw04181-A_014915-016041 into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the h._e._w. services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
sw04181-A_016858-017000 you know like we we
sw04181-A_017000-017121 um
sw04181-A_017121-017461 yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like v._a. hospitals
sw04181-A_017461-018199 and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
sw04181-A_019144-019265 [vocalized-noise]
sw04181-A_021234-021554 well be- between between him and reagan yeah
sw04181-A_021554-021751 the great communicator
sw04181-A_022409-022641 oh oh yeah they think
sw04181-A_022641-023064 oh yeah and then they go and say and that con- congress they're the fault for it
sw04181-A_023064-024077 but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in new hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in new hampshire you lose grotten connecticut goes so you know it's like
sw04181-A_024077-024949 you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if those if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
sw04181-A_024949-025400 so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
sw04181-A_025901-026011 yes
sw04181-A_026699-026912 who who aren't contributing right yeah
sw04181-A_027087-027262 and uh in our
sw04181-A_027364-027446 right
sw04181-A_027446-027510 [noise]
sw04181-A_027510-027738 but what's very funny is in our town meeting
sw04181-A_027738-029020 they were vo- th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates new hampshire constitution [noise] for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
sw04181-A_029020-029297 they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this
sw04181-A_029297-029720 course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use
sw04181-A_029821-029863 yeah
sw04181-B_000000-000044 [noise]
sw04181-B_000179-000898 no i would tend to agree very highly i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it
sw04181-B_001016-001403 yeah we sure do here in indiana we pay uh
sw04181-B_001403-002148 we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it
sw04181-B_002297-002435 that's right we
sw04181-B_002561-002695 uh-huh
sw04181-B_002695-003283 right which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
sw04181-B_003403-003650 there's no sales tax either
sw04181-B_003865-004012 uh-huh
sw04181-B_004144-004264 right
sw04181-B_004395-004561 taxachusetts
sw04181-B_004830-004931 uh-huh
sw04181-B_005090-005228 [noise] right
sw04181-B_005514-005638 right
sw04181-B_005866-006032 uh-huh
sw04181-B_006032-006949 no i uh i really think that here in indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh
sw04181-B_006949-007479 last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
sw04181-B_007479-008684 and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that
sw04181-B_008684-008941 that i'm just getting overtaxed
sw04181-B_009631-009800 uh-huh
sw04181-B_009800-010083 no that's that's not any fun
sw04181-B_010336-010478 uh-huh
sw04181-B_010478-010660 right
sw04181-B_010948-011047 right
sw04181-B_011390-012275 yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste
sw04181-B_012689-012816 right
sw04181-B_013144-013286 right
sw04181-B_013797-013942 right
sw04181-B_014073-014347 that's right got to keep those farmers happy
sw04181-B_014690-014829 uh-huh
sw04181-B_015948-017197 right there i- there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs
sw04181-B_018114-018257 right
sw04181-B_018257-019330 and a lot of it's feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole
sw04181-B_019330-020792 it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the bush administration who has increased government and expenditures
sw04181-B_020792-021426 uh be- beyond what any other president since world war two has done and yet he supposedly
sw04181-B_021426-022196 right right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt
sw04181-B_022196-022733 are was created during the reagan bush era who are suppo- supposedly fiscally conservative
sw04181-B_023007-023137 right
sw04181-B_023479-023606 right
sw04181-B_023743-023866 um-hum
sw04181-B_024859-025049 that's right
sw04181-B_025351-025957 yeah it's really that is the especially that defense [vocalized-noise] cuts in the defense is really a catch-22
sw04181-B_025957-026901 double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
sw04181-B_026901-027096 so that's that's really
sw04181-B_027096-027692 it's i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these policies
sw04181-B_028438-028560 uh-huh
sw04181-B_028955-029079 right
sw04181-B_029651-029863 that's right
sw04182-A_000000-000055 [noise]
sw04182-A_000526-000896 correct i- i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers
sw04182-A_009185-009325 right
sw04182-A_009325-010713 well i- i- i- i tend to look at it like uh right i mean without without uh you know a suspicion of of you know reasonable suspicion of of something going on i- i would have to probably tend to uh
sw04182-A_010713-012025 uh agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i- i also my my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for uh something the last i heard was not a hundred percent effective
sw04182-A_012025-013038 or you know accurate uh with it not being a hundred percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive
sw04182-A_013038-013196 uh
sw04182-A_013196-013459 absolutely you know that that
sw04182-A_013560-014019 sure sure because i mean it's like uh someone goes on trial for something
sw04182-A_014019-014441 the press lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted
sw04182-A_014441-015342 but uh so there is that i mean but also you know as as someone who does not use any controlled substances i
sw04182-A_015342-016184 you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal
sw04182-A_016184-016648 uh so th- you know that that is a tough things to juggle between the two
sw04182-A_016648-016787 uh
sw04182-A_023843-024112 [vocalized-noise] it also involves due process
sw04182-A_025982-026708 and and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the uh employer have to
sw04182-A_026708-026935 you know to get information about that
sw04182-A_028919-029147 [laughter]
sw04182-A_029147-029338 [laughter]
sw04182-B_000000-000603 [noise] okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place
sw04182-B_000758-001218 yeah yeah my my gut feeling is to
sw04182-B_001218-002234 probably side uh on the the bill of rights side of this and say that this it's an unfair [vocalized-noise] invasion of privacy i- i um
sw04182-B_002234-002514 it i have to say that i
sw04182-B_002514-002750 m- from my political point of view
sw04182-B_002750-003897 i tend to be i tend to sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of issues but at the same time uh part of my own picture of the way [vocalized-noise] politics should work in this country is there also should be
sw04182-B_003897-005146 uh regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where uh an uh a working individual uh could do damage for instance a an airline pilot
sw04182-B_005146-006055 uh you know or or somebody who's driving a public carrier like like truck drivers and stuff like that i think that there is a uh far more substantial issue
sw04182-B_006055-007533 uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way um people behave um i think a g- for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um
sw04182-B_007533-008700 in in like a clerical environment or a a work environment like i'm a i'm a computer programmer so [noise] if i were indulging in activities like that or one of my colleagues were um
sw04182-B_008700-009165 it would seem to me pretty easy to to tell if their performance was suffering for it
sw04182-B_009165-009398 i don't know how do you feel about these things
sw04182-B_011956-012101 um-hum
sw04182-B_012101-012250 um-hum
sw04182-B_012954-013351 sure sure and that could ruin somebody's life
sw04182-B_013351-013584 even if they were vindicated
sw04182-B_016108-016238 sure
sw04182-B_016567-016692 um-hum
sw04182-B_016793-018072 well i have to say i'm i'm a child of the sixties and uh it it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my friends did and i saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives or not not really
sw04182-B_018072-018844 i don't know i guess i saw a couple of friends ruin their lives an- that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like
sw04182-B_018844-019648 you know most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever
sw04182-B_019648-019874 and and they become adults about it
sw04182-B_019874-020558 and uh i- in fact my attitudes about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country
sw04182-B_020558-021353 uh are are that i think that the government should ad- administrate it in a com- you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a
sw04182-B_021353-022588 a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the
sw04182-B_022588-022969 fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really
sw04182-B_022969-024048 really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's right to privacy and that sort of thing because uh uh you know i mean
sw04182-B_024048-025041 yeah and and uh it it i you know the fact of the matter is is i think that that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to
sw04182-B_025041-026051 have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to im- uh have an impact upon his ability to make a a a living and and you know and and keep his livelihood coming in
sw04182-B_026864-027832 sure an- and and uh and and so you know it's uh i so anyway i guess that we're we're largely in agreement in that uh
sw04182-B_027832-028801 case and uh and in fact i think that uh because you know i mean i it's it's literally i you know i'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been um almost
sw04182-B_028801-029885 jeez man maybe twenty years almost since i last had any of that that sort of stuff uh around me but at the same time i don't think that that necessarily gives me a right to s-
sw04183-A_000000-000100 [noise] okay
sw04183-A_000100-000391 well why did your roommate get a dog
sw04183-A_002219-002435 oh
sw04183-A_002729-002882 oh that's good
sw04183-A_002996-003206 [laughter]
sw04183-A_003206-003408 well is he teething
sw04183-A_003408-003536 yeah
sw04183-A_003819-004668 oh yuck oh yuck well i have a um i have a well i call her my a puppy but she's actually going to ten
sw04183-A_004668-005445 and uh had her all ten years and she she'll rough house with you but she's she's learned very quickly when enough is enough
sw04183-A_005445-006216 but she loves to play and stuff but i don't know she's she's i'm getting ready to i'm fixing to move out in on my own
sw04183-A_006216-007101 and she's going with me and i mean that's i i'm thinking that she's going to be one of my main sources of of companionship in in the beginning
sw04183-A_007628-008004 you mean a [vocalized-noise] as far as protec- house protection
sw04183-A_008104-008450 oh no no no she had a stroke about two years ago she's blind
sw04183-A_008450-008858 so no no she she's strictly the lovable type
sw04183-A_008858-009205 so no she's she's too little to do that
sw04183-A_010308-010744 so this is this is not your first experience with [vocalized-noise] with a dog
sw04183-A_012013-012159 whoa
sw04183-A_012601-012771 oh
sw04183-A_013308-013511 um um

sw04184-A_018649-019513 yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to

sw04184-A_024661-025986 attacking a k- a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
sw04184-A_025986-026175 and you know

sw04184-A_027220-027382 and
sw04184-A_027382-028370 that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was fair- it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadn't
sw04184-A_028471-029334 yeah i they really should've should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though

sw04185-B_015189-015340 uh-huh
sw04185-B_015340-016182 yeah i'm a christian and i know that that god is supposed to be your priority but your family's priority above church work
sw04185-B_016182-016700 is is what i've always believed my dad was chairman of the deacons in our church
sw04185-B_016700-017723 and he put time with the ch- church uh uh the church burned by accident um uh uh the you know when i was real young and we were in the process of building another house
sw04185-B_017723-018522 and my dad put working on the church building uh before working with my mother on the house kind of left it to her
sw04185-B_018522-019492 and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church
sw04185-B_019492-020513 right right and and he had more of a desire to be with with the rest of the church members than he did with us and so that that was definitely a problem
sw04185-B_020513-021817 and uh when when my parents divorced i- i think my mother has had trouble staying in church because um she's just she just knows that there's a lot of hypocrites and um
sw04185-B_021817-022200 that yo- you just have to put that part behind you
sw04185-B_022200-022526 oh sure sure and
sw04185-B_022526-023821 oh sure and not everybody is going to get along but uh yeah that that was definitely a a a problem in our in the marriage and they didn't communicate well at all so
sw04185-B_023821-024852 since they weren't spending time with each other hardly at all you know my dad would come home late from work because he'd visit everyone in the community before he'd come home um

sw04186-B_008563-008834 well we got this uh
sw04186-B_008834-009542 you know the two dogs one's the siberian which is a real mellow thing she looks like a wolf but she's just a big baby
sw04186-B_009874-010061 i had dogs all my life
sw04186-B_010177-010334 i've had uh
sw04186-B_010334-010884 and the siberian was basically there for the taking if i wanted it as a puppy
sw04186-B_010884-011330 so i brought the siberian home and she's just been just great with kids
sw04186-B_011330-011482 a-
sw04186-B_011482-011931 and then my wife wanted a had a cocker when she was younger and
sw04186-B_011931-012518 when she was a kid and she wanted to have a another spaniel type dog
sw04186-B_012518-012659 and
sw04186-B_012659-013401 so we wanted a bigger spaniel because we didn't want a cock- as small as a cocker for the husky to beat up
sw04186-B_013401-013655 but the what
sw04186-B_013655-013818 tooth and nail
sw04186-B_013954-014338 they're not serious except but they're just always at each other

sw04186-B_014945-015087 yeah right
sw04186-B_015087-016227 dogs don't normally fight serious very long because normally one as big as a siberian or as small as a spaniel the spaniel knows its place pretty quickly and that takes care of that
sw04186-B_016375-016973 you know it's normally they're at each other just you know snarling and snapping and rolling and thumbing
sw04186-B_016973-017941 and then when they're but when the siberian's decided that she she's had all that she wants of that hyper spaniel it's it's very clearly stated
sw04186-B_018086-018819 you know there are very clear words spoken in dog and that's the end and the span- and the and the springer goes away
sw04186-B_019621-019740 uh-huh

sw04186-B_025239-025634 uh yeah that's sort of strange for a cat
sw04186-B_027536-027697 you know
sw04186-B_027697-028015 the spaniel is death on crickets
sw04186-B_028127-028222 she'll

sw04187-B_027186-027778 ooh ah uh they were kind of playing a big joke on the world just a second
sw04187-B_027778-027835 [noise]
sw04187-B_028322-028444 okay i'm back
sw04187-B_028444-029125 yeah i never got any instructions with this thing on what you're supposed to do if you get another phone call [laughter] how do they deal with call waiting you know
sw04187-B_029125-029208 [laughter]
sw04187-B_029432-030039 no no no no i mean somebody else calls you know so many people have call waiting these days actually we have a completely separate
sw04188-A_000000-000019 [noise]
sw04188-A_000185-001574 sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that ha- had recycling
sw04188-A_001574-002816 band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away
sw04188-A_002816-004125 and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more
sw04188-A_004125-004769 so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state
sw04188-A_004769-005222 uh was being snubbed in this particular town
sw04188-A_005735-005866 no
sw04188-A_005866-006090 no we don't uh
sw04188-A_006252-006871 as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up
sw04188-A_006871-007611 and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and
sw04188-A_007611-008551 bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge about twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service
sw04188-A_009730-009845 um-hum
sw04188-A_010024-010142 right
sw04188-A_010516-010631 right
sw04188-A_010832-011663 well uh i- it's interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh
sw04188-A_011663-012932 [vocalized-noise] during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh
sw04188-A_012932-013254 i guess they figure that they wouldn't uh
sw04188-A_013254-013577 they wouldn't provide that particular service
sw04188-A_013577-014907 uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the the bottles and the the paper and all of that and uh
sw04188-A_014907-016241 you know i'd had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said well this is a great idea you know i like doing this it's not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me
sw04188-A_016241-016885 what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but it's going to cost you
sw04188-A_016885-017135 so i- i was fairly surprised
sw04188-A_017361-017469 yes
sw04188-A_017650-018021 well i really do like it here uh i
sw04188-A_018131-018252 um-hum
sw04188-A_018734-019113 right i'm a- i'm about uh maybe uh
sw04188-A_019113-019457 quarter of a mile to a half a mile away
sw04188-A_019593-020671 but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that i've noticed is i've seen a few articles in the paper now that uh
sw04188-A_020671-021236 there's more recycled material than people know what to do with
sw04188-A_021236-022417 uh apparently the uh manufacturers the uh glass people the plastics people the paper people aren't using enough of the recyclables
sw04188-A_022417-022565 to uh
sw04188-A_022565-023619 to keep the chain going so there's a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and it's actually
sw04188-A_023860-024540 i don't know i i've seen it a couple of times and i'm i'm i couldn't cite the source [vocalized-noise] right now
sw04188-A_025029-025143 um-hum
sw04188-A_025404-025528 right
sw04188-A_026217-026316 right
sw04188-A_026530-027908 w- it's true we uh in this state don't have a bottle bill and every time it's raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i it's
sw04188-A_027908-029246 i- i really can't see why people would get that upset about it because once it's in place it doesn't seem all that uh that difficult to manage
sw04188-B_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04188-B_000015-000253 okay want to go ahead and start then

sw04188-B_008582-009179 down down here in [vocalized-noise] isn't too much of a tax burden up there but uh down here it's uh
sw04188-B_009179-010077 they have uh the the garbage company picks it up for us and they what we do is we have to separate this stuff you know papers and and plastic materials and glass
sw04188-B_010077-010560 and uh they'll they'll they come by in a separate truck and i guess it's paid for with taxpayer's money
sw04188-B_010560-010840 but up there i guess you guys are saving the tax payers uh
sw04188-B_013535-013759 oh i see yeah
sw04188-B_016832-016938 yeah

sw04190-A_007861-009098 and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i sai- i said i- i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars an-
sw04190-A_009098-010199 he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fi- fingers in the pie too
sw04190-A_010199-010591 and that's it's sort of like trickling down for the overall cost
sw04190-A_010591-010917 and the the doctors
sw04190-A_010917-011062 have

sw04190-A_013030-013359 and so it'll cost you a hundred and two dollars well
sw04190-A_013359-014639 i knew which tooth it was and he knew it was too and all i needed was extract it but he wanted he wanted to make the money so they're they're they're taught that people should have certain services whe- regardless of whether they need them or not

sw04190-A_022995-023812 well what they would do is they would just cancel everybody's insurance and say we're not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance

sw04190-B_004220-004852 and social security as far as helping them in their retirement is not going to be adequate by the time we're
sw04190-B_004852-005019 ready for it
sw04190-B_005019-005461 an- and doctor doctor visits medicine hospitalization
sw04190-B_005461-005789 if they increase at the rate they are now
sw04190-B_005789-005999 there's not going to be anybody that can afford it
sw04190-B_009203-009295 [noise]
sw04190-B_014571-014678 exactly
sw04190-B_014783-014952 and they're making it
sw04190-B_014952-016037 almost impossible for people to go and get well routine care shall we say insurance now won't cover uh wellness visits
sw04190-B_016037-016620 or uh children baby visits your insurance won't cover that anymore
sw04190-B_016620-017412 and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesn't even cover things like that
sw04190-B_017412-017816 and the thing is just like dental hospitalization and dental it's unbelievable
sw04190-B_017816-019906 you can go to the hospital and you'll pay four dollars for a aspirin
sw04190-B_019906-020027 [noise]
sw04190-B_021069-021200 uh-huh
sw04190-B_023759-023882 exactly
sw04190-B_023882-024801 our our group medical plan has increased every year in the past three years uh i work for edward d. jones stockbrokerage
sw04190-B_024801-025004 and it's just every year
sw04190-B_025004-025865 every year is just a little bit more of course our y- our cost um aren't hardly anything compared to people that have to go out and get their own because of the group plan but
sw04190-B_025865-026105 it is the costs have increased every year
sw04190-B_026804-027017 um-hum exactly
sw04190-B_027017-027747 we did start a plan this year there's an insurance company through metropolitan life that has started a flexible plan
sw04190-B_027747-028089 and with that they will take out pre tax dollars
sw04190-B_028089-028818 and build it up and it will cover things that your regular insurance won't eyeglasses uh dentist visits
sw04190-B_028818-029636 uh wellness care prescriptions that are not covered through your insurance and that's the first time i have seen any
sw04190-B_029636-029850 e- effort at all
sw04190-B_029850-029994 to make a change in the
sw04191-A_000000-000272 so do you think we have an immigration problem right now
sw04191-A_001989-002098 um-hum
sw04191-A_004362-004503 um-hum
sw04191-A_004503-005269 well i think i think there's still is a lot of land it's just not particularly desirable land yeah i think i think you know the plains were never completely settled
sw04191-A_005269-005410 uh
sw04191-A_005517-005643 you know
sw04191-A_005643-005946 uh you know i'm i'm sure we i'm i'm i'm sure that you know
sw04191-A_005946-006597 there's plenty of room fo- room for immigrants in north and south dakota but i just don't think that most immigrants want to move to north or south dakota
sw04191-A_008121-008229 um-hum
sw04191-A_008787-009178 yeah i've been hearing about that it seemed like the silliest thing i'd ever heard you know th-
sw04191-A_009178-009270 [vocalized-noise]
sw04191-A_009270-009668 [vocalized-noise] you you can immigrate totally without merit
sw04191-A_009668-009838 but um

sw04191-A_022901-023084 i- it it seems
sw04191-A_023084-023526 you know it seems almost as absurd as a few years ago when um
sw04191-A_023526-024279 and w- uh you know we'd welcome uh refugees from nicaragua for political reasons but you know if they're from el salvador then [laughter]
sw04191-A_024279-024783 then they couldn't be fleeing to for political reasons because you know w- we were friends with that government
sw04191-A_025782-025877 um-hum
sw04191-A_027145-027251 um-hum
sw04191-A_028673-029121 were this skills that you know that are really marketable in our country
sw04191-A_029382-029789 because you know you know of the yeah the the see especially hard to

sw04191-B_000000-000027 [noise]
sw04191-B_000315-001562 well it's hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence
sw04191-B_001562-001802 of uh political
sw04191-B_001802-002029 uh repression
sw04191-B_002029-002185 uh
sw04191-B_002185-002871 the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people
sw04191-B_002871-003709 from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but [vocalized-noise] uh was back in the days when there was a lot of
sw04191-B_003709-004445 a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now
sw04191-B_005214-005365 that's true
sw04191-B_006436-007072 [laughter] that uh that's true the uh
sw04191-B_007072-008178 i- i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble
sw04191-B_008178-008847 uh there was a e- essentially an immigration lottery a few months back
sw04191-B_009175-009266 it
sw04191-B_009608-009725 um-hum
sw04191-B_010161-010302 right
sw04191-B_010302-011434 and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from ireland
sw04191-B_011434-011623 and how
sw04191-B_011623-012187 how a decision like that is made uh oh we don't have enough irish in this country
sw04191-B_012187-013546 just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the irish out or whatever it is i- i don't understand
sw04191-B_013546-014029 how this is all working and i'm not sure the people who are running it understand it either
sw04191-B_014492-014590 [noise]
sw04191-B_014804-015345 that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question
sw04191-B_015345-015723 i don't know that there's
sw04191-B_015723-016213 there's a lot we can do short of either
sw04191-B_016213-017286 uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its
sw04191-B_017286-017941 i- i- it's going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh
sw04191-B_017941-018245 and other problems like that
sw04191-B_018245-018347 uh
sw04191-B_018492-019042 it's interesting to me to see the uh the current administration
sw04191-B_019042-020497 welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment
sw04191-B_020497-020636 uh
sw04191-B_020636-021311 given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in haiti it it's uh
sw04191-B_021311-022427 contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they don't like the uh
sw04191-B_022427-022839 the government the current government that overthrew the democracy
sw04191-B_023150-023254 [noise]
sw04191-B_023936-024040 um-hum

sw04191-B_024725-024834 right
sw04191-B_024935-025813 and i- i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration
sw04191-B_025813-027162 is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes we'll let these people in because uh w- we don't like their government
sw04191-B_027162-027297 uh
sw04191-B_027297-027623 i- i- it's an odd situation
sw04191-B_027623-028737 of course we haven't touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh

sw04192-A_000000-000024 [noise]
sw04192-A_000024-000174 alright what do you think
sw04192-A_003447-003700 right right
sw04192-A_005396-006800 hum okay well um i- i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i- i read one time about um somebody's developed uh a test to look at the emissions from um your car
sw04192-A_006800-007674 you know you know i- i just don't under- i mean everybody's so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that's pulled away from the focus of air pollution
sw04192-A_007674-008998 and we're making all these changes with cars and everything and and and battling to have us built cars versus other countries and we're not looking at [noise] um the air quality that we're producing from our cars
sw04192-A_012100-012450 yeah i- i- i hadn't heard anything about that
sw04192-A_012450-013730 well you know until these older model cars i mean granted i have an older model car [laughter] but i mean some of the some of the really older ones that you know the mufflers falling off you know and they're not quiet up to specs but they're still being driven around
sw04192-A_013730-014676 you know and you can i mean i'd go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them
sw04192-A_014676-015498 you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can't see and smell
sw04192-A_017143-017348 that's right
sw04192-A_021399-021600 that's right
sw04192-A_021600-021750 that's
sw04192-A_021930-022890 well i know in dallas um i'm i- i live pretty close to downtown to dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i'm not leaving here today you know
sw04192-A_022890-023900 and and i mean there's uh there's a place that used to be called concrete city and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead
sw04192-A_023900-024900 and now you know i mean here they've been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they're just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they've done is is wrong
sw04192-A_024900-026024 you know and now we're trying to clean that up but you know we've seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it's had on the atmosphere that we don't know yet
sw04192-A_026024-027155 you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now
sw04192-A_027299-027428 so
sw04192-A_028429-028549 um-hum
sw04192-A_028549-029500 [noise]
sw04192-A_029500-029648 right
sw04192-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04192-B_000099-001078 well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
sw04192-B_001078-002368 and there's just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the united states are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
sw04192-B_002368-003421 and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big uh number
sw04192-B_003549-004299 um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their uh
sw04192-B_004299-005472 air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at los angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
sw04192-B_006426-006577 uh-huh
sw04192-B_006730-006871 right
sw04192-B_007572-007749 uh-huh
sw04192-B_008419-008518 uh-huh
sw04192-B_008874-009300 right and there was j- i just saw today that uh
sw04192-B_009300-010250 president bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh
sw04192-B_010250-011050 is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in michigan
sw04192-B_011050-012148 and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me
sw04192-B_012352-012500 uh-huh
sw04192-B_012922-013077 right
sw04192-B_013369-013499 uh-huh
sw04192-B_013651-013800 right
sw04192-B_014599-014750 uh-huh
sw04192-B_014750-014898 [laughter]
sw04192-B_015398-016175 right exactly uh the another thing i don't know here in the midwest in indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
sw04192-B_016175-017246 and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
sw04192-B_017246-018670 i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
sw04192-B_018670-019524 and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in new york state and in canada and all that
sw04192-B_019524-020250 and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these uh
sw04192-B_020250-021276 sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
sw04192-B_021276-021828 you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of
sw04192-B_021828-021999 bothers me [laughter]
sw04192-B_022300-022449 uh-huh
sw04192-B_022774-022949 yeah

sw04192-B_027048-027196 right
sw04192-B_027300-028518 yeah all and all i think that we really i mean al- if you look at almost any industry it's it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
sw04192-B_028518-029863 and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said e- the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the p-
