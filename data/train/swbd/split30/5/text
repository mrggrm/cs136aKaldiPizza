sw04051-B_000000-000061 [noise]
sw04051-B_000061-001107 yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
sw04051-B_001107-002032 uh [vocalized-noise] uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons
sw04051-B_002032-002947 and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
sw04051-B_003415-004770 right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know che- inexpensive and lots of it
sw04051-B_004770-005899 uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
sw04051-B_006098-006230 so
sw04051-B_006335-007410 well [vocalized-noise] course there's only a a [laughter] tremendous number of a refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers
sw04051-B_007410-008621 both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems
sw04051-B_008621-009222 but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
sw04051-B_009325-009741 and that's got me very con- you know highly concerned that uh
sw04051-B_009741-009881 [noise]
sw04051-B_009881-010131 it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
sw04051-B_010131-011326 undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
sw04051-B_011326-012502 so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh
sw04051-B_012502-013884 have us uh as a an un- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
sw04051-B_014000-014810 because as i say there is a there's a tremen- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
sw04051-B_014810-015314 and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
sw04051-B_015314-015901 and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
sw04051-B_016005-016963 i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
sw04051-B_016963-018445 and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree
sw04051-B_018445-018592 and i mean
sw04051-B_018592-019065 so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh
sw04051-B_019065-020207 uh and that's a pollu- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and
sw04051-B_020207-020810 the those two mixed together with with water and uh [noise] really make a uh make a mess
sw04051-B_021726-021872 um-hum
sw04051-B_022128-022225 right
sw04051-B_022225-022361 well most
sw04051-B_022361-023420 most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
sw04051-B_023420-024318 uh because when you when d- diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
sw04051-B_024318-025174 that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
sw04051-B_025174-025739 because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
sw04051-B_025739-026011 because diesel oil is uh
sw04051-B_026011-026223 is not very volatile
sw04051-B_026323-026862 you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
sw04051-B_026862-027224 diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
sw04051-B_027224-028008 and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
sw04051-B_028008-028637 normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
sw04051-B_028637-029551 as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
sw04051-B_029551-029952 and so if i- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
sw04052-A_000000-000299 [noise] so um do you have children of your own
sw04052-A_000299-000486 uh how old are they
sw04052-A_000768-001303 ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself
sw04052-A_001303-001441 uh
sw04052-A_001561-001693 uh-huh
sw04052-A_001693-002055 uh that certainly is the most straightforward
sw04052-A_002055-002231 yeah
sw04052-A_002231-003038 i do i have uh one son who will be three in may and uh we're expecting another in may
sw04052-A_003198-004001 no not yet al- my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool
sw04052-A_004001-004476 a couple of hours a day for the older one next year
sw04052-A_004476-004659 uh
sw04052-A_004659-005400 just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby
sw04052-A_005400-006280 uh but otherwise i- i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh
sw04052-A_006280-006546 major disadvantages
sw04052-A_007199-007328 um-hum
sw04052-A_007635-007766 um-hum
sw04052-A_008943-009294 [noise] yes that's true that's true uh
sw04052-A_009294-009838 and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age [laughter]
sw04052-A_009952-010623 yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh h- how old are your kids when they started some sort of school
sw04052-A_011247-011373 um-hum
sw04052-A_011585-011744 um
sw04052-A_011744-011910 uh-huh
sw04052-A_012511-012640 uh-huh
sw04052-A_012999-013130 uh-huh
sw04052-A_013130-013282 uh-huh
sw04052-A_013646-014283 yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool
sw04052-A_014283-014948 maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because they would take turns
sw04052-A_014948-015098 um
sw04052-A_015351-015480 uh-huh
sw04052-A_015666-016072 oh so that's quite a spread twenty four to five
sw04052-A_016072-016330 wow that's great
sw04052-A_016654-016826 um
sw04052-A_016826-017600 so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home
sw04052-A_017762-017917 uh-huh
sw04052-A_017917-018195 what kind of what's their relationship like
sw04052-A_018195-018317 uh-huh
sw04052-A_018418-018572 it would be
sw04052-A_018572-018951 very intere- i mean old enough i mean really
sw04052-A_018951-019384 [vocalized-noise] no sibling rivalry there i would expect [laughter]
sw04052-A_019522-019657 uh-huh
sw04052-A_019848-019969 uh-huh
sw04052-A_020318-020739 oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle
sw04052-A_020739-020897 uh
sw04052-A_020897-021156 hold it no that child is
sw04052-A_021156-021424 wait a minute this should be very simple
sw04052-A_021424-021712 that child is your son's nephew
sw04052-A_021712-022346 that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat
sw04052-A_022463-022636 yeah
sw04052-A_022636-023301 uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle [laughter] whose about forty years older
sw04052-A_023301-023441 um
sw04052-A_023666-023834 um
sw04052-A_023834-024028 do you plan to have more children
sw04052-A_024028-024303 [laughter] all said
sw04052-A_024303-024446 um
sw04052-A_024719-025198 oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby
sw04052-A_025470-025632 oh well
sw04052-A_025632-026092 well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care
sw04052-A_026553-026684 uh-huh
sw04052-A_027247-027416 oh it sounds great
sw04052-A_027518-027645 uh-huh
sw04052-A_027849-028252 yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid
sw04052-A_028252-028463 [laughter]
sw04052-A_028463-028632 um
sw04052-A_028632-028898 but it is nice to i mean i- i find it
sw04052-A_028898-029200 it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home
sw04052-A_029200-029587 with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting
sw04052-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04052-B_000211-000339 yes
sw04052-B_000441-000877 they range in age from twenty four down to five
sw04052-B_001167-001656 n- not really my wife has provided the child care up to now
sw04052-B_001925-002131 that's the easiest one
sw04052-B_002131-002328 do you have children
sw04052-B_003021-003279 and have you been into child care
sw04052-B_004394-004501 uh-huh
sw04052-B_005316-005449 right
sw04052-B_006513-007739 well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes
sw04052-B_007739-009019 uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lo- i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids
sw04052-B_009492-010124 me too [laughter] the last thing they need at that age is academics [laughter]
sw04052-B_010632-011338 well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in texas
sw04052-B_011338-011839 and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure
sw04052-B_011839-012053 with the others we've either
sw04052-B_012053-012249 with some friends done a
sw04052-B_012249-012584 a sort of mother's day out kind of thing where they took turns
sw04052-B_012584-013686 a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief
sw04052-B_014241-014358 yeah
sw04052-B_015098-015849 we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know i'm ready for a break [laughter]
sw04052-B_015993-016220 oh we have eight children so
sw04052-B_016220-016728 there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them
sw04052-B_017556-018004 uh she was in college actually when the baby was born
sw04052-B_018116-018311 very good
sw04052-B_018311-018448 oh
sw04052-B_019148-019968 no and she kind of really wanted him [laughter] i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it
sw04052-B_019968-020454 and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is
sw04052-B_021420-021608 my son is a
sw04052-B_021608-021820 yeah right
sw04052-B_022263-022689 well we didn't quite make that but came close so it doesn't
sw04052-B_023044-023207 yeah
sw04052-B_023207-023364 yeah
sw04052-B_023966-024196 no [laughter]
sw04052-B_024312-024787 now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better
sw04052-B_025141-025369 they live about uh
sw04052-B_025369-025722 four hours from here they're in san antonio
sw04052-B_025722-025867 yeah
sw04052-B_026096-026701 uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still
sw04052-B_026701-027330 and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening
sw04052-B_027330-027897 so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it
sw04052-B_028192-028532 a- me too [laughter]
sw04052-B_029505-029795 i don't know what you hear in california but you know there's a lot of [vocalized-noise]
sw04053-A_000000-000319 [noise] do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly
sw04053-A_000319-000645 [laughter] do you uh how often
sw04053-A_000855-000986 well that's good
sw04053-A_000986-001083 that's good
sw04053-A_001227-001391 do you walk very far
sw04053-A_001523-001662 yeah well that's
sw04053-A_001662-001907 that's not bad i mean
sw04053-A_001907-002457 i know um just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um
sw04053-A_002457-003106 i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master
sw04053-A_003106-003549 so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week
sw04053-A_003549-003690 well
sw04053-A_003909-004291 um uh i- i am uh
sw04053-A_004291-005751 uh i did- i have a six month old baby he's my third one and didn't do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so i've been doing it at least for the last
sw04053-A_005751-006035 uh last five six months
sw04053-A_006035-006344 so but before that i did
sw04053-A_006453-006837 uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too
sw04053-A_006837-006954 so
sw04053-A_006954-007077 i [vocalized-noise]
sw04053-A_007378-007536 it's tough
sw04053-A_007536-007697 it is
sw04053-A_009174-009283 um-hum
sw04053-A_010062-010914 [laughter] yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowi- rowing machine because i did that for a while and
sw04053-A_010914-011354 i- i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me
sw04053-A_011354-011842 and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but
sw04053-A_011842-012244 i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe
sw04053-A_012244-012393 maybe for my arms
sw04053-A_012884-012996 um-hum
sw04053-A_013190-013260 yeah
sw04053-A_013514-013630 yeah
sw04053-A_014854-014970 yeah
sw04053-A_015077-015148 [laughter]
sw04053-A_015148-015799 well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise
sw04053-A_016128-016208 yeah
sw04053-A_018367-018483 yeah
sw04053-A_019652-019807 ah
sw04053-A_019807-020444 yeah well i- i run after preschoolers [laughter] at this point so
sw04053-A_020661-020942 [laughter] yeah
sw04053-A_021062-021405 well uh yes and no i mean i don't
sw04053-A_021405-022134 i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel like you know i've i've
sw04053-A_022134-023357 really worked out but i- i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so
sw04053-A_023357-024429 but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it an- i an- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um
sw04053-A_024429-024566 right now i'm
sw04053-A_024566-025317 you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um
sw04053-A_025317-025446 so that's
sw04053-A_025446-026320 you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so
sw04053-A_027056-027726 yeah um i- i'm a member of president's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've
sw04053-A_027726-028713 you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um
sw04053-A_028713-029853 biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and so it's
sw04053-B_000128-000291 [laughter]
sw04053-B_000291-000397 i walk
sw04053-B_000652-000895 uh about every other day
sw04053-B_001000-001070 no
sw04053-B_001070-001237 that's not very much really
sw04053-B_001378-001531 uh a couple miles
sw04053-B_003640-003930 ha- have you done that a long time
sw04053-B_006918-007136 that sounds pretty good you're
sw04053-B_007136-007346 you're better than i am i uh
sw04053-B_007475-007618 [laughter]
sw04053-B_007618-008467 i- i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh [noise]
sw04053-B_008467-008934 uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh
sw04053-B_009049-009688 exercycles but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and
sw04053-B_009688-010153 uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move
sw04053-B_010828-011006 no i didn't like that
sw04053-B_012102-012575 i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the
sw04053-B_012575-012902 the main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable
sw04053-B_012902-013012 and uh
sw04053-B_013012-013570 walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i- i bicycle once in a while
sw04053-B_013570-013879 but if it's any kind of equipment then uh
sw04053-B_014011-014379 i have uh four kids at home and and
sw04053-B_014379-014882 they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings
sw04053-B_014882-015190 and it takes me a while to get back into it so

sw04054-A_000698-001059 first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh
sw04054-A_001059-001686 subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh
sw04054-A_001686-001836 [noise]
sw04054-A_001836-002004 screening uh
sw04054-A_002004-002393 uh screening for potential problems [noise]
sw04054-A_002393-003178 good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh
sw04054-A_003178-004710 well i read an article in the wall street journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the
sw04054-A_004710-005279 the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis
sw04054-A_006931-007065 yeah
sw04054-A_009287-009431 uh-huh
sw04054-A_009752-010686 [noise] yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with
sw04054-A_010686-011801 employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it
sw04054-A_011801-012134 one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh
sw04054-A_012134-012787 [noise] there's they most of them don't test for
sw04054-A_012787-013339 actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse
sw04054-A_013339-013776 and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh
sw04054-A_013887-014744 i- i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country
sw04054-A_014744-015614 so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are of you know are the ones that they focus on
sw04054-A_017617-017709 [noise]
sw04054-A_017709-018495 well see now in texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago

sw04054-B_007305-007633 because we lose so much
sw04054-B_007633-008037 time and what have you with the the drug problem
sw04054-B_008037-008387 and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh
sw04054-B_008532-009041 i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh
sw04054-B_009041-009358 have some kind of guidelines to go by
sw04054-B_009358-009773 but like anything else this can be misused
sw04054-B_011722-011860 uh-huh
sw04054-B_013233-013400 [noise] right
sw04054-B_014713-014835 [noise]
sw04054-B_015551-016013 [noise] well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is
sw04054-B_016013-016924 more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more
sw04054-B_016924-017763 harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh
sw04054-B_018454-019450 yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again
sw04054-B_019450-020576 this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two dwi's
sw04054-B_020576-021073 and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone
sw04054-B_021073-022351 and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh
sw04054-B_022811-023034 the good old [noise]
sw04054-B_023435-024189 yeah good old boy stuff [laughter] you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect [laughter]

sw04054-B_025597-026127 and it's acc- it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not
sw04054-B_026127-026967 they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before and i'm afraid that's what we may be
sw04054-B_026967-027338 facing in the very near future
sw04054-B_027629-028723 other than that i don't know because i don't drink and i don't do drugs [laughter] and it's uh so neither is really acceptable to me [laughter]

sw04055-B_009563-009670 um-hum
sw04055-B_010800-010926 great
sw04055-B_011162-011929 what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves
sw04055-B_012894-013021 um-hum
sw04055-B_014272-014681 uh-huh o- course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah
sw04055-B_014681-014944 it doesn't get very cold in texas
sw04055-B_014944-015251 so lots of times we don't even take tents
sw04055-B_015251-015489 we just use trail tarps
sw04055-B_015696-016188 uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of
sw04055-B_016188-016637 uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
sw04055-B_016637-017262 uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
sw04055-B_017262-017979 so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and
sw04055-B_017979-018225 they'll keep you dry or whatever
sw04055-B_020098-020202 um-hum
sw04055-B_021351-021917 ye- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
sw04055-B_021917-022328 uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere
sw04055-B_022328-023382 uh [laughter] so uh but it [vocalized-noise] even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with boy scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting
sw04055-B_023382-023606 but we got to see a lot of deer
sw04055-B_023606-025014 um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
sw04055-B_025014-025434 because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is
sw04055-B_025657-025790 um-hum
sw04055-B_025790-026197 and possums and uh raccoons
sw04055-B_026197-026666 and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh
sw04055-B_026666-027000 they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack
sw04055-B_027149-027555 and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
sw04055-B_027952-028230 they will if you attack them
sw04055-B_028230-028481 but most time they run away from you
sw04055-B_028481-028798 if y- if they s- if they see you're up you know
sw04055-B_028798-029149 [noise] but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep
sw04055-B_029314-029430 so
sw04055-B_029430-029529 [noise]
sw04056-A_000000-000025 [noise]
sw04056-A_000025-000200 okay should begin
sw04056-A_000200-000319 uh
sw04056-A_000319-000705 i can begin this um basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis
sw04056-A_000705-001616 and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical
sw04056-A_001616-002341 uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself
sw04056-A_002341-002550 um what's your situation
sw04056-A_002689-002799 oh
sw04056-A_003918-004050 um-hum
sw04056-A_004050-004241 are you a professor there
sw04056-A_005048-005298 oh i see okay
sw04056-A_006301-006547 oh no doubt [laughter]
sw04056-A_007370-007967 right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is uh
sw04056-A_008069-008471 i used to work with the army research institute and being a uh
sw04056-A_008471-008815 a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
sw04056-A_008815-009200 but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year
sw04056-A_009200-010151 so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so
sw04056-A_010151-011158 that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
sw04056-A_011935-012007 um-hum
sw04056-A_012517-012627 yeah
sw04056-A_013500-014515 yeah i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed oregon's plan or the oregon plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
sw04056-A_014515-014993 it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh
sw04056-A_014993-015275 oh all the different uh
sw04056-A_015275-015538 med- medical maladies that you can have
sw04056-A_015538-016538 and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would
sw04056-A_016538-017100 so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck
sw04056-A_017100-017357 but um it [vocalized-noise] was an interesting show
sw04056-A_017357-017716 i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing
sw04056-A_017716-018469 uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be
sw04056-A_018469-018577 um
sw04056-A_018577-019416 just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
sw04056-A_019416-020182 but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh university of new hampshire handle it
sw04056-A_021331-021438 um
sw04056-A_022165-022300 great
sw04056-A_022561-022999 is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh
sw04056-A_022999-023622 professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or
sw04056-A_024663-024780 right
sw04056-A_025017-025114 um-hum
sw04056-A_025634-025721 uh-huh
sw04056-A_026184-026332 oh okay
sw04056-A_026843-026949 right
sw04056-A_027162-027709 yeah i'm kind of interested because i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree
sw04056-A_027709-027963 is to uh is to teach in university
sw04056-A_027963-028215 i'm a doctoral student in florida right now
sw04056-A_028215-028337 but um
sw04056-A_028337-029047 yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
sw04056-A_029565-029726 oh is that right
sw04056-B_000000-000057 [noise]
sw04056-B_000057-000248 okay all right
sw04056-B_000629-000763 uh-huh
sw04056-B_001595-001709 uh-huh
sw04056-B_002260-002405 uh-huh
sw04056-B_002405-002791 i- i work for the university of new hampshire and uh
sw04056-B_002791-003982 our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental
sw04056-B_003982-004176 uh [vocalized-noise]
sw04056-B_004176-005195 no i work in i'm in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i uh effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the university of new hampshire
sw04056-B_005195-005972 uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh
sw04056-B_005972-006429 the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get
sw04056-B_006429-007432 we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off
sw04056-B_007539-007636 yeah
sw04056-B_008757-008894 right
sw04056-B_009156-009274 uh-huh
sw04056-B_010094-010196 um-hum
sw04056-B_011140-011966 well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit
sw04056-B_011966-012511 and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh
sw04056-B_012511-013551 you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part
sw04056-B_014055-014172 uh-huh
sw04056-B_014172-014295 right
sw04056-B_015549-015647 oh yeah
sw04056-B_015918-016022 um-hum
sw04056-B_016498-016599 huh
sw04056-B_017041-017154 uh-huh
sw04056-B_017326-017422 hum
sw04056-B_017659-017787 right
sw04056-B_018790-018907 right
sw04056-B_019374-019496 um-hum
sw04056-B_020128-021365 well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
sw04056-B_021365-022192 but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
sw04056-B_022192-022651 and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
sw04056-B_023510-024199 uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operat- for what we call operating staff which are
sw04056-B_024199-025029 considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p. a. t. staff which i belong to
sw04056-B_025029-025704 and but the main i think the hea- the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but
sw04056-B_025704-026247 the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued
sw04056-B_026247-026870 uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there
sw04056-B_026870-027198 uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get
sw04056-B_027663-027780 um-hum
sw04056-B_027906-028028 uh-huh
sw04056-B_028148-028266 oh
sw04056-B_028943-029630 college programs uh belong to this t. i. a. a. uh c. r. e. f. uh retirement fund
sw04056-B_029630-029917 right and in the case of the university of new hampshire uh
sw04057-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04057-A_000011-000173 all right uh
sw04057-A_000504-000669 excuse me
sw04057-A_000669-000822 yeah
sw04057-A_001251-001411 okay
sw04057-A_001411-001596 all right so uh
sw04057-A_002104-002292 yeah i
sw04057-A_002292-002442 yeah
sw04057-A_002758-003098 oh you think y- that we are paying too much
sw04057-A_003098-003285 in taxes
sw04057-A_003887-004014 um-hum
sw04057-A_004138-004569 yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income
sw04057-A_004721-005183 right a- are you you're a na- you're from uh the united states
sw04057-A_005367-005663 but you worked over there for a couple of year
sw04057-A_006131-006267 yes
sw04057-A_006905-007046 [laughter]
sw04057-A_008883-009489 right you talking about special projects in the u- in the us you mean now
sw04057-A_009489-010712 okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that
sw04057-A_010712-011173 um for what we get we're paying too much i would say
sw04057-A_011405-011889 right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted
sw04057-A_011889-012984 for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh mon- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste
sw04057-A_014317-014632 right right typically um
sw04057-A_014632-014877 you don't get a whole lot [laughter]
sw04057-A_017109-018208 well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents patrick buchanan has a idea that says that
sw04057-A_018208-018823 if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare
sw04057-A_018823-019478 so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system
sw04057-A_019478-019906 you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off
sw04057-A_021513-021659 yes
sw04057-A_021933-022974 well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure
sw04057-A_022974-023125 uh-huh
sw04057-A_023125-023288 yeah
sw04057-A_024691-024819 right
sw04057-A_025140-025260 hm
sw04057-A_025774-025917 yes
sw04057-A_026129-026265 yeah
sw04057-A_026265-026408 um-hum
sw04057-A_026408-027050 yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of atlanta
sw04057-A_027050-028173 and we get taxed t- tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was
sw04057-A_028173-028838 um i pay for a a local hospital uh grady hospital where a lot of
sw04057-A_028838-029191 indigent people are go and get free care
sw04057-A_029191-030048 and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i- i and a lot of other thing-
sw04057-B_000000-000107 [noise]
sw04057-B_000248-000519 did you uh did you have to wait very long
sw04057-B_000519-000775 did you have to wait very long
sw04057-B_000775-001318 oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number
sw04057-B_001318-001425 [laughter]
sw04057-B_001425-001534 they had
sw04057-B_001534-001628 [laughter]
sw04057-B_001628-001985 are americans still paying too much too many taxes
sw04057-B_001985-002422 that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this
sw04057-B_002422-002803 well no [laughter] i mean yes [laughter]
sw04057-B_003141-003579 yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh
sw04057-B_003579-004223 i think we're paying i i i used to live in sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do
sw04057-B_004421-004812 yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is
sw04057-B_005134-005483 yes i i'm from idaho actually
sw04057-B_005483-006209 yeah yeah i wa- so when i was living in sweden i got uh an im- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic
sw04057-B_006209-006970 and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much
sw04057-B_006970-007750 i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um
sw04057-B_007912-008959 things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that
sw04057-B_008959-009148 it
sw04057-B_009294-009407 [noise]
sw04057-B_009407-009585 right
sw04057-B_011085-011499 you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it
sw04057-B_011888-012040 i can go
sw04057-B_013021-013815 yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket
sw04057-B_013815-013947 so
sw04057-B_013947-014381 um it seems very expensive to me for what i get
sw04057-B_014834-016160 no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
sw04057-B_016160-016471 and uh welfare on
sw04057-B_016471-016834 reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on
sw04057-B_016834-017187 and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on
sw04057-B_019959-020101 huh
sw04057-B_020101-020400 don't know if i agree with that or not
sw04057-B_020400-021311 i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason
sw04057-B_021311-021632 although two years that does sound like quite a while
sw04057-B_021632-021876 i don't know what do you think of that one
sw04057-B_022936-023242 he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue
sw04057-B_023242-024362 um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for president bush to uh see if he can
sw04057-B_024362-024754 see if he can uh give the line item veto a try
sw04057-B_024754-025211 and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while
sw04057-B_025211-026123 but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how congress reacts to that
sw04057-B_026123-026365 that'd be quite an exciting battle
sw04057-B_026977-027110 uh-huh
sw04057-B_029131-029263 uh-huh
sw04058-A_000000-000183 [noise] okay toby this is brian white
sw04058-A_000183-000828 and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that um
sw04058-A_000828-001150 if you don't mind uh how do you feel about capital punishment
sw04058-A_001877-001985 okay
sw04058-A_003408-003511 uh-huh
sw04058-A_004939-005048 uh-huh
sw04058-A_005183-005451 and that way it can be a d- a deterrent
sw04058-A_006257-006388 uh-huh
sw04058-A_007042-007165 yeah
sw04058-A_007978-008110 uh-huh
sw04058-A_008450-008620 oh great
sw04058-A_009458-009646 the response yeah
sw04058-A_011400-011532 uh
sw04058-A_012150-012266 yes
sw04058-A_013207-013332 uh-huh
sw04058-A_013681-013881 [laughter]
sw04058-A_014150-014265 uh-huh
sw04058-A_014949-015055 yes
sw04058-A_015440-015563 right
sw04058-A_016250-016388 yes
sw04058-A_016993-018430 right right i tend to agree with you uh i'm kind of uh torn between two items however i i definitely bel- believe in due process that if a person is found guilty
sw04058-A_018430-019191 so that we're not ramrodding a a guilty verdict on them that it's uh up for review in uh the appeal process
sw04058-A_019191-019968 however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that
sw04058-A_019968-021448 there are people that are going to make sure that every t. is crossed every i is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now
sw04058-A_021448-021804 not only in the courts is that costing us
sw04058-A_021804-022716 money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and uh clogging up the courts but also
sw04058-A_022716-022953 when the [vocalized-noise] uh
sw04058-A_022953-024117 the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh
sw04058-A_024117-025203 in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um
sw04058-A_025203-025302 the-
sw04058-A_025302-025640 yeah exactly [laughter] exactly
sw04058-A_025640-026722 and the guy is as sound mind and and so forth he's he's not an idiot uh he wasn't acting i- i don't know you know in that case
sw04058-A_026722-027692 we're we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information
sw04058-A_027692-028449 and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly
sw04058-A_028449-029400 that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels app- of appeal
sw04058-A_029400-029723 uh under cert- certain circumstances
sw04058-A_029723-029917 those circumstances would be
sw04058-B_000000-000059 [noise]
sw04058-B_001149-001935 well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered
sw04058-B_001935-002132 um [noise]
sw04058-B_002132-003556 it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh
sw04058-B_003556-004583 if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a
sw04058-B_004583-005187 a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done
sw04058-B_005447-006894 that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality
sw04058-B_006894-007076 everybody knows he did it
sw04058-B_007076-008485 this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh ex- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be
sw04058-B_008485-009571 and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision
sw04058-B_009571-010082 uh [noise] they did it wrong [laughter] and it was just a very minor
sw04058-B_010082-011412 very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again
sw04058-B_011412-012183 that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me
sw04058-B_012183-012363 and with [noise]
sw04058-B_012363-012674 uh with with it being that way
sw04058-B_012674-013762 it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it
sw04058-B_013762-014174 the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead
sw04058-B_014174-015006 here in georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole
sw04058-B_015006-015504 if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well
sw04058-B_015504-015999 and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder
sw04058-B_015999-016125 uh
sw04058-B_016125-017066 that just shouldn't be so [vocalized-noise] but [vocalized-noise] so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole
sw04058-B_021277-021398 yeah

sw04059-A_000550-000993 and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make
sw04059-A_000993-001368 because boy it really confines the uh the people
sw04059-A_001368-001573 and uh
sw04059-A_001731-002196 usually they don't care for it [noise] and kind of put you on a guilt trip
sw04059-A_002196-002498 but uh have you had any experience with them
sw04059-A_003296-003419 yeah
sw04059-A_004786-004909 yeah

sw04059-A_008317-008634 you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too
sw04059-A_008634-009047 that uh [noise] yeah they may say it's real bad
sw04059-A_009047-009447 uh just because they don't like it in there
sw04059-A_009447-009774 whereas it's you know usually pretty good
sw04059-A_009774-010281 uh [noise] uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh
sw04059-A_010281-010976 oh god [vocalized-noise] entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever
sw04059-A_010976-011108 yeah
sw04059-A_011108-011903 and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it
sw04059-A_011903-012227 because they don't eat that too well
sw04059-A_012344-012536 and uh
sw04059-A_012536-012973 go uh a- you always have to check it for cleanliness too
sw04059-A_012973-013294 well you have to make sure they're clean
sw04059-A_013294-013782 and they just had a incident in uh dallas here
sw04059-A_013782-014058 where the guy's suing the nursing home
sw04059-A_014058-014311 he came in at ten in the morning
sw04059-A_014311-014484 check on his mom
sw04059-A_014591-014815 and she was sick
sw04059-A_014815-015448 and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said wha- is she sick
sw04059-A_015448-015607 we didn't know that
sw04059-A_015607-015847 and here she died two hours later
sw04059-A_015847-015965 yeah
sw04059-A_015965-016279 so you know
sw04059-A_016279-016761 and [noise] w- there's an awful lot of variables in them
sw04059-A_019674-019806 oh
sw04059-A_020331-020692 well i think medicare and medicaid payments are uh
sw04059-A_020692-020955 kind of tightening up on it
sw04059-A_020955-021148 but uh
sw04059-A_021365-021752 you know in some of them some of them try so d- hard
sw04059-A_021752-022172 but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful
sw04059-A_022172-022433 is ever ending
sw04059-A_022433-022624 [noise]
sw04059-A_024363-024656 well it's around the clock care
sw04059-A_024877-025101 yeah an awful lot
sw04059-A_025219-025463 and and gentleness too
sw04059-A_026753-026901 yeah
sw04059-A_028985-029168 costs a bunch
sw04059-A_029168-029467 my mother-in-law is uh eighty two
sw04059-A_029611-029840 and we'd probably put her in the same home that
sw04059-B_000000-000146 [noise] think about what nursing home
sw04059-B_000540-000662 uh-huh
sw04059-B_000915-001051 yeah
sw04059-B_001321-001442 um-hum
sw04059-B_002103-002238 yeah
sw04059-B_002448-003362 well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home
sw04059-B_003362-004202 and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing
sw04059-B_004202-004417 and uh it's uh
sw04059-B_004417-004898 i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh
sw04059-B_004898-005257 and a lot more personal but uh
sw04059-B_005551-006314 no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen
sw04059-B_006314-006850 people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home
sw04059-B_006850-007058 that seems to be
sw04059-B_007058-007215 uh
sw04059-B_007719-007844 yeah
sw04059-B_007997-008116 yeah
sw04059-B_008590-008704 yeah
sw04059-B_009439-009549 yeah
sw04059-B_010602-010731 uh-huh
sw04059-B_010915-011050 well that's good
sw04059-B_011850-011969 yeah
sw04059-B_012161-012277 yeah
sw04059-B_012613-012762 [noise]
sw04059-B_012935-013098 i'm sorry what was that
sw04059-B_013217-013363 oh yeah
sw04059-B_013756-013863 um-hum
sw04059-B_014441-014553 um-hum
sw04059-B_015600-015750 [noise]
sw04059-B_015750-015946 uh oh
sw04059-B_016714-017117 yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh
sw04059-B_017117-017601 i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was
sw04059-B_017702-018535 i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh
sw04059-B_018535-019096 kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was
sw04059-B_019199-020071 it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in atlanta that are closing down [noise] it's
sw04059-B_020071-020328 apparently a shaky business right now
sw04059-B_020901-021033 yeah
sw04059-B_022124-022245 yeah
sw04059-B_022365-022886 yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently
sw04059-B_022886-023384 showing some signs of alzheimer's and uh she'll
sw04059-B_023384-024464 my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so
sw04059-B_024568-024948 yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience
sw04059-B_025184-025294 but
sw04059-B_025443-026015 yeah she [laughter] she's she's pretty good with them though she does a real good job
sw04059-B_026015-026830 and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed
sw04059-B_026830-027048 you know which is good
sw04059-B_027048-027768 so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh
sw04059-B_027768-028064 uh i i don't think i would
sw04059-B_028064-028193 wanna
sw04059-B_028193-028881 turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and [vocalized-noise] i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it
sw04059-B_028881-029003 you know
sw04060-A_000000-000082 [noise]
sw04060-A_000082-000288 okay karen you're [vocalized-noise] you're first
sw04060-A_000994-001132 uh-huh
sw04060-A_001954-002077 okay
sw04060-A_002077-002793 yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh
sw04060-A_002793-003251 there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh
sw04060-A_003251-003885 quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a
sw04060-A_003885-004097 progressive path but
sw04060-A_004097-004267 not being in the
sw04060-A_004267-004713 say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
sw04060-A_004713-004883 uh like
sw04060-A_004883-005022 really [vocalized-noise]
sw04060-A_005542-006196 yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh
sw04060-A_006196-006561 a broader scope for rewarding people for
sw04060-A_006561-006781 uh their performances
sw04060-A_006781-007035 um so that's
sw04060-A_007035-007462 in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution
sw04060-A_007462-007897 uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
sw04060-A_007897-008373 and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
sw04060-A_008373-008639 perhaps somewhat even with the business
sw04060-A_008639-009278 uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are
sw04060-A_009278-009384 one of the
sw04060-A_009384-009797 big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh
sw04060-A_009797-010216 security aspect for long term employment uh
sw04060-A_010928-011096 job security yes
sw04060-A_011998-012064 uh-huh
sw04060-A_012654-013286 yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs
sw04060-A_013286-013843 uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between
sw04060-A_013843-014145 institutions and the corporate world
sw04060-A_014145-014527 in uh institutions are slower to
sw04060-A_014527-015205 react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses
sw04060-A_015205-015448 we need to cut back that's what we do
sw04060-A_015448-015583 but
sw04060-A_015583-015907 yeah and institutionally like here at the university
sw04060-A_015907-016694 oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not [noise] where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which
sw04060-A_017140-017813 well in one s- sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
sw04060-A_017913-018092 so we end
sw04060-A_018454-018632 it's very easy
sw04060-A_019247-019374 yeah
sw04060-A_019795-020144 right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it
sw04060-A_020564-020643 well
sw04060-A_020643-020752 [noise]
sw04060-A_020752-020912 the uh
sw04060-A_020912-021298 uh th- that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess
sw04060-A_021298-021677 uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution
sw04060-A_021677-022056 uh the there is not much incentive for
sw04060-A_022056-022663 innovativeness because the the limitation for reward is is very severe
sw04060-A_022663-023166 but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
sw04060-A_023317-023584 uh i guess in innovation although
sw04060-A_023584-023906 he the you know the more complex your structure
sw04060-A_023906-024294 the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
sw04060-A_024294-024549 but uh i think there is uh
sw04060-A_024734-025351 it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh
sw04060-A_025351-025806 things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts
sw04060-A_026798-026900 right
sw04060-A_027334-027574 yeah you end up being your own person
sw04060-A_027574-027969 and uh if you do your job fine and if
sw04060-A_027969-028337 somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
sw04060-A_028444-028593 you know you really
sw04060-A_029069-029468 yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of
sw04060-A_029468-029877 person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves
sw04060-B_000000-000193 [noise] oh
sw04060-B_000193-000762 okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement
sw04060-B_000762-001074 you know not to get in like in a dead end job
sw04060-B_001074-001195 and plus
sw04060-B_001295-001807 for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental
sw04060-B_001936-002135 they're also important
sw04060-B_003464-003593 um
sw04060-B_004675-004775 um
sw04060-B_004879-005366 are they like we- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh
sw04060-B_005366-005613 j- just very little variation from there
sw04060-B_006710-006846 um-hum
sw04060-B_007849-007972 um-hum
sw04060-B_010121-010799 well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth
sw04060-B_010799-011045 you mean security job security
sw04060-B_011045-011216 um
sw04060-B_011216-011551 that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know
sw04060-B_011551-012081 if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess
sw04060-B_012081-012608 but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
sw04060-B_013188-013314 um-hum
sw04060-B_014102-014247 um-hum
sw04060-B_015387-015648 um-hum and there's no doubt yeah
sw04060-B_016588-017115 expedi- yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most
sw04060-B_017536-017633 oh
sw04060-B_017740-017984 oh see yeah
sw04060-B_017984-018533 yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
sw04060-B_018533-019350 yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
sw04060-B_019350-019837 and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time when those people aren't there anymore
sw04060-B_019961-020089 yeah
sw04060-B_020089-020240 um-hum
sw04060-B_020240-020605 yeah but so what else do you think is important
sw04060-B_022154-022264 um-hum
sw04060-B_022593-022723 um-hum
sw04060-B_024221-024371 um-hum
sw04060-B_025771-026453 i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team
sw04060-B_026453-026872 uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
sw04060-B_026872-027315 probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i thin- you think you're just a number you know
sw04060-B_027511-027632 um-hum
sw04060-B_028324-028452 um-hum
sw04060-B_028452-028972 whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it
sw04060-B_028972-029172 get accomplished you know
sw04060-B_029822-029978 um-hum
sw04062-A_000158-000285 i think
sw04062-A_000508-001007 let's see i di- i didn't hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didn't press it hard enough let's try again
sw04062-A_001007-001090 [noise]
sw04062-A_001219-001301 hum
sw04062-A_001714-002990 right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not uh anyway i did press let me press one once again
sw04062-A_002990-003163 [noise]
sw04062-A_003163-004026 well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um
sw04062-A_004026-004888 i uh use a uh a program on my macintosh which is called dollars and cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh
sw04062-A_005121-005645 oh frisco texas uh gee i don't even know [laughter]
sw04062-A_005645-005845 raleigh north carolina
sw04062-A_006215-006382 [noise]
sw04062-A_006382-006826 i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are
sw04062-A_006826-008233 uh but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a pe- personal accounting program on my macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't
sw04062-A_008233-009489 the case in in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i- i- i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give you more explanation
sw04062-A_009774-010203 okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting
sw04062-A_011166-011283 um-hum
sw04062-A_012000-013204 i found that it was uh y- well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but
sw04062-A_013204-013827 if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year [noise]
sw04062-A_013827-013933 um
sw04062-A_014255-014482 for macintosh yes
sw04062-A_014482-015846 um it's called dollars and cents and actually the leading program is managing your monies by andrew tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up [laughter]
sw04062-A_015846-016029 excuse me
sw04062-A_016029-016598 it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um
sw04062-A_016598-017122 you would make one [vocalized-noise] uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to
sw04062-A_017122-018583 change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just
sw04062-A_018583-019354 yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i never never really used any of them so
sw04062-A_019354-020376 uh i- i- i read since then though that they've redes- rede- uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um
sw04062-A_020376-020984 [noise] so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or
sw04062-A_022304-022413 [vocalized-noise]
sw04062-A_022639-022706 [vocalized-noise]
sw04062-A_023409-023520 right
sw04062-A_024709-024864 um-hum
sw04062-A_024864-025565 uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions
sw04062-A_025565-026713 uh so so i- i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially
sw04062-A_026713-027083 fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time
sw04062-A_027083-027199 and uh

sw04063-A_013382-013498 got to
sw04063-A_013498-013780 maxed out right now but
sw04063-A_013780-014617 we try to put a little away ever- every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and
sw04063-A_014617-015300 we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on
sw04063-A_015401-015558 he's five
sw04063-A_016381-016498 yeah
sw04063-A_016602-016698 yep
sw04063-A_016855-017003 we- that's
sw04063-A_017745-018612 yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones
sw04063-A_018612-018852 uh u. t. a.
sw04063-A_018852-019002 [vocalized-noise] uh
sw04063-A_019103-019307 and you know
sw04063-A_019307-019966 the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff
sw04063-A_019966-020496 for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that
sw04063-A_020496-020851 that adds more to the gas budget
sw04063-A_021052-021198 do what ma'am
sw04063-A_021458-022528 uh no she goes they have a class there every tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year
sw04063-A_022528-022975 uh going to the hospital three times a week so
sw04063-A_024295-024401 yeah
sw04063-A_024401-024522 [laughter]
sw04063-A_025202-025310 um-hum
sw04063-A_026488-026630 [laughter]
sw04063-A_027044-027123 [vocalized-noise]
sw04063-A_027223-027410 yeah yeah i understand
sw04063-A_027410-027725 that's the same problem we fall into you know
sw04063-A_027725-028169 you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know
sw04063-A_028169-028542 be with the kids a little bit during that time and
sw04063-A_028542-028755 kind of a family deal
sw04063-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04063-B_000957-001147 well we
sw04063-B_001147-001296 we try
sw04063-B_001296-002512 it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use
sw04063-B_002512-002905 if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
sw04063-B_002905-004099 but um and then at the end of the year i- i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
sw04063-B_004099-005226 you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
sw04063-B_005226-006035 easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting
sw04063-B_006035-006598 i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
sw04063-B_006869-007016 [laughter]
sw04063-B_007016-007203 do you have kids
sw04063-B_007203-007751 one we don't have any because i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do
sw04063-B_007872-008246 but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
sw04063-B_008246-009134 and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time
sw04063-B_009134-010052 as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four o. one k. pan in a profit sharing
sw04063-B_010052-011000 and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
sw04063-B_011000-011466 because to me that's the only way we're ever going s- to be able to save
sw04063-B_011466-012006 because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
sw04063-B_012884-013017 oh yeah
sw04063-B_013402-013551 that's very hard
sw04063-B_013652-013791 um-hum
sw04063-B_015212-015470 yeah they say how old is he
sw04063-B_015470-015850 he's five they say by the time
sw04063-B_015850-016661 kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college
sw04063-B_016661-016866 and it's just unbelievable
sw04063-B_016866-017750 you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything
sw04063-B_018509-018700 um-hum where is she going
sw04063-B_018801-018902 yeah
sw04063-B_018902-019059 i'm sure it is
sw04063-B_020608-021093 oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals
sw04063-B_021093-021465 has she started doing any of work at the hospitals
sw04063-B_022920-024000 yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an r. n. and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and
sw04063-B_024000-024448 and all the things which was an added expense [noise]
sw04063-B_024448-024986 but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father
sw04063-B_024986-025214 living in a budget was no problem
sw04063-B_025214-026016 it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's
sw04063-B_026016-026865 you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and bef- you know
sw04063-B_026865-027431 parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way
sw04063-B_027608-027770 um-hum
sw04063-B_028131-028300 um-hum
sw04063-B_028497-028693 and it's hard
sw04063-B_028796-029343 and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are [vocalized-noise]
sw04063-B_029343-029598 credit card rates are still
sw04063-B_029598-029939 sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent
sw04064-A_000000-000011 [noise]
sw04064-A_000011-000231 well how do you feel about trial by jury
sw04064-A_000672-000824 in what way
sw04064-A_001861-002046 [laughter]
sw04064-A_002046-002747 [laughter] i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
sw04064-A_002875-003470 um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
sw04064-A_004549-004750 um-hum
sw04064-A_004750-005396 the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be
sw04064-A_005396-005951 uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that
sw04064-A_005951-006979 you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
sw04064-A_007349-007494 um-hum
sw04064-A_007494-007791 i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem
sw04064-A_008023-008150 um-hum
sw04064-A_009374-009499 um-hum
sw04064-A_010928-011052 um-hum
sw04064-A_011864-012107 [laughter]
sw04064-A_012328-012456 um-hum
sw04064-A_013439-013621 um-hum [noise]
sw04064-A_013621-013810 yeah i
sw04064-A_013810-014749 i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sen- the well what i don't like about uh sen- juries doing the sentencing in that
sw04064-A_014749-015486 i think it becomes a lot less th- th- the the same crime gets unequal sentences
sw04064-A_015486-016422 i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know s- s- selecting a jury two two different juries that would
sw04064-A_016422-017010 most of the time come up with the same idea [vocalized-noise] the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
sw04064-A_017010-017109 but
sw04064-A_017109-017451 i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
sw04064-A_017451-017625 in trying to
sw04064-A_017625-018204 gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that
sw04064-A_018204-018512 that measure stick across the board
sw04064-A_018985-019109 um-hum
sw04064-A_019374-019512 um-hum
sw04064-A_020194-020354 um-hum
sw04064-A_020354-020968 of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]
sw04064-A_020968-021115 um-hum
sw04064-A_021437-021501 [noise]
sw04064-A_022073-022200 um-hum
sw04064-A_022502-022817 yeah i agree [laughter]
sw04064-A_023553-023677 um-hum
sw04064-A_023914-024008 um-hum
sw04064-A_024334-025755 oh yeah i- i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cann- they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their c- client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury
sw04064-A_025755-026018 through argument that the
sw04064-A_026018-026182 um-hum
sw04064-A_026909-027041 um-hum
sw04064-A_027219-027347 um-hum
sw04064-A_028446-028613 yeah
sw04064-A_028613-028830 uh
sw04064-A_028830-029856 yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
