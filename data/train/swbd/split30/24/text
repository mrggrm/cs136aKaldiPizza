sw04296-A_000000-000384 [noise] i think i'm probably somewhere around a five on the scale they gave uh
sw04296-A_000384-001295 um i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone
sw04296-A_001295-002053 but i also think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that
sw04296-A_002053-003036 [noise] although you know certainly our government is is very nice now i- it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some so- citizens to have guns if for some reason
sw04296-A_003036-004052 something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well that's a very farfetched and you know sort of
sw04296-A_004052-004592 you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess it's it's
sw04296-A_004592-005181 i think it's i- always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since
sw04296-A_005710-005911 yeah i mean i i
sw04296-A_006250-006808 yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you
sw04296-A_007221-007366 yeah i mean most
sw04296-A_008285-008473 yeah i agree completely
sw04296-A_008578-009006 [laughter] yeah yeah yeah
sw04296-A_009722-009895 yeah yeah
sw04296-A_010629-010794 yeah that's a reasonable
sw04296-A_010956-011217 yeah uh i don't think so
sw04296-A_011217-012277 you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem
sw04296-A_012277-013622 um yeah although i uh one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had uh good enforcement of it it wouldn't matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is anyway
sw04296-A_013622-014607 um and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need uh you know a good method of ensuring that they weren't available there which
sw04296-A_014607-015829 given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that
sw04296-A_015829-015973 yeah
sw04296-A_015973-016568 yeah i mean i don't mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think it's
sw04296-A_016568-017165 something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems
sw04296-A_017165-017434 um yeah
sw04296-A_017434-017677 uh do you do you have any sort of
sw04296-A_017677-018676 you know real real life experience with uh you know either people owning guns or people being uh you know assaulted with uh guns or anything like that
sw04296-A_018676-018818 yeah
sw04296-A_019707-019873 yeah
sw04296-A_020431-020796 yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didn't um
sw04296-A_020796-021708 by the time i came along so we d- we didn't have guns in in our house he left them at uh his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever
sw04296-A_021708-022275 but uh i do uh uh another student who i didn't know personally
sw04296-A_022275-023056 at rice uh but uh it's not that s- that uh [laughter] large a community uh about a week ago
sw04296-A_023056-023865 uh was shot in the head with a gun [noise] yeah um he was you know going home sort of late at night after studying and uh
sw04296-A_023865-024551 you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because
sw04296-A_024551-025449 they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say i'll i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever
sw04296-A_025449-026861 and uh apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of uh relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but uh apparently the other guy for whatever reason uh shot him anyway
sw04296-A_026861-026980 and uh
sw04296-A_026980-028384 thanks to the fact hi- his motorcycle helmet was made out of kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but
sw04296-A_028384-028864 um he didn't even have a concussion or or anything like that
sw04296-A_028864-028995 but uh
sw04296-A_028995-029196 so it's kind of scary
sw04296-A_029196-029505 living at um houston's got a lot of crime
sw04296-B_000000-000071 [noise]
sw04296-B_003721-003839 [laughter]
sw04296-B_005169-005768 well you're right there and uh i just think they should have a little more restriction on who buys guns
sw04296-B_005768-006368 instead of just being able to walk into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period
sw04296-B_006777-006908 exactly
sw04296-B_006908-008342 and i and as far as hunting i'm su- you know this is the same thing and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference
sw04296-B_008342-008940 if your criminal and you need a gun for that night it's g- you know it's going to make you a little bit mad
sw04296-B_008940-009568 but they should you know they should have some kind of restrictions and i think everybody should have to have a permit
sw04296-B_009568-009814 they don't require everybody to have a permit
sw04296-B_009814-010394 and i think they should if you're going to have a gun you need to to you know register it and and
sw04296-B_010394-010697 have a legitimate reason as to why you have it
sw04296-B_010697-011083 and it i i don't even think they do that in texas do they
sw04296-B_011083-011304 i don't think so either
sw04296-B_011470-011602 uh-huh
sw04296-B_012170-012320 um-hum
sw04296-B_013170-013295 [noise]
sw04296-B_013548-013694 that's true
sw04296-B_015499-016108 i know it'd just make it it would make it harder for them to get them but they still could but
sw04296-B_016573-016876 but you're right they're always gonna yeah
sw04296-B_017110-017432 hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them
sw04296-B_018556-019852 no not not really my my daddy was always a hunter so we always had rifles or shotguns or things around the house but you know he was responsible with those and
sw04296-B_019852-020529 um there was never an accident or anything like that and we've never been robbed or mugged or anything like that
sw04296-B_021474-021628 um-hum
sw04296-B_023275-023412 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_024423-024672 my oh my goodness
sw04296-B_026808-026968 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_027512-027715 oh
sw04296-B_027930-028121 oh my goodness
sw04296-B_028655-028817 oh how frightening
sw04296-B_029109-029267 it really is
sw04296-B_029382-029885 but they you know and they have when my sister when she was going to the university of texas she ha-
sw04297-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04297-A_001013-001344 oh really so you do you uh don't
sw04297-A_001344-001643 pay attention to uh primary sources
sw04297-A_001643-001820 like t._v. or
sw04297-A_001927-002062 oh that's interesting
sw04297-A_003064-003217 what about television
sw04297-A_003892-004147 um-hum
sw04297-A_005239-005422 [noise] what about the gulf war
sw04297-A_006245-006369 um
sw04297-A_006537-006683 [noise]
sw04297-A_006683-007715 oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on uh i guess m- mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper
sw04297-A_007715-008053 i don't have a television so that doesn't help
sw04297-A_008053-008198 [noise]
sw04297-A_008198-008322 um
sw04297-A_008733-009519 i get a daily newspaper and um i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they uh
sw04297-A_009519-010951 the television uh actually is good in uh uh particularly when we're you're talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through uh complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not
sw04297-A_010951-011618 than you do through distilled string of words uh in the newspaper but
sw04297-A_011618-012661 actually for indepth information the news- newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights and doesn't really go much indepth
sw04297-A_012661-012950 can't really because they don't have the time
sw04297-A_013136-013263 [noise]
sw04297-A_013515-013702 and when i'm on
sw04297-A_013702-014129 airplanes i will use i will read news news magazines
sw04297-A_014129-014493 uh th- my son likes news magazines but uh
sw04297-A_014493-014649 i
sw04297-A_014649-014943 i guess i just never get around to reading them
sw04297-A_014943-015337 it's sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but
sw04297-A_015594-015725 yeah
sw04297-A_015725-015883 yeah
sw04297-A_015883-016040 sort of of
sw04297-A_016175-016238 [noise]
sw04297-A_016238-016420 sort of a relaxing time
sw04297-A_016783-016915 nope
sw04297-A_017015-017139 nope
sw04297-A_017139-017595 [noise] i think radio is in our house more of a source for music
sw04297-A_017595-017751 in quotes
sw04297-A_017751-018059 i don't i don't listen to the radio but my son does
sw04297-A_018178-018355 of course he's thirteen and
sw04297-A_018456-018808 his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music
sw04297-A_019813-020769 oh yeah well when i'm driving in the car that's right sometimes uh well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into uh traffic problems
sw04297-A_020769-021217 so i will tune in to news uh station
sw04297-A_021217-021606 where they gi- every ten minutes they give traffic information
sw04297-A_021606-021837 and uh
sw04297-A_021837-022224 as a sort of a side effect i get news that way
sw04297-A_023223-024323 well i guess you're right [vocalized-noise] nothing more current than uh uh nothing more current and nothing more news worthy than uh traffic problems if at least not if you're a driver
sw04297-A_024323-024500 [noise]
sw04297-A_024500-024830 so uh i didn't even think about that [laughter]
sw04297-A_024948-025117 [noise]
sw04297-A_025856-026007 um-hum
sw04297-A_026340-027220 well it's a beautiful day here in uh california i'm standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in you're supposed i guess you're supposed to call from different numbers so
sw04297-A_027220-027592 i call from a bunch of uh pay ph- pay phones and whatnot
sw04297-A_027744-028393 so the news the n- the current event news in california is that we had rain yesterday [laughter]
sw04297-A_028393-029286 and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almos- not quite overcast but almost overcast
sw04297-A_029286-029456 and uh
sw04297-A_029456-029706 that's your curr- current event
sw04297-A_029706-029885 news cast from um
sw04297-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04297-B_000047-001244 um i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didn't realize that it happened yesterday
sw04297-B_001585-001845 no not not on a regular basis
sw04297-B_002023-002780 yeah i uh have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i haven't really
sw04297-B_002780-003115 done it as often as i i intended [laughter]
sw04297-B_003186-004090 um i just don't watch much television i'm usually i usually don't get home -til after the evening news is over and i'm usually in bed by the time the late news starts
sw04297-B_004090-005231 but i um i do watch some t._v. and and sometimes there'll be if it's some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the t._v. screen
sw04297-B_005518-005876 um i- i worked with a guy who was in the
sw04297-B_005876-006355 who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to date on what was going on
sw04297-B_006355-006591 how do you keep up on current events
sw04297-B_007980-008093 [laughter]
sw04297-B_008197-008728 do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as you'd like to be
sw04297-B_010926-011052 right
sw04297-B_012287-012403 [noise]
sw04297-B_012867-013289 right right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly
sw04297-B_013372-013528 s- seems
sw04297-B_014914-015107 right
sw04297-B_015344-015468 [laughter]
sw04297-B_015468-015620 is that what you do
sw04297-B_015620-015842 read your newspaper over breakfast and
sw04297-B_016396-016534 well yeah
sw04297-B_016534-016816 um do you listen to the radio much
sw04297-B_017747-017870 yeah
sw04297-B_018712-018847 [laughter]
sw04297-B_018971-019101 um
sw04297-B_019101-019670 yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just they'll have hourly updates on
sw04297-B_019670-019834 some news caps
sw04297-B_020709-020862 uh-huh
sw04297-B_022198-022346 right
sw04297-B_022346-022975 um i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because
sw04297-B_022975-023283 there i guess they qualify as a current event
sw04297-B_023386-023516 [laughter]
sw04297-B_024282-024426 right
sw04297-B_024757-025023 [laughter] i guess um
sw04297-B_025023-025903 i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one
sw04297-B_027125-027285 oh
sw04298-A_000000-000390 [noise] going to talk about clothing and how we dress for work
sw04298-A_000620-000858 [laughter]
sw04298-A_000858-001147 [laughter]
sw04298-A_001147-001294 uh-huh
sw04298-A_001516-002410 well i'm sure that you select different colors everyday and your shoes probably you you ha- you rotate your shoes around
sw04298-A_002733-002875 okay
sw04298-A_002875-003266 like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants
sw04298-A_003325-003443 oh
sw04298-A_003588-003759 okay you just
sw04298-A_004093-004227 [laughter]
sw04298-A_004227-004745 they're gray okay so you don't have to worry about the shoes then
sw04298-A_004861-005010 uh-huh
sw04298-A_005315-005553 well i mean
sw04298-A_005553-006591 i think men look very nice i i think that they're much better off than women are as far as their clothes go because i think um
sw04298-A_006591-006728 i think
sw04298-A_006728-007524 u- uh and it's true that uh you know men are attracted by what they see and of course the women always um
sw04298-A_007524-008460 either she's pleasing her boyfriend or she's pleasing her mate or she is looking for a a husband
sw04298-A_008460-008725 and she of course
sw04298-A_008725-009063 in the work field if she's single she dresses
sw04298-A_009063-009197 you know
sw04298-A_009197-010485 i don't dress for um i dress for myself i always like to look nice i want to look uh professional and so i i make an a big effort to do that
sw04298-A_011696-012405 uh-huh well and there's some that really are on target and then there's some that are kind of way out in left field
sw04298-A_012405-012849 i don't appreciate the real short dresses and uh
sw04298-A_012849-013479 and then to sit sprawl legged i think that's very offensive and um
sw04298-A_013479-013900 i don't know how they feel about it but it surely doesn't
sw04298-A_013900-014365 uh i th- i think even the men uh men are offended by that too
sw04298-A_014365-014785 if it's not you know if you're out in public and you're
sw04298-A_014785-015204 you don't watch how you sit i think that's very um [noise]
sw04298-A_015204-015346 inappropriate
sw04298-A_015346-015645 for uh a lady to act like that
sw04298-A_015819-015954 yes i do
sw04298-A_015954-016248 yes i do i work in an office
sw04298-A_017432-017595 uh-huh
sw04298-A_017961-018192 yeah it's pretty
sw04298-A_018192-019594 there it's pretty much like that where i work i was very offended by one of the young ladies who is a secretary and plus she's a mother by what she wore and it looked like she just ha- and she's
sw04298-A_019594-020520 she's very lean you know it's a very lean girl but she really offended me by her dress i mean it was like she forgot to dress
sw04298-A_020520-020863 it was like she was wearing uh um
sw04298-A_020863-020947 [noise]
sw04298-A_020947-021225 golly how do i want to phrase that it looked
sw04298-A_021225-021540 yes a wet suit you know
sw04298-A_021540-022030 i thought that is not the appropriate attire for an office environment
sw04298-A_022225-023480 i yeah because everybody was turning their heads sure enough [laughter] ev- you know ev- you know you just take a double look and they'll say is that really what she's wearing yeah that's really what she's wearing [laughter]
sw04298-A_023735-024230 oh oh no no no she yeah
sw04298-A_024585-025130 something that you'd wear d- doing the garden maybe uh no it was
sw04298-A_025210-025488 i thought what is this n-
sw04298-A_025488-026223 yes it was it was definitely designed if you could see almost every fold of her body
sw04298-A_026223-026362 so
sw04298-A_026362-026796 i thought that was very offensive and i i made a loud remark about it
sw04298-A_026796-027074 in fact i complained to my supervisor about it
sw04298-A_027180-027373 and he agreed
sw04298-A_027373-027731 and she has never worn it since [laughter]
sw04298-A_027731-028186 but i think you have to take some action like that maybe she
sw04298-A_028186-028384 didn't realize

sw04298-A_028513-028754 how she came across
sw04298-A_028754-029314 some people are oblivious as to what kind of reactions they can cause
sw04298-B_000000-000047 [noise]

sw04298-B_010236-010390 that that
sw04298-B_010390-011400 that that agrees with what most women tell me is that they dress to please themselves and you know who cares what these other people think

sw04298-B_012098-012263 [noise]

sw04299-A_010320-011184 yeah yeah well th- you know technically it shouldn't be difficult to uh modulate the the speed on on a compact disc yeah
sw04299-A_011504-011650 um-hum
sw04299-A_011988-012116 um

sw04299-A_015285-015412 hum-um
sw04299-A_015765-015903 um-hum
sw04299-A_016411-017278 yeah yeah um i guess i'm towards the uh other end of the spectrum um i listen to a lot of uh
sw04299-A_017278-018057 techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music
sw04299-A_018057-018242 um so
sw04299-A_018242-018613 it's kind of the other end of the spectrum for you
sw04299-A_019318-019496 um um-hum
sw04299-A_020019-020174 right right
sw04299-A_020327-020477 right
sw04299-A_020796-020950 um-hum
sw04299-A_020950-021169 yeah they're a very good group
sw04299-A_021341-021478 um-hum
sw04299-A_022323-022636 yeah yeah th- th- [laughter]
sw04299-A_022636-022789 [laughter]
sw04299-A_022789-023745 um that's that's more like bob marley and the whalers um a lot of the other jamaican uh groups i- so it's a strongly jamaican based music
sw04299-A_023745-024234 um but it it's it's interesting too i'm not terribly familiar with with
sw04299-A_024234-025104 reggae itself i know it's influenced a lot of of stuff especially some of the more modern dance stuff they take a lot of the more complicated rhythm structures
sw04299-A_025104-025660 uh from reggae and try to translate that into uh more current hits
sw04299-A_026094-026573 um i've heard of it but i couldn't give you a definition of it
sw04299-A_027757-027914 um-hum
sw04299-A_028079-028323 oh okay okay yeah
sw04299-A_028514-028672 [laughter]
sw04299-A_029353-029523 um-hum
sw04299-A_029523-029760 um-hum yeah
sw04299-B_000000-000131 music huh
sw04299-B_000131-000211 [laughter]
sw04299-B_000355-001139 oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music i've been a part-time disc jockey uh
sw04299-B_001139-001994 work for a a company a little company in virginia that does uh d._j. stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that
sw04299-B_001994-002991 so we've uh [noise] we've had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so it's interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing
sw04299-B_002991-003257 are you involved at all in music or uh
sw04299-B_003526-003705 um-hum hum
sw04299-B_003924-004051 ah
sw04299-B_004349-004487 hum
sw04299-B_004801-004946 yeah
sw04299-B_005054-005242 um-hum right
sw04299-B_005242-005612 yeah it's interesting now there all going to uh cd's now also
sw04299-B_005612-005981 i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh
sw04299-B_005981-006514 in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all a- still on forty fives
sw04299-B_006514-007274 and uh so they're [noise] they're having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh
sw04299-B_007274-008106 the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers and uh
sw04299-B_008106-009091 so now they're wondering how they're going to do that with cd's [laughter] it's going to be a little tougher i- if it ever goes to cd's it's not it hasn't converted over yet but
sw04299-B_009091-009676 i think the only group of folks that who even use forty fives for music anymore
sw04299-B_009676-010392 yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or cd's
sw04299-B_010678-010810 um-hum
sw04299-B_010911-011033 right
sw04299-B_011033-011570 yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed
sw04299-B_011570-012093 uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors
sw04299-B_012093-012371 so uh and uh [noise]
sw04299-B_012371-013200 i found that uh at least at the things i've djed people like music they can dance to [laughter] if you can get them to dance
sw04299-B_013200-014116 it's kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and
sw04299-B_014116-015034 and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow and the
sw04299-B_015034-015847 we're kind of uh into oldies right now in ou- in our family for some reason we're most of what we listen to is oldies
sw04299-B_015847-016601 so [noise] and yourself you you just uh mostly listen then yeah
sw04299-B_016864-017018 hum hum
sw04299-B_017372-017515 um-hum
sw04299-B_017626-017747 hum
sw04299-B_017994-018143 uh-huh
sw04299-B_018143-018298 huh
sw04299-B_018414-018549 yeah
sw04299-B_018549-019168 i've got uh some albums i've picked up that i've kind of recently gotten interested in it's uh
sw04299-B_019168-019420 the uh african music
sw04299-B_019420-020116 uh there's a a group that paul simon has uh featured uh well on his album graceland
sw04299-B_020116-020403 it's called lady smith black membazo
sw04299-B_020403-020862 and they're a uh african uh group that sings a cappella
sw04299-B_020862-021054 and um
sw04299-B_021054-021571 um-hum much of their music is sung in zulu in the zulu language so that's uh
sw04299-B_021571-021957 it's a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the
sw04299-B_021957-022660 i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is [laughter] i'm not quite sure what reggae is actually
sw04299-B_023030-023151 um-hum
sw04299-B_023316-023503 ah ha uh-huh
sw04299-B_023670-023796 hum
sw04299-B_024310-024443 um-hum
sw04299-B_024786-024923 um-hum
sw04299-B_025547-025920 [noise] you ever hear of a musical from called zydeco
sw04299-B_025920-026104 i had never heard of it before
sw04299-B_026305-026458 um-hum
sw04299-B_026458-026793 we had uh what were we doing we were djing a uh
sw04299-B_026924-027440 i think it was a company party and they had gotten a request for some of that
sw04299-B_027440-027818 so i did a little research on it it's uh louisiana
sw04299-B_027818-028152 the uh french uh cajun music
sw04299-B_028152-028613 yeah and that's that's called zydeco i'd never heard of that term before
sw04299-B_028613-029094 and uh and i i was able to listen to a few
sw04299-B_029094-029907 tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different [laughter] cajun type music i'd never actually even heard it be-
sw04300-A_000000-000030 [noise]
sw04300-A_000030-000499 i actually just got back from uh u2 uh last week
sw04300-A_000499-000974 yeah they they started down in the south and then they headed up the coast
sw04300-A_000974-001345 they played well we saw them in wister
sw04300-A_001345-001869 and they played once in wister and once in providence and then saint patrick's day in boston
sw04300-A_002159-002995 yeah um [laughter] the way they rigged things where you had to call an eight hundred number and and you know two ti- two tickets per a person and
sw04300-A_002995-004184 there there where two million call attempts in in an hour to get the tickets so it was like by the time we got through there i mean we had separate seats seats but we lucked out we got a second and a third row seat
sw04300-A_004184-004498 yeah so we were we were pleased
sw04300-A_005157-006119 well i mean it it's more my fiance's tastes um i go more into celtic music um celtic celtic folk uh
sw04300-A_006119-007132 well still i spin and silly wizard uh fair port convention you know kind kind of folk rocky kind of stuff but with a strong celtic element
sw04300-A_007132-008018 uh also tanger- you know all sorts of pseudo new agey stuff tangerine dream and micheal field and and anything semi electronic
sw04300-A_008547-009121 well i i like the harmonies and and and and the sounds of of celtic music and i like like the uh
sw04300-A_009121-010257 um the uh the the uh i'm trying to remember the name of it tin whistle the the the variety of s- tone you can get out and i find the singers tend to be better less screaming and more more uh
sw04300-A_010257-010982 melodic and attention to phrasing and and hitting the notes rather than you know just belting them out
sw04300-A_010982-011567 uh s- you sound like you probably are down in the uh country and western belt there
sw04300-A_012250-012408 oh
sw04300-A_013353-014021 well i i find i prefer delta blues to like you know what a lot of people think the blues are because i find you know kind of the more
sw04300-A_014021-014790 the the more uh conventional as where blues i i find kind of repetitive uh and and unmelodic
sw04300-A_015450-015579 um-hum
sw04300-A_016058-016183 um
sw04300-A_016883-017040 um-hum
sw04300-A_017040-018014 yeah well it it's a ver- it's a very minimalist form because you've got duh duh duh duh or something like that you've got a very simple base line with
sw04300-A_018014-018652 right yeah i think i was singing like my dog [vocalized-noise] yeah
sw04300-A_018652-019836 yeah i mean i i think [vocalized-noise] with that the the quality kind of it it's much more based on you know how much the person can impart i mean i've heard some blues that it's like you you know did not strike me as
sw04300-A_019836-020480 as anything special because it's like yeah okay you know life's been tough to me too and you know there's just so much you can hear of that
sw04300-A_020776-021606 yeah i i mean you know w- i've heard some blues i really liked where you know they're imparting more than just you know i'm yet another guy who got treated bad
sw04300-A_021606-022682 trying think where there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on the actual message being imparted it it cer- it certainly you're not listening to it for its lilting melodies
sw04300-A_023472-023610 well uh
sw04300-A_023610-024810 jazz is is a much more i i i think you've got to be a much more uh spontaneous person to be playing jazz you know you've got a long time to think about that next verse in uh blues
sw04300-A_024810-025288 where as in jazz you know it it just is is moving and um
sw04300-A_025288-025865 right i mean and you've got to be very i mean in many ways jazz and celtic if you ever go to like a [vocalized-noise]
sw04300-A_025865-026308 um it's very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh
sw04300-A_026308-027594 uh you know just a a jam session jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if you're playing a reel or a jig you know that's the basic melody of the jig but people are just going off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played
sw04300-A_027594-027716 [noise]
sw04300-A_027716-027859 right
sw04300-A_028240-028852 um there is to some extent i mean you know [vocalized-noise] there's the basic tune of the jig or the real
sw04300-A_028852-029952 but you know someone will just come in and you know who's going to who's going to you know take lead on this verse who's going to you know it you know i want to uh there's a group called [vocalized-noise] which is an irish
sw04300-B_000000-000075 [noise]
sw04300-B_000234-000370 yes
sw04300-B_000370-000590 they were in atlanta uh recently
sw04300-B_000835-001102 how many shows did they play um
sw04300-B_001264-001387 yes
sw04300-B_001854-002307 i see i see so you yo- just caught one show uh
sw04300-B_002594-002747 yes
sw04300-B_002905-003082 oh i see
sw04300-B_003188-003543 really [laughter]
sw04300-B_003822-003948 yes
sw04300-B_004138-004279 how about that
sw04300-B_004409-005245 yeah yeah um uh so so um specifically um uh that's the sort of music you like
sw04300-B_005416-005539 i see
sw04300-B_005746-005969 really that's interesting
sw04300-B_005969-006213 sort of new age stuff
sw04300-B_006627-006816 yeah i i
sw04300-B_006816-006989 i see
sw04300-B_007132-007262 i see
sw04300-B_007723-007883 yes
sw04300-B_007883-008618 is um so the appeal of that music is the [vocalized-noise] quali- you know the relaxing quality to it
sw04300-B_009528-009673 yes
sw04300-B_010161-010352 melodic uh
sw04300-B_010741-010875 yes
sw04300-B_010875-011113 i see i see
sw04300-B_011252-012636 [vocalized-noise] yeah w- uh well you see um uh down here there is a big you know there's a huge country western influence um particularly what i like um the blues and uh you know various forms of um
sw04300-B_012636-013359 you know of uh um delta blues and uh getting back to um really elemental forms
sw04300-B_014682-015897 well i- um you know i can see that argument but and as far as um the the emotion and the feeling that comes out you know even though it might be uh repetitive um
sw04300-B_015897-017299 the the emotion that comes out of it i really think is a lot of it you know it you know where as the [vocalized-noise] quality of the celtic music seems you know appealing uh the raw power and you know whether
sw04300-B_017299-017469 uh yeah
sw04300-B_017673-017824 uh uh
sw04300-B_017824-018376 just a one four five progression over and over again yeah
sw04300-B_018376-018746 [laughter] yeah yeah
sw04300-B_020189-020356 right
sw04300-B_020356-020894 so uh so so perhaps the connection with it wasn't there uh
sw04300-B_021020-021156 yes
sw04300-B_021522-021660 yes
sw04300-B_022266-022435 right
sw04300-B_022606-023377 right [laughter] right right um i also like jazz and um you know how do you think the two um
sw04300-B_023377-023719 you know complement each other do do ri-
sw04300-B_024280-024459 yes
sw04300-B_024780-024904 right
sw04300-B_025160-025448 and create a flowing in different directions
sw04300-B_025828-025952 yes
sw04300-B_027049-027192 uh-huh
sw04300-B_027534-028388 uh uh never played together and and ne- uh there uh apparently in the celtic is there any set form that um
sw04300-B_028777-028933 yes
sw04301-A_000000-000923 [noise] well allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business
sw04301-A_002364-002490 yeah
sw04301-A_003979-005445 oh i think so too and i think that's ju- about the only thing you can do to to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out periodically limit the terms
sw04301-A_006711-007815 yeah but but the longer they stay i- and i'm [vocalized-noise] assuming we're just talking about washington politicians i don't know that much about the state government i figure it's pretty rotten too [laughter]
sw04301-A_007815-008288 [laughter] i mean even the city council's are a little weird if you look at dallas
sw04301-A_008288-008448 [noise]
sw04301-A_008448-008658 yeah but but
sw04301-A_008658-008879 have you been to washington
sw04301-A_008879-009947 ha- have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the house and the senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room full of no one
sw04301-A_009947-010388 and and it i- [noise] their their posturing their
sw04301-A_010388-010941 i don't know i it it's like their not in the real world or something and maybe that's why they have
sw04301-A_010941-011406 have trouble drawing lines as to what's illegal and what's not
sw04301-A_011763-011909 sure
sw04301-A_012383-012520 yeah
sw04301-A_013277-013400 well
sw04301-A_014060-014909 yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to ha- to live the good life
sw04301-A_014909-015728 i mean if you if you just look at at what goes on in washington those folks don't live the same way i do anyway [laughter]
sw04301-A_015728-016545 it's almost like they're royalty of some sort and i think that's why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too
sw04301-A_018058-018426 yeah but aren't they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year
sw04301-A_019305-019428 that's mo- uh
sw04301-A_019428-019798 that's a lot more than i make [laughter] huh huh
sw04301-A_019798-020108 well run for office [laughter]
sw04301-A_020318-020984 yeah the- i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them
sw04301-A_021255-022023 oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there's not a balanced budget when they can't even handle their own checking accounts
sw04301-A_022023-022177 i don't know
sw04301-A_022985-023173 no probably not
sw04301-A_023320-023684 that's right i they get caught up i think in the
sw04301-A_023684-024391 the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes
sw04301-A_026446-026623 that's true
sw04301-A_026623-027250 that's true i wonder i wonder if ross perot would get elected how he would behave [laughter]
sw04301-A_027250-027358 [laughter]
sw04301-A_027632-027857 i i think he's an honest person
sw04301-A_028072-028588 uh and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else's pockets
sw04301-B_000000-000439 [noise]
sw04301-B_000836-001340 [laughter] i think some of them are dishonest and some of them are probably honest mistakes
sw04301-B_001340-002450 it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account
sw04301-B_002450-003651 but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i think they're under a lot of pressure especially when there's lots of money involved
sw04301-B_003651-004048 and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
sw04301-B_005455-006509 well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can't have them
sw04301-B_006509-006826 which is kind of a hard situation too
sw04301-B_007339-007398 [laughter]
sw04301-B_007650-007928 [laughter]
sw04301-B_008219-008562 [laughter] or a lot weird
sw04301-B_008797-008931 yes
sw04301-B_009852-009984 yeah
sw04301-B_011413-011822 well i mean the other problem is is that they're always up for reelection
sw04301-B_011822-012358 so that they're always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision
sw04301-B_012504-012762 and it it i think that's hard for them
sw04301-B_012762-013152 plus when you you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist
sw04301-B_013344-013756 i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to
sw04301-B_013756-014117 use their influence in not always the most positive ways
sw04301-B_014815-014943 yeah
sw04301-B_015564-015807 no
sw04301-B_016654-017112 uh seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits
sw04301-B_017225-018098 and you know i don't know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen
sw04301-B_018371-019290 well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a sen- a a representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year
sw04301-B_019290-019816 which kind of blew my mind [laughter] ye- yes i'd like to make that much
sw04301-B_019975-020242 uh no thanks
sw04301-B_020993-021369 or rai- they give themselves raises when they're trying to cut government expenses
sw04301-B_021910-022048 yeah
sw04301-B_022048-023011 and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is is is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i'm just convinced you can't legislate common sense
sw04301-B_023011-023287 and that seems to be something that a lot of them are missing
sw04301-B_024349-025079 and i think part of the other problem is is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it
sw04301-B_025079-025328 tend to avoid it
sw04301-B_025328-025615 because of all the negative uh
sw04301-B_025615-026274 feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don't want
sw04301-B_026274-026502 to be associated with that kind of thing
sw04301-B_027190-027750 [laughter] i don't know little nervous about that one too
sw04301-B_027750-028066 yeah i think he definitely is
sw04301-B_028066-028206 i don't
sw04301-B_028617-029577 i'm just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he can't just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out
sw04301-B_029577-029840 and i'm not sure as a president you could ever run it that
sw04302-A_000000-000056 [noise]
sw04302-A_000179-000377 okay i guess they're
sw04302-A_000565-000760 okay um
sw04302-A_000845-001065 i guess i um
sw04302-A_001065-001371 haven't really thought about it for a while i guess um
sw04302-A_001371-001779 the uh job part of the one i have now there is a
sw04302-A_001779-002596 requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh companies they contract with required it and uh
sw04302-A_002596-003116 you know by then it was it was kind of uh um
sw04302-A_003116-003940 you know they didn't explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with
sw04302-A_003940-004322 uh but it's it's not something i
sw04302-A_004322-005123 think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that
sw04302-A_005123-005394 but um it should
sw04302-A_005394-005640 i- it seems like uh
sw04302-A_005772-006052 i guess the employer uh
sw04302-A_006052-006181 is just
sw04302-A_006181-006568 i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
sw04302-A_006734-006935 uh kind of your personal life
sw04302-A_008265-008391 uh-huh
sw04302-A_008776-008891 right
sw04302-A_009276-009416 uh-huh
sw04302-A_010251-010389 yeah
sw04302-A_011211-011354 uh-huh
sw04302-A_013099-013232 um
sw04302-A_013680-013804 right
sw04302-A_014186-014316 right
sw04302-A_014608-014988 yeah i know think most impairments would be ob- fairly obvious you know but
sw04302-A_015780-015916 right
sw04302-A_016242-016382 um-hum
sw04302-A_017778-017904 uh
sw04302-A_018248-018381 wow
sw04302-A_019267-019395 yeah
sw04302-A_020515-020641 yeah
sw04302-A_021950-022077 um-hum
sw04302-A_022694-023240 yeah [noise] seems like it's a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would
sw04302-A_023240-023429 done it and they they
sw04302-A_023429-023655 you know the climate would be different then
sw04302-A_025176-025296 uh-huh
sw04302-A_025703-025842 right
sw04302-A_026756-026889 yeah
sw04302-A_027481-027774 uh-huh yeah
sw04302-A_027774-028235 yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um
sw04302-A_028364-028823 i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know
sw04302-A_028823-029152 it might be that they the carr- the carrier they're using has a
sw04302-A_029152-029620 has higher rates or something like that so there's there's probably an economic argument
sw04302-A_029620-029744 [vocalized-noise]
sw04302-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04302-B_000232-000383 okay
sw04302-B_000383-000691 so uh you go first yeah
sw04302-B_003881-004031 uh-huh
sw04302-B_004031-004181 [noise]
sw04302-B_005031-005144 um-hum
sw04302-B_006864-008453 right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and
sw04302-B_008453-009453 um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect some- an employee's performance
sw04302-B_009453-010299 there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day
sw04302-B_010299-010746 and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also
sw04302-B_010746-011357 you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i me- i i
sw04302-B_011357-012164 uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically
sw04302-B_012164-013126 um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it
sw04302-B_013126-013939 but the thing is it's not it's not my company's business what i do on the weekends or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover
sw04302-B_013939-014744 then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well
sw04302-B_014888-015665 yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then i'm fine the next morning
sw04302-B_015665-015840 it's none of their business
sw04302-B_015840-016567 you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever um
sw04302-B_016567-017797 and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails
sw04302-B_017797-018312 that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous
sw04302-B_018312-019576 you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
sw04302-B_019576-019674 um
sw04302-B_019674-020555 also especially it's unfair when the companies don't offer some sort of treatment program also it you know it's like oh we find you with drugs so huh you're gone
sw04302-B_020555-020712 get out of here
sw04302-B_020712-022079 um luckily my company is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything i- it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um
sw04302-B_022079-022551 and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees um
sw04302-B_022551-022740 but i you know i
sw04302-B_022980-023200 yeah yeah
sw04302-B_023350-023575 right yeah it it'll be
sw04302-B_023575-023697 yeah
sw04302-B_023697-024014 and i i you know i don't think the companies have any
sw04302-B_024014-024284 cause to do that sort of thing
sw04302-B_024284-024745 unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in
sw04302-B_024745-025375 obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here
sw04302-B_025375-025886 then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's
sw04302-B_025886-026807 you know th- th- there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance
sw04302-B_026807-027685 you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense
sw04302-B_027685-027931 so it's
sw04302-B_027931-028083 yeah
sw04302-B_028769-029028 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04302-B_029335-029532 right well
sw04302-B_029532-029869 i- i- i- in that case charge the employees extra
sw04303-A_000000-000408 [noise] well um as far as the as far as spending goes
sw04303-A_000408-001673 the way um the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think us ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are
sw04303-A_001673-002733 because i know the article i read stated that texas had um what was it like eleven mi- not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand
sw04303-A_002733-003263 offered to it or more than that and it didn't take advantage of all the money that it was offered
sw04303-A_003263-003732 because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in aids cases
sw04303-A_003732-004075 and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided
sw04303-A_004544-005486 well there's w- well we have we have our o- you know that we have i guess a fair share um and it's it's
sw04303-A_005486-005903 spreading outside of of the homosexual community
sw04303-A_007200-007332 uh-huh
sw04303-A_008852-009172 um-hum um-hum um-hum
sw04303-A_009731-009880 um-hum
sw04303-A_010240-010441 well also because it's so new
sw04303-A_010441-011049 and can- and cancer and such doesn't spread as readily to other people as it does as aids does
sw04303-A_012041-012167 um-hum
sw04303-A_012284-012420 um-hum
sw04303-A_013955-014094 [laughter]
sw04303-A_015444-015594 um-hum
sw04303-A_015594-015745 um-hum
sw04303-A_016992-017131 um-hum
sw04303-A_017510-017645 um-hum
sw04303-A_019794-019927 that's true
sw04303-A_019927-020132 i hadn't i hadn't thought about that
sw04303-A_022156-022282 um-hum
sw04303-A_023064-023497 well um i i think
sw04303-A_023497-024743 a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a a an a totally new experience we haven't come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where we've come across a disease that has spread this rapidly
sw04303-A_024743-025706 um and that we've you know is is changing i know just in the last three months the c._d._c. has come back and redefined aids
sw04303-A_025706-026299 you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding
sw04303-A_026299-027401 and we kee- you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be h._i._v. positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now
sw04303-A_027401-027629 yeah you know
sw04303-A_028023-028170 um-hum
sw04303-A_029444-029572 um-hum
sw04303-B_000000-000063 [noise]
sw04303-B_002707-002838 um-hum
sw04303-B_003210-003331 um-hum
sw04303-B_004033-004546 i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in texas
sw04303-B_005823-005979 interesting
sw04303-B_005979-007326 yeah and atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the centers for disease control is located here
sw04303-B_007326-007843 uh my feeling on the funding issue is uh
sw04303-B_007843-008496 uh p- in proportion to the number of people who are dying of aids
sw04303-B_008496-009134 uh compared to uh other diseases like cancer and heart disease
sw04303-B_009134-009796 we're spending many many times more on aids research than we are for these other diseases
sw04303-B_009796-010366 and i think a lot of it's just due to political clout and pressure
sw04303-B_010366-010570 yeah
sw04303-B_011128-012346 that well yes that's true but also uh we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways aids is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes
sw04303-B_012346-013786 i do think that uh part of the reason that we haven't made as much progress in aids research and the reason we're spending so much money on it is that it's almost all of the research is in the hands of the government
sw04303-B_013786-014532 and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh
sw04303-B_014532-015703 if all the internal bickering between in center for disease control and the national institutes of health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside
sw04303-B_015703-016576 and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find uh
sw04303-B_016576-017591 a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that we'd find a cure really quick
sw04303-B_017591-018228 uh but as it is it's just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats
sw04303-B_018228-018574 uh and it's real disappointing uh
sw04303-B_018574-019749 you know so many of the other uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance
sw04303-B_020194-020320 uh
sw04303-B_020320-021207 course you know i'm a big advocate of the free market anyway and uh it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in
sw04303-B_021207-021408 just just goes to pot
sw04303-B_021408-021609 uh but
sw04303-B_021747-021871 uh i
sw04303-B_021871-022192 uh i do want there to be a cure
sw04303-B_022192-022337 uh
sw04303-B_022337-022477 uh
sw04303-B_022477-023097 but like so many other things i think the w- just the way that we're going about it is not the best way
sw04303-B_025654-025804 sure
sw04303-B_027334-027533 uh it's a long time
sw04303-B_027533-028263 and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are h._i._v. positive but who never get the disease
sw04303-B_028263-029295 and it seems to me that it's it's likely that there's some other uh it's not just the virus that causes it but it's something else in your body that the virus triggers
sw04303-B_029295-029824 uh that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other trigg-
sw04304-A_000000-000195 [noise] well um [noise]
sw04304-A_000195-000600 i guess the first question is uh what um
sw04304-A_000600-000868 wh- do do you have any children at all to begin with
sw04304-A_002330-002484 pediatrics
sw04304-A_002953-003127 i
sw04304-A_003716-004100 oh are you um what are you a nurse are you a doctor uh
sw04304-A_004100-004319 is an attendant a physicians assistant
sw04304-A_004319-004484 i see so
sw04304-A_004484-005228 i've no well i mean there's all kinds of things i haven't heard of so i i haven't heard of that no not particularly what what do you do exactly
sw04304-A_005973-006094 yeah
sw04304-A_008163-008381 um-hum hum hum
sw04304-A_008381-008552 oh boy
sw04304-A_008939-009368 no i do not none that i'm aware of anyway as they say um
sw04304-A_009519-010233 [noise] no i uh no i do not have have any children i'm very i'm mostly happily single
sw04304-A_010233-010379 uh
sw04304-A_010691-010934 yeah i i it is i i um
sw04304-A_010934-011287 uh i don't know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject it's kind of
sw04304-A_011287-012119 for me this particular question is is is uh reminiscent of uh answer yes or no have you stopped beating your wife
sw04304-A_012119-013397 uh um it pre supposes something that isn't necessarily that isn't necessarily true first of all that you think that child care should be done by other people besides the people having the kids
sw04304-A_013397-014075 but um i'm i'm a little li- i don't know i've i've got my own views on that i
sw04304-A_014075-014298 well uh
sw04304-A_014620-014796 hey there you go
sw04304-A_014796-015382 um i don't know i i tend to think that child care is kind of overused i think there's a
sw04304-A_015382-016566 kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over
sw04304-A_016566-017030 over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense
sw04304-A_017161-018162 that's the reason one of the reasons i think that schools are doing so badly is so many people look at them as a just a just a tax payer financed babysitting service
sw04304-A_018162-018491 you know but anyway that's just me [laughter]
sw04304-A_020447-020573 [noise]
sw04304-A_021380-021520 yeah
sw04304-A_022197-022431 there's a good phrase [laughter]
sw04304-A_023730-023908 um-hum [noise]
sw04304-A_024245-024511 yeah oh yeah i i understand that
sw04304-A_025499-026128 if somebody would at least [vocalized-noise] i don't know it's it's rough and i think that there's a
sw04304-A_026128-026343 well there a
sw04304-A_026343-026689 giving an example my girlfriend's uh sister
sw04304-A_026689-027043 is um marry married a uh
sw04304-A_027043-027732 married a uh psychologist and where they're living he they can they can afford for her not to work
sw04304-A_027732-028397 which she has not been doing since they since they've had uh children
sw04304-A_028397-029014 and especially i i think it would be ultimate really impossible because she just had twins not very long ago
sw04304-A_029014-029206 and uh
sw04304-A_029206-029490 and uh they
sw04304-A_029490-029994 [noise] you know they tell me that there's they get together and
sw04304-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04304-B_000844-001521 well i work with children um i don't have any right now uh myself um
sw04304-B_001521-002393 but we definitely do want to have um children and i work in the medical field so i work with children during the day quite a bit
sw04304-B_002393-002999 um well i have worked in family practice which in large part was pediatrics
sw04304-B_002999-003212 so i'm [noise]
sw04304-B_003212-003420 well aware of
sw04304-B_003420-003726 child care problems and needs
sw04304-B_003989-004232 i'm a physician assistant
sw04304-B_004232-004377 um-hum
sw04304-B_004377-004546 have you ever heard of that
sw04304-B_005007-005134 hum
sw04304-B_005134-005518 um well we're train to diagnose and prescribe and
sw04304-B_005518-006074 um in some states anyway their prescribing laws are different and
sw04304-B_006074-006466 in the particular job that i recently left um
sw04304-B_006466-006665 i was functioning
sw04304-B_006665-006955 as a family practitioner and
sw04304-B_006955-007386 just seeing patients of all varieties whatever you'd see in normal family practice
sw04304-B_007386-007665 pretty much what i did and i saw kids a lot
sw04304-B_007665-008293 they liked to see me because i wasn't an intimidating man doctor i guess [laughter]
sw04304-B_008293-008601 so they appreciated that
sw04304-B_008601-008755 but
sw04304-B_008755-008975 so do you have children
sw04304-B_010160-010827 hm [laughter] none that you're aware well that's our topic right [laughter]
sw04304-B_012071-012329 [laughter]
sw04304-B_013355-013490 um-hum
sw04304-B_013919-014186 well what are your views
sw04304-B_014186-014443 you can tell me i've
sw04304-B_014443-014855 doesn't matter if i agree or not oh [laughter]
sw04304-B_015303-015470 kind of what
sw04304-B_016630-016750 um-hum
sw04304-B_017019-017141 yeah
sw04304-B_018043-018175 um-hum
sw04304-B_018464-018855 well i agree with you there i i guess [vocalized-noise]
sw04304-B_018855-018999 um
sw04304-B_018999-019281 i- i suppose
sw04304-B_019281-020490 you know you could call me a career woman but i i do feel that i want to be at home with my kids mainly because i see that as such an important thing um
sw04304-B_020490-020658 [noise] that
sw04304-B_020658-020959 also i know of what a job takes out of me
sw04304-B_020959-021549 and i wouldn't have anything left over for my kids and i wouldn't want to do that to myself you know
sw04304-B_021549-022193 i mean these are human beings that we're trying to raise and help them be constructive members of society
sw04304-B_022311-022489 so [laughter]
sw04304-B_022489-023354 so i i'm with you there on the other hand i have a lot friends who are mothers and work full time in their careers and i wouldn't
sw04304-B_023354-023547 you know i
sw04304-B_023547-024277 their kids are darling too and i i would hate to give them the impression that i ju- am judging them
sw04304-B_024435-025171 yeah but on the other hand there some that are sacrificing their kids for the sake of their jobs and you know
sw04304-B_025171-025483 i'm sure their kids would be much better served if
sw04304-B_025626-025821 yeah
sw04304-B_026664-026794 um-hum
sw04304-B_027690-027902 um-hum
sw04304-B_028880-029017 oh
sw04304-B_029017-029259 yeah there's no way
sw04305-A_000000-000045 [noise]
sw04305-A_001017-001147 uh-huh
sw04305-A_001726-002511 alright and um so um in other words y- your bread and butter comes from the federal government
sw04305-A_002511-003083 right so your your uh your life sort of follows it's [vocalized-noise] flow
sw04305-A_003083-003578 so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they
sw04305-A_004068-004234 uh-huh
sw04305-A_007208-007400 sure i see what you're saying
sw04305-A_008508-008661 um-hum
sw04305-A_008904-009166 and that's just recently been taken away from you
sw04305-A_010364-010495 um
sw04305-A_011693-011881 development yeah
sw04305-A_012357-012949 well um you say now you say you get your health benefits is this a one hundred percent coverage
sw04305-A_013253-013391 yeah
sw04305-A_014770-014974 ability to choose
sw04305-A_015324-015465 um-hum
sw04305-A_015895-016032 um-hum
sw04305-A_016762-016887 um-hum
sw04305-A_018038-018204 um-hum
sw04305-A_018204-018368 sure
sw04305-A_018561-018675 [noise]
sw04305-A_020140-020818 well that's it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isn't done at the i guess at the federal level or
sw04305-A_020818-021725 or something i don't know about this but it's uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the washington area
sw04305-A_021725-022904 and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh l- the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money
sw04305-A_022904-023717 and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um
sw04305-A_023717-024837 the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were
sw04305-A_024837-025119 party to with with uh full dental and
sw04305-A_025119-026330 uh you know optical s- stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the h._m._o. idea
sw04305-A_026330-026987 appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out
sw04305-A_026987-028104 uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them i've change jobs now but this the same h._m._o. is still available in my current position and and um
sw04305-A_028104-029196 it's it's uh i the interesting thing they've done some interesting things with the hmo's in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh
sw04305-A_029196-029840 one of them that's run by prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the washington area
sw04305-B_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04305-B_000036-001056 i work for one of the defense contractors out here [laughter] actually it's it's not a defense contractor it's uh a federally funded research and development center
sw04305-B_001056-001742 [laughter] kind of like the mitre corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the air force in terms of satellites
sw04305-B_002323-002639 th- the government yes uh
sw04305-B_003005-003146 that's correct
sw04305-B_003475-004534 uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um
sw04305-B_004534-005359 i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um
sw04305-B_005359-006569 three weeks of vacation to start normally in california when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between christmas and new year's so you end up
sw04305-B_006569-007284 in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way
sw04305-B_007284-008100 uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between christmas and new year's
sw04305-B_008100-008550 uh the idea is that you've got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it
sw04305-B_008550-008923 so that was a big plus benefit for this company
sw04305-B_009064-010465 uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between christmas and new year's or take a week of no pay
sw04305-B_010465-011640 uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between christmas and new year's i don't believe that this is a long term
sw04305-B_011640-012396 solution that they're going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more
sw04305-B_012725-012867 uh
sw04305-B_012867-013295 uh-huh no i don't think any of unless of course you go with an h._m._o.
sw04305-B_013295-014746 uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses you're on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an h._m._o. though you lose the
sw04305-B_014746-015679 um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the h._m._o. or you choose the
sw04305-B_015679-016816 um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent
sw04305-B_016816-017597 so that that [noise] i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um
sw04305-B_017597-018571 an h._m._o. type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for r._c._a. back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything
sw04305-B_018571-020157 but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases
sw04305-B_020552-020681 right
sw04305-B_020681-020912 yeah
sw04305-B_021659-021815 uh-huh
sw04305-B_022730-022942 um-hum
sw04305-B_023436-023577 uh-huh
sw04305-B_024869-025015 huh
sw04305-B_025251-025529 uh-huh right
sw04305-B_025886-026038 wow
sw04305-B_027616-027743 hum
sw04306-A_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04306-A_000054-000349 so what do you think of the current jury system
sw04306-A_001593-002261 yeah def- definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and as much on the defendant's side as possible
sw04306-A_002261-002588 make sure you're not getting into a police state or anything close to it
sw04306-A_004242-004515 uh it just said trial by jury it didn't say either
sw04306-A_005575-006235 yeah i i think there's a lot more shades of gray that are possible and acceptable in civil trials than in criminal trials
sw04306-A_006235-006676 criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didn't it happened
sw04306-A_006676-007595 where in the civil trial there's a more wider range of you know whether this contract was satisfied fully satisfied partly satisfied
sw04306-A_007595-007741 or so on
sw04306-A_008512-009217 so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be
sw04306-A_009217-009406 i think you really want
sw04306-A_009406-010015 another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for
sw04306-A_010015-010556 and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be
sw04306-A_011178-011308 yeah
sw04306-A_012422-012879 right that get overturned or changed on the first appeal
sw04306-A_012879-013607 where as if they came up with a more reasonable one the first time through maybe you wouldn't need to tie up the system with all these appeals
sw04306-A_016021-016209 yeah well th- th- the
sw04306-A_016896-017024 right
sw04306-A_017546-017737 and i also think ye-
sw04306-A_017737-018526 on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards should really go more towards let's say the government and supporting the court system
sw04306-A_018526-019289 there's no reason an individual person should get the punitive damages i think that's more of
sw04306-A_019289-019646 you know i- it's something that doesn't really
sw04306-A_019646-020139 you know the person is already being compensated for his losses and injuries
sw04306-A_020139-020750 the punitive damages are more of a slap on the wrist of the person doing or the corporation doing the injury
sw04306-A_020750-021270 and having that go to the person who does the suing doesn't quite make sense
sw04306-A_022443-022586 right
sw04306-A_024473-024905 no i think five million dollars would definitely cut into the executive bonuses of g._m.
sw04306-A_025718-025933 yes yes [laughter]
sw04306-A_025933-026290 and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the
sw04306-A_026562-026952 you know the other thing i guess on the topic that i'd bring up is um
sw04306-A_026952-027457 the insanity defensives i don't never quite liked that temporary insanity
sw04306-A_029728-029853 right
sw04306-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04306-B_000277-000715 oh i think basically it works okay the uh
sw04306-B_000715-001010 i do think that we need to have
sw04306-B_001010-001571 unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes
sw04306-B_002209-002386 yeah absolutely
sw04306-B_002551-002736 right absolutely
sw04306-B_002910-003186 the uh i think that
sw04306-B_003186-003696 when they have unanimous verdicts in some civil trials i think that's okay but
sw04306-B_003696-003834 uh
sw04306-B_003834-004260 i'm not sure if they said we're supposed to just talk about civil or criminal or both
sw04306-B_004500-004726 okay well for civil
sw04306-B_004726-005384 i think a i think in a lot of cases in civil trials you can have a i think ten to two
sw04306-B_005384-005562 is acceptable
sw04306-B_007731-007961 right yeah there's a lot more
sw04306-B_007961-008576 variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it it's
sw04306-B_010502-011248 i agree and i agree that the jury in those kinds of civil trials can even apportion the liability if it's a liability type of thing
sw04306-B_011248-012502 that it's forty percent this guy sixty the other or whatever but uh in civil trials juries have come up with some really ridiculous awards
sw04306-B_012836-012968 right
sw04306-B_013569-014347 right i agree and i think that uh certainly were i in a paralyzed or something i'd want eighty three zillion dollars
sw04306-B_014347-014703 but uh i think rationally
sw04306-B_014703-015751 eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what i'd really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of
sw04306-B_015751-015879 me
sw04306-B_015879-016068 for the rest of my life
sw04306-B_016068-016565 wish that i had proper care and medical treatment but giving me an extra
sw04306-B_016565-016988 million and millions of dollars that i couldn't do a damn thing with anyway
sw04306-B_016988-017749 and uh wouldn't really help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half
sw04306-B_019019-019147 right
sw04306-B_020088-020257 yeah
sw04306-B_021213-021614 right also punitive damages in general i mean if
sw04306-B_021614-021753 there's
sw04306-B_021753-022499 if i'm hurt in a car accident and there's punitive damages of five million dollars against you i'd probably never collect it
sw04306-B_022499-023367 and if it's because your car was bad and it's five million dollars against general motors that's probably small change to them
sw04306-B_023367-024541 and it's not really punitive against either one because general motors five million is nothing and to you since it's uncollectable it doesn't make much difference anyway
sw04306-B_024908-025834 uh [laughter] i don't know it's a good question i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but
sw04306-B_025834-026011 the uh
sw04306-B_027397-027939 well i like what some states have including colorado
sw04306-B_027939-028576 and idaho the wording is something like on the insanity it's
sw04306-B_028576-029013 instead of not guilty because you're insane
sw04306-B_029013-029539 so they send you to the mental hospital it's guilty
sw04306-B_029539-029853 and insane something like
sw04307-A_000000-000069 [noise]
sw04307-A_000069-000401 yeah um my opinion uh
sw04307-A_000401-001128 is not quite well enough formulated for for real debate but above all i r- really believe
sw04307-A_001128-002250 that uh first of all people are innocent until proven guilty and secondly that th- in some sense there's a sort of sanctity of the body issue in that i don't
sw04307-A_002250-003064 really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent
sw04307-A_003064-004253 so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my con- conviction that i i do not believe that uh spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be
sw04307-A_004253-004680 you know mandated however they could be done with the person's consent
sw04307-A_005480-005604 um
sw04307-A_005604-005766 [noise]
sw04307-A_006222-006363 [laughter]
sw04307-A_007003-007147 right
sw04307-A_008689-008787 [noise]
sw04307-A_008954-009692 okay [noise] well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well
sw04307-A_009692-010307 and uh in the case of driving it's not a i- it's a privilege to drive
sw04307-A_010307-011195 and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know
sw04307-A_011195-011391 yeah
sw04307-A_011391-011883 right in that case because it c- clearly endangers someone in that case
sw04307-A_014308-014438 um-hum
sw04307-A_015457-016340 [noise] oh i see you're you're a much more baser a- a- at the issue of uh of the drug issue than i am apparently uh
sw04307-A_021885-022075 ah wow
sw04307-A_022732-023897 well uh as as far as i- i'm not sure you you sort of seem to be kind of saying that you have the right to uh pursue any kind of substance that you'd like except for in certain
sw04307-A_023897-024208 circumstances like driving is that what you're trying to say
sw04307-A_025155-025285 [noise]
sw04307-A_025285-025461 right
sw04307-A_025789-026811 well not having alcohol t- prohibition and and uh tobacco prohibition uh i think those are more historical artifact of uh
sw04307-A_026811-027142 the link between the business and the government though because there
sw04307-A_027280-027408 yeah
sw04307-A_027862-028159 [laughter] well hey they were successful
sw04307-A_028606-029150 well i'm i guess we should get back to to the the drug testing issue
sw04307-A_029150-029885 yeah um well i'm trying to think of of more coherent thought it's kind of difficult to have a debate
sw04307-B_000000-000198 [noise] drug testing hey
sw04307-B_004641-005696 i'm a little bit more uh against it than that because i see this as an absolute parallel to the mccarthy witch hunts when anybody who held
sw04307-B_005696-006308 liberal opinions or supported civil rights was considered an evil satanic agent of moscow
sw04307-B_006308-006763 quite often i m- there's the legitimate concern of people who are too stupid
sw04307-B_006763-007220 not to use chemicals that im- can impair their behavior in a job
sw04307-B_007220-007837 where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or uh driving buses
sw04307-B_007837-009049 and also uh the uh strictures against driving uh uni- while impaired should apply to any chemical of any kind whether the government has authorized the use of that chemical or not
sw04307-B_011104-011762 and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense but this is not the issue here
sw04307-B_011762-012916 it's not the issue in question though because what the government is trying to do is to truly impose thought control they are saying there are things you cannot do to your mind and body because we have not authorized to do it
sw04307-B_012916-013143 and further more if we think that you are
sw04307-B_013143-013854 uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior
sw04307-B_013854-014926 now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask
sw04307-B_014926-015512 they shouldn't have the right to prohibit these chemicals what they should have the right to prohibit is misuse of anything
sw04307-B_016209-017027 yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent
sw04307-B_017027-018494 of the tests and the positive tests and the arrests contain concern marijuana the only commonly used drug that has no traceable deaths from overuse none even aspirin kills thirty two people a year
sw04307-B_018494-019812 and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse uh general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that
sw04307-B_019812-020563 and so on top of that goes the whole republican drug testing uh intervention and control of your body attitude
sw04307-B_020563-021898 an interesting side note of this is the motorola company lost eighteen months of development on the oh four oh chip because they instituted drug testing and the entire development team for that chip left the company
sw04307-B_022047-022707 and that's why it took this long for the oh four oh to get out they scuttled their own boat and cost themselves millions of dollars for that
sw04307-B_024149-025107 i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at
sw04307-B_025107-025759 not the uh not the direct cause of it it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition
sw04307-B_027033-027327 yeah that's true too especially with tobacco
sw04307-B_027327-027929 and alcohol they did try to ban it they failed utterly they failed miserably and led to the creation of the modern day mafia
sw04307-B_027929-028534 and that's pretty much what's happ- that's pretty much what's happened with other with the the current prohibition
sw04307-B_029022-029294 to tell yeah that we are getting a stray
sw04308-A_000000-000832 [noise] well this is this is a good topic for me uh it is my mother and i bough- well my mother bought a house um
sw04308-A_000832-001970 -bout two or three years ago and it was about to be repossessed and the people that lived in this house were real filthy they had animals and they smoked and it was just a real dirty house
sw04308-A_001970-002544 so we had to redo everything on the inside we've painted all the walls
sw04308-A_002544-003848 uh redone the floors completely because the carpet was destroyed and um our last big project was the hall bathroom and uh we just finished that
sw04308-A_004457-005286 oh real successful it it it took us a long time because we couldn't afford to pay pay to have it done
sw04308-A_005286-005942 and if we had of paid to have it done they wouldn't have been as meticulous about everything as we are
sw04308-A_005942-006428 and um so i- it worked out real well we're very pleased with it
sw04308-A_006999-007128 uh-huh
sw04308-A_007646-007803 oh my goodness
