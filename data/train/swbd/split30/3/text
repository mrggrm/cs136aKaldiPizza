sw04025-B_029467-029611 right
sw04026-A_000000-000232 [noise] oh how's your products been [noise]
sw04026-A_001060-001543 [laughter] i hear that one have you had any lately go out
sw04026-A_003226-003388 oh wow
sw04026-A_003521-004014 so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
sw04026-A_004014-004896 [laughter]
sw04026-A_004896-005510 you're kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
sw04026-A_005624-005796 yeah
sw04026-A_005796-006486 [vocalized-noise] the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and
sw04026-A_006486-006871 i bought this paint stripper where they advertise [noise]
sw04026-A_006871-007314 that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product
sw04026-A_007314-007691 it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
sw04026-A_007691-008217 i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it
sw04026-A_008217-008722 but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
sw04026-A_009556-009723 that's incredib-
sw04026-A_010562-010729 [laughter]
sw04026-A_011331-011565 and they all went out at the same time
sw04026-A_011565-011727 or two days
sw04026-A_011727-011858 wow
sw04026-A_012107-012281 [laughter]
sw04026-A_014408-014618 wow that's frustrating
sw04026-A_015053-015232 [laughter]
sw04026-A_015553-015682 uh-huh
sw04026-A_016803-017007 uh-huh they go out a lot
sw04026-A_018721-019418 yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i -ust home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
sw04026-A_019418-019548 yeah
sw04026-A_019548-019802 at morton international and
sw04026-A_019802-020384 i thin- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything
sw04026-A_020384-020630 after each assembly process
sw04026-A_020630-020967 and so our testing is pretty thorough but
sw04026-A_021277-021415 um
sw04026-A_022108-022523 um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't
sw04026-A_022523-023084 i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag
sw04026-A_023084-024243 and but we do test after during the assembly proj- product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there
sw04026-A_024243-024973 after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
sw04026-A_024973-025433 and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so
sw04026-A_026368-026552 [laughter]
sw04026-A_026552-026643 yeah
sw04026-A_027349-027739 well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
sw04026-A_027739-028075 it's incredible how much testing they have to do
sw04026-A_028683-028814 uh-huh
sw04026-B_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04026-B_000208-000850 um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy
sw04026-B_000850-001185 goes bad just after the warranty runs out
sw04026-B_001444-001997 yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave
sw04026-B_001997-002832 all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh
sw04026-B_002832-003349 i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
sw04026-B_003349-003595 yeah it was a hassle [noise]
sw04026-B_003883-004611 yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the i- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself
sw04026-B_004611-005028 lasted three years and it was three years and two months
sw04026-B_005028-005197 no
sw04026-B_005522-005728 uh watch out
sw04026-B_006298-006431 um-hum
sw04026-B_007615-007734 hm
sw04026-B_008707-009067 i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
sw04026-B_009067-009602 i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
sw04026-B_009602-010093 the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh
sw04026-B_010194-010777 microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh
sw04026-B_010777-011354 the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
sw04026-B_011516-011789 uh within two days of each other
sw04026-B_011789-011929 i was
sw04026-B_011929-012210 it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
sw04026-B_012210-012715 and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so
sw04026-B_012715-013074 even if uh i think even if i had uh
sw04026-B_013074-013399 had kept the warranty the service agreements were
sw04026-B_013399-013861 with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that
sw04026-B_013861-014449 retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not
sw04026-B_014558-014921 but i didn't have to worry about all that because
sw04026-B_014921-015126 they weren't under warranty
sw04026-B_015126-015285 so
sw04026-B_015285-015592 it was a call to the local appliance dealer
sw04026-B_015702-015945 who came out and fixed them all but
sw04026-B_015945-016374 i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um
sw04026-B_016374-016895 i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
sw04026-B_016895-017463 yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and
sw04026-B_017463-017796 the other two weren't but i just
sw04026-B_017796-018085 other than that you know tvs and
sw04026-B_018085-018791 things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
sw04026-B_019345-019637 oh really that's interesting
sw04026-B_020963-021465 do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
sw04026-B_021465-022162 like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
sw04026-B_023019-023152 um-hum
sw04026-B_025374-026125 well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
sw04026-B_026125-026481 luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
sw04026-B_026481-026810 but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm
sw04026-B_026810-027235 seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to
sw04026-B_027235-027448 to come about but that
sw04026-B_027996-028741 oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
sw04026-B_028741-029274 if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
sw04026-B_029274-029847 it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
sw04027-A_000000-000118 [noise]
sw04027-A_001344-001900 well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named milton friedman

sw04027-A_002573-003276 [noise] he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe
sw04027-A_003276-003951 uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh
sw04027-A_003951-004845 and i'm a m- kind of a milton friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um
sw04027-A_004845-004944 [noise]
sw04027-A_005058-006179 that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a c._p._a. and i c- i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh
sw04027-A_006179-006606 in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they
sw04027-A_006606-006769 take money from them
sw04027-A_006871-007193 [vocalized-noise] you bet i do yep
sw04027-A_007193-007846 [noise] something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i'd i can't believe how
sw04027-A_007846-008589 ta- y- you know [vocalized-noise] our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how
sw04027-A_008589-009256 tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue
sw04027-A_009501-009601 uh-huh
sw04027-A_009802-009900 uh-huh
sw04027-A_010785-010927 th- that's right

sw04027-A_011316-011406 uh-huh
sw04027-A_011406-011499 [noise]
sw04027-A_011694-011800 right
sw04027-A_011800-012452 the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right
sw04027-A_012452-013150 but for every man woman and child in the united states they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece
sw04027-A_013150-013686 i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
sw04027-A_013686-013900 i'd be done i'd be sunk
sw04027-A_013900-014374 you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt
sw04027-A_014374-015293 i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the soviet union did
sw04027-A_015293-015740 or uh i i don't know how how how can we
sw04027-A_015855-016255 yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh
sw04027-A_016462-017373 yeah because we write off debts we loaned the mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them
sw04027-A_017373-018170 that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was turkey we wanted to use their air strips during the persian gulf
sw04027-A_018170-018743 so we just went over there and said gee guys uh you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it
sw04027-A_018743-018927 that's ridiculous
sw04027-A_018927-019999 and uh and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other f- from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise me

sw04027-A_022806-023070 [laughter] that's true
sw04027-A_023070-023316 and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong
sw04027-A_024141-024255 uh-huh
sw04027-A_028640-028900 [laughter]
sw04027-A_029865-029946 right
sw04027-B_000000-000054 [noise]
sw04027-B_000260-001400 um [noise] so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual [vocalized-noise] uh lives
sw04027-B_001841-002143 um yeah he's a commentator isn't he
sw04027-B_002813-002941 uh-huh

sw04027-B_009141-009528 yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point
sw04027-B_009528-009838 i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned
sw04027-B_009838-010421 you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you know have this bread and circuses policy of

sw04027-B_018138-018246 uh-huh
sw04027-B_018696-018841 uh-huh
sw04027-B_018841-018986 uh-huh
sw04027-B_020035-020207 yeah maybe i would [noise]
sw04027-B_020330-020698 we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
sw04027-B_020799-021058 i uh um
sw04027-B_021874-022227 well it in it um
sw04027-B_022227-022955 i think if anyone but the japanese had made it if [vocalized-noise] if an american had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them [laughter]
sw04027-B_022955-023095 [noise]
sw04027-B_023206-023458 oh yeah yeah yeah [noise]
sw04027-B_023458-023620 um
sw04027-B_023620-024163 you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy
sw04027-B_024163-024502 um in management um
sw04027-B_024502-024701 you know our
sw04027-B_024701-024950 we you know we we you know [vocalized-noise]
sw04027-B_024950-025430 you know the trend of of over consumption since world war two um
sw04027-B_025430-026613 you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy [vocalized-noise] thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that you know [vocalized-noise] just moved for better and better standards of living
sw04027-B_026613-027093 and where a bunch of other factors i think you know [vocalized-noise] is just
sw04027-B_027093-027632 you know [vocalized-noise] it's [vocalized-noise] it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that
sw04027-B_027632-028144 you know when when you know when when you combine with the with the mismanagement that a lot of american companies have had
sw04027-B_028144-028706 and yeah i think that you know that's [vocalized-noise] when he says that they were la- i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use
sw04027-B_028706-029800 but i think you know you know un- [vocalized-noise] unwilling you know un- the american workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are
sw04028-A_000000-000945 [noise] okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
sw04028-A_001399-001517 uh-huh
sw04028-A_001884-002012 um-hum
sw04028-A_002012-002521 well um does your company have good benefits in that [noise] in that regard
sw04028-A_002897-003014 uh-huh
sw04028-A_004448-004567 oh yeah
sw04028-A_004866-004996 um-hum
sw04028-A_006389-006494 hm
sw04028-A_006729-006836 i see
sw04028-A_006836-007450 uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an h._m._o. um so
sw04028-A_007450-008402 that's in my opinion that's gett- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um
sw04028-A_010065-010206 um-hum
sw04028-A_010974-011107 right
sw04028-A_012606-012731 yes
sw04028-A_012731-013095 that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been
sw04028-A_013095-013619 when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
sw04028-A_013619-014025 and uh at that time i immediately joined the h._m._o. and i never really
sw04028-A_014025-014694 so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the h._m._o. and uh you know for me it's worked out real good
sw04028-A_016146-016273 um-hum
sw04028-A_017122-017235 hm
sw04028-A_017512-017631 um-hum
sw04028-A_017631-018427 yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh georgia tech in the research branch and i guess
sw04028-A_018427-019342 another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit
sw04028-A_019547-020086 right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
sw04028-A_021310-021450 um-hum
sw04028-A_022791-022906 um-hum
sw04028-A_023080-023300 [laughter] right
sw04028-A_023482-024313 well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with
sw04028-A_024313-024419 um
sw04028-A_024419-025227 and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
sw04028-A_026236-026366 right
sw04028-A_026609-026733 right
sw04028-A_027732-027851 um-hum
sw04028-A_028245-028366 oh yeah
sw04028-A_028760-028893 um-hum
sw04028-A_029277-029414 okay are there
sw04028-A_029414-029840 [noise] are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benef-
sw04028-B_000000-000060 [noise]
sw04028-B_000911-001541 uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh
sw04028-B_001541-001927 covering medical costs for yourself or family members
sw04028-B_002469-003380 yeah i thin- i work for a a public school system district and uh [noise] so it's different than a company where
sw04028-B_003380-003881 most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um
sw04028-B_003881-004098 the employee must pick up
sw04028-B_004098-005156 a greater figure in the way of uh costs but i- overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration
sw04028-B_005156-005450 is because of the cost of insurance
sw04028-B_005450-006537 going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
sw04028-B_006537-006912 it has not disturbed me any how about yourself
sw04028-B_007227-007362 uh-huh
sw04028-B_008254-008511 right yeah our district did that
sw04028-B_008511-009339 for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the h._m._o. and um
sw04028-B_009443-010300 i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um
sw04028-B_010300-010404 uh
sw04028-B_010404-011445 i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i- i have to say it really works but again
sw04028-B_011445-012395 i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join
sw04028-B_012395-012826 it can be very stressful for you know those people
sw04028-B_013557-013679 uh-huh
sw04028-B_014411-014554 yeah
sw04028-B_014554-014979 right but if you you know have a family and and um
sw04028-B_014979-015526 everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel
sw04028-B_015526-016476 knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and
sw04028-B_016476-017424 my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as
sw04028-B_017424-017658 you know good so [noise]
sw04028-B_017658-017771 uh
sw04028-B_018132-018286 oh all right
sw04028-B_019355-019742 i do too are you talking about like spring break and right
sw04028-B_019742-019888 right
sw04028-B_020002-020254 it it really um
sw04028-B_020254-020448 [noise] i don't think
sw04028-B_020448-021059 most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but
sw04028-B_021059-021565 i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just
sw04028-B_021565-021757 texas has really um
sw04028-B_021757-021857 [noise]
sw04028-B_021857-022448 you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just
sw04028-B_022448-023535 we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there
sw04028-B_024209-024418 okay i li-
sw04028-B_025202-025557 well that's good yeah i would think that that type of
sw04028-B_025557-025773 employment you're you're
sw04028-B_025773-026419 one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um
sw04028-B_026419-026662 you know it's good that they allow you that
sw04028-B_026662-027250 it um a- i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get
sw04028-B_027250-027563 many days off and um
sw04028-B_027563-028390 we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time
sw04028-B_028390-029015 i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just
sw04028-B_029015-029326 continued to uh stay there

sw04029-A_005000-005155 i see
sw04029-A_005155-005309 [noise]

sw04029-A_007427-007529 yeah
sw04029-A_008280-008435 something like that
sw04029-A_008544-008636 oh
sw04029-A_008636-009221 do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or
sw04029-A_010032-010199 [laughter]
sw04029-A_012369-012513 [laughter]
sw04029-A_012651-012826 that's right that's right
sw04029-A_012826-013295 well mine mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now
sw04029-A_013295-013457 [noise]
sw04029-A_013655-013980 i found a technician who works at t._i.
sw04029-A_013980-014249 and does things like that in his spare time
sw04029-A_014660-014752 oh yeah
sw04029-A_014752-014855 yeah
sw04029-A_014855-015463 but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home
sw04029-A_017349-017456 yeah
sw04029-A_017557-017775 yeah i've done a lot of that
sw04029-A_017775-018263 and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or
sw04029-A_018263-018672 have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it
sw04029-A_018672-018876 what else do you need right
sw04029-A_019124-019360 well that's probably true
sw04029-A_019360-019512 [laughter]
sw04029-A_019512-019596 [noise]
sw04029-A_020000-020090 [laughter]

sw04029-A_021325-021527 just standard card solitaire
sw04029-A_021527-022832 but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and [laughter]
sw04029-A_023077-023499 i ju- i just happened to stumble across that of course i don't play games at work right [laughter]
sw04029-A_024397-024504 uh-huh
sw04029-A_026348-026497 that's right [laughter]
sw04029-A_026497-026839 [laughter] i was going to say you must have a printer then
sw04029-A_026839-026916 [laughter]
sw04029-A_027447-027551 uh-huh
sw04029-B_000240-000738 uh we still have an old uh texas instruments
sw04029-B_000738-000926 professional computer
sw04029-B_000926-002065 back in the days when t._i. was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the i._b._m. i don't remember what those were the ats or something like that or
sw04029-B_002212-003241 [laughter] way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it unfortunately so we just sort of stumble on using
sw04029-B_003241-003534 the same stuff that we always have
sw04029-B_003728-004654 um well i used to i have a master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about
sw04029-B_004654-005076 six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
sw04029-B_005076-005908 so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
sw04029-B_005908-006241 creative writing without having to have uh
sw04029-B_006241-006595 uh the mechanics of
sw04029-B_006701-007063 handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
sw04029-B_007063-007637 he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i'd like a
sw04029-B_007637-007820 a more logical
sw04029-B_007820-008073 arrangement of the letters and uh
sw04029-B_008073-008352 what do they call it the cortiope or something
sw04029-B_008352-008503 arrangement
sw04029-B_009146-009288 um
sw04029-B_009288-009480 we haven't for
sw04029-B_009480-009772 we ended up uh
sw04029-B_009772-010581 actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isn't that a terrible statement people who are
sw04029-B_010581-011180 we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um
sw04029-B_011314-011942 i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
sw04029-B_011942-012434 it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
sw04029-B_012434-012693 but then you have to remember to write it down
sw04029-B_012867-012996 or enter it
sw04029-B_013161-013354 oh my
sw04029-B_013354-013648 where do you find a place to work on a t._i.
sw04029-B_013904-014042 uh-huh
sw04029-B_014358-014732 well that's nice to know that there are still such people around
sw04029-B_015468-015990 yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until
sw04029-B_016144-016667 as i say until i took a hi- hiatus from working i used to
sw04029-B_016667-016851 to uh
sw04029-B_016976-017407 trying to think of what you call it i- i used it essentially as a terminal then
sw04029-B_017407-017498 you know
sw04029-B_017498-017733 and
sw04029-B_017733-017831 so
sw04029-B_018634-018735 yeah
sw04029-B_018868-019176 well my kids think i should have games
sw04029-B_019176-019514 on top of games on top of games [laughter]
sw04029-B_019514-020108 and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program [laughter]
sw04029-B_020255-020561 write your own games yeah i just
sw04029-B_021017-021142 oh
sw04029-B_021473-021571 yeah
sw04029-B_022243-022398 oh really
sw04029-B_022749-022917 [laughter]
sw04029-B_022917-023416 uh
sw04029-B_023416-023744 no who would do something like that
sw04029-B_023744-023898 but uh
sw04029-B_024024-024434 yeah we have basically we use the wordstar on it
sw04029-B_024434-024667 you know for a bunch of
sw04029-B_024818-025088 i'm taking a class now and
sw04029-B_025088-025562 um i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the
sw04029-B_025562-026715 and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
sw04029-B_026715-027942 right [laughter] right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the
sw04029-B_027942-029211 connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the
sw04029-B_029211-029840 you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to wo-
sw04030-A_000000-000519 [noise] well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the mid east what do you what do you think
sw04030-A_002401-002518 yeah
sw04030-A_002621-002849 it that that happens a lot doesn't it
sw04030-A_002849-003149 wars don't usually settle things [laughter] much
sw04030-A_003149-003698 um um and i i guess i i feel like we
sw04030-A_003698-004161 we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing
sw04030-A_004161-004659 uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts
sw04030-A_004659-005850 and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such
sw04030-A_005850-006126 we wouldn't have done this you know
sw04030-A_006126-006248 and would
sw04030-A_007416-007560 uh-huh
sw04030-A_008399-008548 yes [laughter]
sw04030-A_009052-009195 uh-huh
sw04030-A_009361-009483 yeah

sw04030-A_009909-010005 [laughter]
sw04030-A_010005-010293 i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it
sw04030-A_010293-010431 oh
sw04030-A_011101-011274 yeah um
sw04030-A_011498-011608 right
sw04030-A_011904-012249 on our hi- on our really bad list [laughter]
sw04030-A_012549-013949 and i i i keep reading about jordan's king hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is
sw04030-A_015250-015541 r- yes yes right
sw04030-A_015541-015677 right
sw04030-A_016304-016953 of doing that either no [laughter] no i i i i just get a sense of our
sw04030-A_016953-017686 walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something
sw04030-A_017686-018273 didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or
sw04030-A_018273-018953 something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman
sw04030-A_018953-019901 you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while
sw04030-A_019901-021123 and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but
sw04030-A_024455-024692 oh absolutely yes
sw04030-A_024692-025232 i mean wh- which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation [laughter]
sw04030-A_025232-026449 every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like
sw04030-A_026449-026549 um
sw04030-A_026650-026738 yes
sw04030-A_026738-027222 it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like
sw04030-A_027222-027693 golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance
sw04030-A_027693-028427 possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting
sw04030-A_028427-028844 i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean don't
sw04030-A_028844-029562 [laughter] i i s- i i did see one of the peace rallies where they just said [laughter] i can't remember the exact thing it was
sw04030-A_029562-029939 something like george and sa- and saddam go home
sw04030-B_000000-000066 [noise]
sw04030-B_000501-000747 well yeah i uh
sw04030-B_000747-001462 and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it
sw04030-B_001462-002207 a year a year ago now when the the war desert storm was finishing up seems like things were uh
sw04030-B_002207-002703 going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all i've
sw04030-B_002804-002899 um-hum
sw04030-B_003006-003198 yeah right
sw04030-B_004112-004249 right
sw04030-B_006062-006436 yeah and and i- i think there's a
sw04030-B_006541-006913 yeah i- i- i i have very much doubt that
sw04030-B_006913-007513 that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on
sw04030-B_007513-008468 in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend
sw04030-B_008468-008648 and that that
sw04030-B_008648-009127 saddam hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against iran
sw04030-B_009127-009746 and uh iran was our bigger enemy and then [laughter] when it turns out that uh saddam hussein
sw04030-B_009848-009963 right
sw04030-B_009963-010065 right
sw04030-B_010065-010195 and
sw04030-B_010195-010843 righ- oh yes yes and when we decided saddam hussein was our enemy then the uh uh
sw04030-B_010843-011303 oh what's his name in uh syria uh
sw04030-B_011303-012475 uh hafaia susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh
sw04030-B_012475-012667 you know and
sw04030-B_013318-013443 right
sw04030-B_013868-014261 right right and and uh
sw04030-B_014418-014977 i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being
sw04030-B_014977-015624 so definitely tied to to the israeli side in terms of all of that israeli versus arab
sw04030-B_015624-015878 and uh
sw04030-B_015878-016768 i haven't seen uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that [laughter] yeah yeah so
sw04030-B_017555-017665 right
sw04030-B_017665-017761 right
sw04030-B_018218-018397 right and
sw04030-B_018932-019051 yes
sw04030-B_021085-021433 yeah well it it
sw04030-B_021433-022124 from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding
sw04030-B_022124-022503 [laughter] to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh
sw04030-B_022503-023068 i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh iraq in particular
sw04030-B_023068-023666 was that it seemed to me that george bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that
sw04030-B_023666-024548 that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that saddam hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
sw04030-B_024548-024819 and and that uh
sw04030-B_025187-025451 uh oh boy
sw04030-B_026484-026914 oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fa- fascinating watching
sw04030-B_026914-027041 yes
sw04030-B_027751-027886 yeah
sw04030-B_028353-028470 right
sw04030-B_028470-028596 right
sw04030-B_028700-028842 yes
sw04030-B_028842-028951 yes
sw04031-A_000000-000028 [noise]
sw04031-A_000028-000197 huh
sw04031-A_000197-000934 yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget
sw04031-A_001673-002866 yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called mastering your money by ron blue
sw04031-A_002866-004181 you've you've heard of him it's r- it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um
sw04031-A_004181-004916 ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um
sw04031-A_004916-005657 the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um
sw04031-A_005657-006504 the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so
sw04031-A_006504-006955 we may spend a little more there and a little less in a- in another area
sw04031-A_006955-007492 so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um
sw04031-A_007492-008440 you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do
sw04031-A_008440-009113 [noise] well [noise] we um
sw04031-A_009113-010172 i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend no you may not
sw04031-A_010172-011246 um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know [noise] some people do um [noise] en- en- envelope
sw04031-A_011246-011827 systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me
sw04031-A_012529-013770 yes we have um [vocalized-noise] we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and
sw04031-A_013770-014931 uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of [noise] it in cd's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have
sw04031-A_014931-016072 and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to
sw04031-A_016072-016731 put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for
sw04031-A_016731-017312 i- you know things you know things like that and then um
sw04031-A_017312-018095 that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be
sw04031-A_018557-018841 i i'm sorry i didn'- i didn't hear you
sw04031-A_019019-019249 yeah
sw04031-A_019440-019604 um
sw04031-A_019782-021112 well he recommends that you don't um or he hel- he recommends that you you get them down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um
sw04031-A_021112-022358 every month if we use them um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um
sw04031-A_022358-023186 [noise] i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it al- we will always work it out where
sw04031-A_023186-024281 where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards
sw04031-A_024281-025582 because that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit
sw04031-A_025582-025931 so are you married
sw04031-A_026751-027057 which will suck up your money real quick

sw04031-B_000000-000126 is all you need
sw04031-B_000126-000266 i think just one is all you need
sw04031-B_000860-001731 well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before
sw04031-B_002415-002540 hm
sw04031-B_002780-002962 oh yeah i've heard of that
sw04031-B_004751-004910 um-hum
sw04031-B_006888-007044 um-hum
sw04031-B_008367-008881 have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing
sw04031-B_010174-010328 um-hum
sw04031-B_011229-011372 um-hum
sw04031-B_011767-012605 well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain s- uh you know savings objectives
sw04031-B_013617-013839 i mean where do you put that money

sw04031-B_016865-017016 um-hum
sw04031-B_017983-018530 that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted
sw04031-B_018728-019534 i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or
sw04031-B_019534-019854 is that part of the system to discontinue that
sw04031-B_020755-020899 um-hum
sw04031-B_023772-023900 um-hum
sw04031-B_024203-024344 um-hum

sw04032-A_018161-019118 um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and
sw04032-A_019118-019690 oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy an- so that's what he does he wears his
sw04032-A_019690-019944 his brace and his high tops and
sw04032-A_020173-020319 oh
sw04032-A_020423-020611 uh oh shoot

sw04032-A_021485-021881 [laughter] oh dear [laughter] oh
sw04032-A_022297-022824 it is amazing how fast you take off the inches
sw04032-A_022824-023838 and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video
sw04032-A_023838-024130 um and then the bike on the other day
sw04032-A_024130-024674 but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds
sw04032-A_024674-025338 real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights
sw04032-A_025338-026425 for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells
sw04032-A_026425-027116 and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video
sw04032-A_027116-027239 so
sw04032-A_027239-027655 it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to
sw04032-A_027655-028097 losing this weight and being firm and healthy [laughter]
sw04032-A_028370-028513 yes
sw04032-A_028513-028870 yes now this one has been quite mild um
sw04032-A_028870-029666 we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
sw04032-A_029666-029946 it was quite chilly but not
sw04032-B_000000-000052 [noise]
sw04032-B_000287-001096 yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do
sw04032-B_001564-001724 yeah
sw04032-B_001724-002872 um [laughter] in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
sw04032-B_002872-003201 but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold
sw04032-B_003201-003600 um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
sw04032-B_003600-003697 um
sw04032-B_003799-003972 how about yourself
sw04032-B_004503-004606 uh-huh
sw04032-B_005554-005679 um-hum
sw04032-B_006339-006896 right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
sw04032-B_007697-007813 um-hum
sw04032-B_010000-010090 huh
sw04032-B_010090-010518 yes it's it's it's aerob- it's similar to aerobics with weights
sw04032-B_010518-010889 but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights
sw04032-B_010889-011276 okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
sw04032-B_011719-012210 uh yes i have in in atlanta that's um most of the health clubs
sw04032-B_012210-012515 are all that's the that's the in thing
sw04032-B_012515-013066 at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
sw04032-B_013215-013659 um it they call it a low impact aerobics
sw04032-B_013659-014012 and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
sw04032-B_014012-014320 and from when i've done it it does give you a good
sw04032-B_014320-014521 a real good workout
sw04032-B_014521-015078 but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
sw04032-B_015078-015422 you know that and movement of going up on the step
sw04032-B_015422-015651 you know that could create a problem
sw04032-B_015752-016139 they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know [noise]
sw04032-B_016612-016802 yeah i i think
sw04032-B_016802-017142 my ankles probably are my lame weak point but
sw04032-B_017142-017835 i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
sw04032-B_017835-018299 and um we- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so

sw04032-B_019428-019580 yeah i
sw04032-B_019848-019952 um-hum
sw04032-B_019952-020462 yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
sw04032-B_020462-020600 [laughter] i mean
sw04032-B_020600-020987 it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it
sw04032-B_020987-021516 because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
sw04032-B_021516-021747 [laughter]
sw04032-B_021871-022329 but um so how how successful is your exercise video
sw04032-B_022771-022889 uh-huh
sw04032-B_024115-024182 um
sw04032-B_024621-024748 um-hum
sw04032-B_026370-026497 um-hum
sw04032-B_027108-027290 so it's a good workout
sw04032-B_027290-027400 [noise]
sw04032-B_027761-027901 um-hum
sw04032-B_028022-028536 so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow
sw04033-A_000000-000318 [noise] so how do you get most of your current event information
sw04033-A_000702-000840 uh-huh
sw04033-A_001926-002059 right
sw04033-A_002221-002342 um-hum
sw04033-A_002694-003200 i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
sw04033-A_003327-003456 yeah
sw04033-A_003898-004944 right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um
sw04033-A_004944-005447 talking with people and just hearing what's going on but
sw04033-A_005713-006345 just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
sw04033-A_006345-006510 so
sw04033-A_006964-007266 oh uh-huh yeah
sw04033-A_008766-009700 right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a c- candidate can get them to follow then the news will
sw04033-A_009700-010003 you know kind of publicize his name
sw04033-A_010003-010631 i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
sw04033-A_011781-011911 right
sw04033-A_012174-013101 right and the news too it just doesn't um cover a- that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
sw04033-A_013101-013794 and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
sw04033-A_013794-014805 um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
sw04033-A_014805-015454 it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
sw04033-A_016641-016831 right i
sw04033-A_017038-017319 i used to read every month a reader's digest
sw04033-A_017319-018656 but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
sw04033-A_018656-020150 i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on [laughter] not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
sw04033-A_020150-020288 but
sw04033-A_020938-021059 right
sw04033-A_021059-021172 [noise]
sw04033-A_021172-022278 [noise] well i um they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on
sw04033-A_022278-022801 outside of texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas
sw04033-A_022801-023691 that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
sw04033-A_024039-024841 [laughter] yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics [laughter]
sw04033-A_025694-026090 i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah
sw04033-A_026090-026323 [laughter]
sw04033-A_026323-026461 yeah
sw04033-A_027664-028921 right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but
sw04033-B_000312-001281 well duri- see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
sw04033-B_001281-002315 and i don't watch t._v. as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um
sw04033-B_002315-002688 i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
sw04033-B_003081-003368 that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
sw04033-B_003368-003954 people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
sw04033-B_004125-004262 uh-huh
sw04033-B_004724-004852 yeah
sw04033-B_005314-005955 do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the mcneil lehrer hour
sw04033-B_005955-006105 oh really
sw04033-B_006285-007033 uh-huh oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public t._v. so it's kind of different
sw04033-B_007133-007411 i think i think the uh
sw04033-B_007411-008342 i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
sw04033-B_008342-008841 they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
sw04033-B_009264-009399 yeah
sw04033-B_009945-010099 yeah exactly
sw04033-B_010555-011532 uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say
sw04033-B_011532-012254 you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it
sw04033-B_013058-013233 yeah [noise]
sw04033-B_013756-013889 yeah
sw04033-B_015378-016717 what kind of uh see i subscribe to like science news and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
sw04033-B_016717-017111 but other than that i don't really r- i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
sw04033-B_017252-017388 uh-huh
sw04033-B_018321-018479 oh yeah
sw04033-B_019197-019323 yeah
sw04033-B_019432-019571 [laughter]
sw04033-B_019814-019945 yeah
sw04033-B_020162-021005 well i remember dur- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t._v. on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
sw04033-B_021005-021151 but uh
sw04033-B_021267-021390 [vocalized-noise]
sw04033-B_022749-022887 yeah
sw04033-B_023489-024234 if they reported every m- if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh
sw04033-B_024589-025833 oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o- on the olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
sw04033-B_025833-026340 oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh
sw04033-B_026340-026950 i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over
sw04033-B_026950-027904 i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
sw04033-B_028708-028973 yeah it seems like
sw04033-B_028973-029875 i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or [vocalized-noise] if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s- some channel for it but i don't have cable
sw04034-A_000000-000311 uh do you have any recycling going on in your community
sw04034-A_001428-001538 uh-huh
sw04034-A_002300-002398 oh
sw04034-A_003705-003801 uh-huh
sw04034-A_004159-004434 so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but
sw04034-A_004857-004977 oh really
sw04034-A_006609-007053 it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will
sw04034-A_007053-007265 recycle magazines
sw04034-A_007367-007658 the glossy magazines yes
sw04034-A_007658-007784 uh
sw04034-A_007784-008025 and then they charge you for the service
sw04034-A_008853-008987 uh-huh
sw04034-A_008987-009292 was this something that was voted on or uh
sw04034-A_009447-009637 hum by the city council or something
sw04034-A_009637-009752 uh-huh
sw04034-A_010241-010330 uh-huh
sw04034-A_012175-012290 um
sw04034-A_012463-012654 they'd charge for it [vocalized-noise]
sw04034-A_012654-012777 whether
sw04034-A_012777-012951 you take advantage of it or not
sw04034-A_013514-013630 uh-huh
sw04034-A_014076-014184 uh-huh
sw04034-A_014619-014728 um-hum
sw04034-A_015614-015757 right
sw04034-A_015921-016085 well we have uh
sw04034-A_016188-017548 some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in [vocalized-noise] our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines
sw04034-A_017548-018398 uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
sw04034-A_018398-018621 and uh cardboard
sw04034-A_018621-018845 and it used to be free
sw04034-A_018845-019183 for a few weeks then they
sw04034-A_019183-019885 sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations
sw04034-A_019885-020003 and i
sw04034-A_020003-020851 i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now
sw04034-A_020851-021012 uh
sw04034-A_021012-021192 and i [vocalized-noise]
sw04034-A_021192-021700 i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out
sw04034-A_021700-021939 so it may work out monetarily
sw04034-A_021939-022199 okay for us to be charged for it
sw04034-A_022199-022726 uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash
sw04034-A_023095-023396 right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people
sw04034-A_023396-023594 this is another this is uh
sw04034-A_023594-023943 um carl carl's recycling
sw04034-A_023943-024459 and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh
sw04034-A_024459-024678 private and nonmandatory
sw04034-A_024678-024917 and people just put things out on the curb
sw04034-A_024917-025224 um he's competing with some uh
sw04034-A_025224-026049 very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables
sw04034-A_026049-026224 so it's uh
sw04034-A_026916-027018 um-hum
sw04034-A_027836-028267 yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh
sw04034-A_028267-028760 they have all this used newsprint that people don't want
sw04034-A_028760-028895 right
sw04034-B_000241-000634 uh yes we do we've started out with uh um
sw04034-B_000634-001294 all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up uh lots of
sw04034-B_001294-001490 different kinds of waste
sw04034-B_001490-001667 and they uh
sw04034-B_001788-002267 uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times
sw04034-B_002267-002369 uh
sw04034-B_002369-002679 and uh so
sw04034-B_002679-003340 now you have all kinds of of uh things that they didn't use to pick up like magazines and uh
sw04034-B_003340-003598 various forms of of uh
sw04034-B_003598-004004 glass tin and things like that
sw04034-B_004004-004128 uh
sw04034-B_004398-005861 well no [vocalized-noise] in a a long time ago you didn't uh they didn't pick up any of that and and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately they've gone in to it in a big way and they've said the uh they have to pick up
sw04034-B_005861-005999 i think it's
sw04034-B_005999-006687 uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up
sw04034-B_007476-007606 yes
sw04034-B_008001-008251 yes well now these so they're
sw04034-B_008251-008962 we're being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people
sw04034-B_009332-009532 uh
sw04034-B_009532-009888 the city council did it they decided that that there was
sw04034-B_009888-010010 portland is kind of a
sw04034-B_010126-010499 ecology minded area and so they uh
sw04034-B_010499-010861 uh although there're some complaints because the
sw04034-B_010861-011448 there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the
sw04034-B_011448-012231 the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh
sw04034-B_012231-012374 uh
sw04034-B_012546-012727 they charge
sw04034-B_012888-013577 much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing
sw04034-B_013577-014119 in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now
sw04034-B_014119-014652 because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now
sw04034-B_014652-015307 so they can you know it's the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can
sw04034-B_015307-015663 they don't have to work very hard at at keeping costs down
sw04034-B_015800-015974 so how about your area
sw04034-B_022750-023095 of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up
sw04034-B_023351-023481 oh i see what you're saying
sw04034-B_026174-026632 the thing that that uh has another thing that's been in the press here has been
sw04034-B_026632-027444 that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the uh
sw04034-B_027567-027829 how should i say it the market can't absorb
sw04034-B_027829-027969 all of the uh
sw04034-B_028838-029486 right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market it's piling up uh
sw04034-B_029606-029891 i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from
sw04035-A_000000-000167 [noise] how do you feel about capital punishment
sw04035-A_000392-000534 yeah
sw04035-A_000534-000718 [noise] for what reasons

sw04035-A_002153-003167 [noise] yeah definitely yeah i- i [noise] i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the econ- for economic reasons because i- i don't think it acts as a deterrent
sw04035-A_003167-004503 [noise] and i don't think that um [noise] and and and for what i've what i've read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed them for the en- end you know

sw04035-A_026004-027356 you know it really bothers me that in historical cases you know where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know and when they're you know on death row and and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them [laughter]
sw04035-A_027356-027642 and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of
sw04035-A_029302-029442 um-hum
sw04035-A_029442-029645 oh like in texas
sw04035-B_000000-000092 [noise]
sw04035-B_000092-000558 um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it
sw04035-B_000661-001674 uh i think that they make a lo- the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um
sw04035-B_001674-002212 you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late
sw04035-B_004456-005425 yeah it dose because because of uh [noise] the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should
sw04035-B_005425-006216 but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the supreme court
sw04035-B_006216-007195 um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the supreme court when they used to be
sw04035-B_007195-008566 so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh
sw04035-B_008566-008993 down in tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row
sw04035-B_009102-009895 [noise] yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um [noise] let's say um
sw04035-B_009895-011074 cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convic- certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway
sw04035-B_011074-011551 i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't
sw04035-B_011863-012050 yeah so
sw04035-B_012286-012917 no huh um they do in georgia right yeah they
sw04035-B_013533-014203 right well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that
sw04035-B_014203-015015 just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the
sw04035-B_015015-016279 the bottom line was that uh [noise] what was i saying uh nobody in tennessee has been con- has been executed since nineteen
sw04035-B_016279-016780 uh sev- uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and un-
sw04035-B_016780-017994 yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials
sw04035-B_017994-018405 um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not
sw04035-B_018405-019211 um then then that's okay they can it it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have
sw04035-B_019211-019900 um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and
sw04035-B_019900-020362 yeah in tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them yeah
sw04035-B_022281-022409 yeah
sw04035-B_022656-023935 yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy gary gilmore did right
sw04035-B_023935-024105 you know the guy
sw04035-B_024268-024965 right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um
sw04035-B_024965-025809 yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in dea- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want
sw04035-B_025809-026141 [vocalized-noise] which is basically what that is but
sw04035-B_027314-027534 yeah sure
sw04035-B_027534-028762 i did some i did some en- environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the f. d. a. they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug
sw04035-B_028996-029971 it was a drug that was that they were using for the death penalty and they tr- to right they tried to get it proved safe before the f. d. a. would approve it [laughter]
sw04036-A_000000-000036 [noise]
sw04036-A_000036-000333 i think that uh one uh advantage
sw04036-A_000333-001277 of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um
sw04036-A_001277-002204 and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
sw04036-A_002204-002615 is very unreasonable in some way that uh
sw04036-A_002615-002872 you uh would have a problem
sw04036-A_002872-003279 uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
sw04036-A_003423-003708 have you ever served on a jury before
sw04036-A_003811-003892 oh
sw04036-A_004047-004268 uh what sorts of cases were they
sw04036-A_005100-005337 so were they criminal or civil
sw04036-A_005507-005640 oh okay
sw04036-A_005742-006277 what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
sw04036-A_006967-007083 yeah
sw04036-A_007634-007783 so did it become
sw04036-A_008040-008171 yeah
sw04036-A_008371-008477 ah
sw04036-A_008585-008670 oh
sw04036-A_008670-009079 but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
sw04036-A_009079-009425 what was what was the other case that was also civil
sw04036-A_010074-010197 yeah
sw04036-A_010339-010496 oh didn't really even count
sw04036-A_010496-011251 yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um
sw04036-A_011251-011743 and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i
sw04036-A_011743-012246 declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
sw04036-A_012514-013256 yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i- i haven't
sw04036-A_013256-013644 um one one thing that i- i think is um
sw04036-A_013644-014688 you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
sw04036-A_014688-014943 uh especially sort of
sw04036-A_014943-015148 ow well
sw04036-A_015561-015700 [noise] the
sw04036-A_015997-016248 ah but you thought it turned out pretty well
sw04036-A_017060-017193 yeah
sw04036-A_017567-018067 oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
sw04036-A_018067-019082 hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or
sw04036-A_019799-020078 so it worked it did end up working out pretty well
sw04036-A_020078-020657 the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh
sw04036-A_020657-021625 whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
sw04036-A_021625-022393 you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of
sw04036-A_022393-023125 uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um
sw04036-A_023125-024085 if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
sw04036-A_024611-025172 in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so
sw04036-A_025742-025846 yeah
sw04036-A_026049-026163 ah
sw04036-A_026163-026745 oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments
sw04036-A_026914-027043 yeah
sw04036-A_027482-027764 ah so they were suing to get it back
sw04036-A_027989-028155 ah
sw04036-A_028155-028314 yeah
sw04036-A_029049-029185 uh
sw04036-B_000000-000051 [noise]
sw04036-B_001084-001250 definitely
sw04036-B_003238-003409 um-hum
sw04036-B_003570-003802 uh i have twice
sw04036-B_003802-004072 it was pretty wild experience
sw04036-B_004224-005100 they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
sw04036-B_005383-005757 they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal
sw04036-B_006241-007034 uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people
sw04036-B_007034-007493 so it was they and uh the one changed his vote
sw04036-B_007493-007673 at the end
sw04036-B_007673-008651 so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so
sw04036-B_008998-009131 right
sw04036-B_009397-009711 the the uh other case was just traffic
sw04036-B_009711-010352 the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly
sw04036-B_010352-010531 go through so
sw04036-B_011100-011226 yeah
sw04036-B_012188-012565 yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
sw04036-B_014619-014754 it [vocalized-noise]
sw04036-B_014754-015001 [vocalized-noise] i wouldn't think that it does
sw04036-B_015001-015570 i mean from from my e- from what i experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't
sw04036-B_015570-016174 didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it
sw04036-B_016174-016755 yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and
sw04036-B_016755-017196 it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so
sw04036-B_017196-017690 i'm not used to it not being organized and i just a- assumed that it would have been
sw04036-B_017806-017945 that's
sw04036-B_017945-018159 that's about what it was [noise]
sw04036-B_019004-019633 yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it
sw04036-B_019633-019960 turn out the way it should have so
sw04036-B_019960-020197 yeah it ended up working all right
sw04036-B_021557-021688 yes
sw04036-B_024020-024443 uh i don't think that they they they educate them enough to
sw04036-B_024443-024684 to really know what's going on
sw04036-B_025014-025747 yeah [vocalized-noise] the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer
sw04036-B_025747-026289 that which was assumingly their property it was on his property
sw04036-B_026529-026649 right
sw04036-B_026751-026969 so they came to get it
sw04036-B_026969-027566 and then when they came to get it well i- it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off
sw04036-B_027696-028060 so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
sw04036-B_028060-028250 so they left it there
sw04036-B_028250-028452 and then when
sw04036-B_028452-029107 they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
sw04036-B_029107-029421 so they were suing him for the money and
sw04036-B_029421-029741 you know there's no way they could because it's
sw04036-B_029741-029962 it was the moving company [vocalized-noise]
sw04037-A_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04037-A_000039-000691 uh greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in indiana don't you have the the death penalty
sw04037-A_001101-001192 uh-huh
sw04037-A_001425-001528 uh-huh
sw04037-A_002044-002166 um-hum
sw04037-A_003399-003521 right
sw04037-A_004633-004754 um-hum
sw04037-A_004984-005948 um-hum uh i- i tend to agree with you uh [noise] i've changed my views over uh e- even within the last few years uh to be honest [noise] uh
sw04037-A_005948-006017 [noise]
sw04037-A_006017-006575 uh when i was in coll- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
sw04037-A_006575-007479 and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh ho- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
sw04037-A_007479-007727 but [noise] the uh
sw04037-A_007727-008752 the more now i live in [vocalized-noise] downtown dallas and i uh [laughter] you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
sw04037-A_008752-009119 person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
sw04037-A_009119-009188 [noise]
sw04037-A_009188-009400 i think that [noise] maybe a
sw04037-A_009400-010278 a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder
sw04037-A_010479-010677 yeah uh i-
sw04037-A_010677-011660 yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i- uh i- i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
sw04037-A_011660-011746 uh
sw04037-A_011746-011853 [noise]
sw04037-A_011853-013057 i also [noise] uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh
sw04037-A_013057-013744 big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example th- these people need to be uh eliminated uh
sw04037-A_013744-014431 from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh
sw04037-A_014431-014749 uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh
sw04037-A_014749-014945 create another power structure [laughter]
sw04037-A_014945-015049 you know the
sw04037-A_015557-015677 uh-huh
sw04037-A_016305-016427 right
sw04037-A_016573-016694 right

sw04037-A_018752-018823 [noise]
sw04037-A_018823-019721 do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital [vocalized-noise] capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced
sw04037-A_021012-021149 um-hum
sw04037-A_021567-021690 right
sw04037-A_022128-022309 that's true yeah
sw04037-A_022432-022553 right
sw04037-A_023664-023783 uh-huh
sw04037-A_023783-023913 uh-huh
sw04037-A_025836-026024 right
sw04037-A_026024-026411 sure yeah i understand i understand your point
sw04037-A_026411-027424 yeah uh of course you know with uh with with dahlmer now uh y- you realize that ohi- i think it's ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty
sw04037-A_027424-027511 yeah
sw04037-A_027511-027598 [noise]
sw04037-A_027598-027978 [noise] so uh that was a curious case i
sw04037-A_027978-028549 uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
sw04037-A_028720-029207 uh well here in texas we uh i think even even this last week
sw04037-A_029207-029879 uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
sw04037-B_000000-000048 [noise]
sw04037-B_000642-001123 yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often [noise] but we do have it
sw04037-B_001123-001503 i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
sw04037-B_001503-002154 uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
sw04037-B_002154-003450 seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
sw04037-B_003558-004683 uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten la- years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
sw04037-B_004683-005060 just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
sw04037-B_006488-006610 uh-huh
sw04037-B_007411-007538 right
sw04037-B_008062-008187 right
sw04037-B_009072-009198 right
sw04037-B_010203-010757 that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that wh- which seems pretty sensible
sw04037-B_011596-011734 right
sw04037-B_012536-012709 right yeah
sw04037-B_013367-013497 uh-huh
sw04037-B_013656-013785 uh-huh
sw04037-B_014862-015192 yeah you're you're right there uh
sw04037-B_015192-015723 i ju- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
sw04037-B_015723-016639 y- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
sw04037-B_016639-017536 i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
sw04037-B_017536-018481 to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
sw04037-B_019681-021083 well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
sw04037-B_021083-021607 and in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
sw04037-B_021607-022801 and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing god [laughter] which is n- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld
sw04037-B_022801-023850 uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
