sw04193-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04193-B_000049-000371 so um i pretty much read the paper
sw04193-B_000371-000970 yeah r- i catch the news sometimes uh but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work
sw04193-B_000970-001596 uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
sw04193-B_001703-001798 [noise]
sw04193-B_002596-003198 yeah i- i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because i don't always call my broker and things
sw04193-B_003198-003874 but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon
sw04193-B_003874-004698 uh so we listen to n._p._r. a lot and we hear we listen to morning edition in the morning and fresh air and all things considered in the afternoon
sw04193-B_004698-005445 so uh and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and
sw04193-B_006246-007403 yeah i- i'd like to get you know things little s- a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise clinton won in the south you know
sw04193-B_007403-007900 you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day
sw04193-B_007900-008049 um
sw04193-B_008049-008670 but you know i- i find especially n._p._r. is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch c._n._n. a lot when i got cable
sw04193-B_008670-009278 because uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting
sw04193-B_009278-010446 uh our local papers like the boston globe you know where you we have you know you've got the boston globe which is extreme in one way and the manchester union leader which like supports buchanan and things
sw04193-B_010446-011701 so between the two of them you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the boston phoenix weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting
sw04193-B_012875-014345 yeah and and i- i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there
sw04193-B_014345-015497 uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks
sw04193-B_015497-015598 um
sw04193-B_015598-015849 i really think that um
sw04193-B_015849-017100 you know you have to go to some uh place like n._p._r. that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news
sw04193-B_017100-017698 and the other nice thing about my local uh n._p._r. station is they also got monitor radio and the b._b._c.
sw04193-B_017698-018170 through yeah they do [vocalized-noise] this this is basically our all news a._m. station 10a
sw04193-B_018170-019368 so what you get is you get uh they they've kind of picked up so you get like five a._m. they give b._b._c. then you've got [vocalized-noise] uh you've got morning edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the b._b._c.
sw04193-B_019368-020526 then in the afternoon you get uh the npr's talk show and then you've got uh fresh air at four all things considered till seven then you get market place then they give you b._b._c. again
sw04193-B_020526-021402 so it's really you know f- they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources
sw04193-B_021402-022271 and you know it's kind of neat to see how the b._b._c. reports things differently you know th- they've got a much different view like reporting south africa and the middle east
sw04193-B_022271-023080 um i find that n._p._r. and the b._b._c. has a much more global view than like a._b._c. or one of the us ones
sw04193-B_023201-024149 but you know because you know i find that um a the the american uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric
sw04193-B_024149-024300 where
sw04193-B_024300-025075 you know they they they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not not just us lucky people
sw04193-B_025075-025199 um
sw04193-B_025301-026747 so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know i'll i'll glance through the boston globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the uh like the milford cabinet uh the national telegraph to get the really local news
sw04193-B_026747-027299 yeah it's like the globe gives you like regional news uh and boston news
sw04193-B_027299-027647 like my fiance is telling me the globe sucks uh
sw04193-B_027647-029098 and and then you get like uh you know the uh the telegraph and the cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the t- in the in the cabinet because we went to the school board meeting
sw04193-B_029098-029946 so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage
sw04194-A_000000-000950 [noise] i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up
sw04194-A_000950-001948 um i'd started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on
sw04194-A_001948-003277 and got it all set up and then kind of got it tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were
sw04194-A_003277-003519 i don't think i've looked at that thing in a year and a half
sw04194-A_005227-005374 um
sw04194-A_006175-006303 yeah
sw04194-A_007079-007249 [vocalized-noise]
sw04194-A_007749-008968 yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it
sw04194-A_009075-009550 well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where there's a lot of
sw04194-A_009550-010350 uh fri- frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things
sw04194-A_010350-010949 it's hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff
sw04194-A_010949-012231 reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them all and tape them on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed
sw04194-A_012231-012702 and uh man that that ended it in about a week um [noise]
sw04194-A_012702-012999 yeah very similar procedure
sw04194-A_013549-013949 [laughter]
sw04194-A_015247-015723 really that has got to be one of the worst problems we've got here today
sw04194-A_015723-016264 and it's hardly considered you know here it is uh a an elec- election year and you hardly hear anything about it
sw04194-A_016264-016923 especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us
sw04194-A_017671-017972 yeah yep
sw04194-A_020344-020499 [laughter]
sw04194-A_020901-021199 um yep
sw04194-A_021380-021799 [laughter]
sw04194-A_022346-022744 yeah colleges and education in many ways
sw04194-A_023299-023623 [laughter]
sw04194-A_023850-024599 i haven't resorted to um peanut butter but i have had to go to long periods of ragu and um pasta
sw04194-A_024897-025323 ooh ooh actually we've got a stash of that we had a cat but it ran away
sw04194-A_025402-025680 um so we've got a good bit
sw04194-A_025680-026220 we've got a dog now and it'll eat the cat food though that's its treat at the end of the day
sw04194-A_026220-026905 well he's a puppy i don't think he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet
sw04194-A_026905-027404 it's good food fortunately that's cheap and it fits in the budget twenty five cents a can
sw04194-A_027777-028600 well i've been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah that's uh it hasn't been real successful but he barks real well
sw04194-A_029275-029450 uh uh
sw04194-A_029450-029895 [laughter]
sw04194-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04194-B_001699-001899 [laughter]
sw04194-B_003398-003637 [laughter]
sw04194-B_003637-004473 uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time
sw04194-B_004473-005300 and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it
sw04194-B_005300-006223 because to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along
sw04194-B_006223-007272 uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years we're all of a sudden uh it's irs time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money
sw04194-B_007272-007778 but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head
sw04194-B_008898-009100 how does it pay off for you
sw04194-B_010901-011073 right
sw04194-B_011280-011578 [laughter]
sw04194-B_012478-012611 [noise]
sw04194-B_012611-012827 and the same thing for the budget huh
sw04194-B_012948-013646 interesting i- i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous
sw04194-B_013646-014900 and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to congress uh
sw04194-B_014900-015150 uh in terms of actually considering a budget
sw04194-B_015150-015225 [laughter]
sw04194-B_015225-015325 and staying with it
sw04194-B_015325-015476 [noise]
sw04194-B_015676-015847 right
sw04194-B_016174-016374 right right
sw04194-B_016700-016849 yep
sw04194-B_016849-017329 and so i think we as a society tend to have
sw04194-B_017329-017899 uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean we're having fun
sw04194-B_017899-018869 and so i guess i'm kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent
sw04194-B_018869-020299 actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of february
sw04194-B_020299-020920 uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating
sw04194-B_020920-021000 [laughter]
sw04194-B_021000-022400 uh i it was called subsist on peanut butter and jelly for the the month and at one point some girls in a sorority that i kn- uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back room and fed me a salad
sw04194-B_022400-022500 [noise]
sw04194-B_022500-022622 [vocalized-noise]
sw04194-B_022622-023926 you bet you bet i think the reason why they did it was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of [laughter] disease like that
sw04194-B_024421-024700 [laughter]
sw04194-B_024700-024900 well at least you're not down to cat food
sw04194-B_024900-025099 uh
sw04194-B_025278-025450 oh no
sw04194-B_026029-026299 sounds like a dog with a complex
sw04194-B_026299-026499 [laughter]
sw04194-B_026828-026977 uh great
sw04194-B_026977-027149 [laughter]
sw04194-B_027298-027828 yeah right right well as long as you're not teaching him how to meow or something like that
sw04194-B_028025-028200 oh really
sw04194-B_028549-029100 uh reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a pig to sing
sw04194-B_029100-029549 the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig
sw04194-B_029549-029895 [laughter]
sw04195-A_000008-000150 how old are your kids
sw04195-A_000250-000374 oh yeah
sw04195-A_000600-000772 oh okay
sw04195-A_001148-001274 [vocalized-noise]
sw04195-A_001399-001601 that's a hard task
sw04195-A_001880-002099 right
sw04195-A_002298-003300 yeah that's that's fantastic yeah um a lot of times well i guess the majority of their of their early growing up years they had a full family right
sw04195-A_003499-003849 oh so he traveled around a bit and was on duty
sw04195-A_003849-003998 okay
sw04195-A_004175-004947 yeah i- i find myself comparing it to my sisters because both of them have been divorced um one had one child and the other had three
sw04195-A_005380-005514 good job
sw04195-A_005514-005649 [laughter]
sw04195-A_006277-006398 [laughter]
sw04195-A_006398-006749 that's a euphemism huh that's a euphemism huh
sw04195-A_006749-006897 [laughter]
sw04195-A_007648-007799 um-hum
sw04195-A_007999-008149 right
sw04195-A_008429-008599 right
sw04195-A_008998-009149 um-hum
sw04195-A_009449-009576 yeah
sw04195-A_009680-010149 great that sounds good sounds like there's some quality time being spent there
sw04195-A_010874-011248 right it's are you calling from the south

sw04195-A_016330-016447 right
sw04195-A_016447-017946 a lot of people frown on that just on on t._v. in general but i don't know i- i think my own personal opinion is that it it helps to instill a sense of values and moral as long as it could be ex- explained and as long as there's good monitoring going on
sw04195-A_018147-018300 right
sw04195-A_018818-018972 um-hum

sw04195-A_023976-025349 that's good i my sister my closest sister is the same way in terms of day care pretty much to where she really tries to not have them in day care because you tend to pick up bad habits that way and oth- other people
sw04195-A_025596-026925 right you don't know what kind of moral people are inflicting on your children and things like that so yeah that's a good thing i'm i'm myself am am not married but am beg your pardon

sw04195-A_027549-028622 uh right now i'm i'm getting closer to marriage and things are getting very serious and we're talking about these kind of issues and things so good to hear a viewpoint from someone who is actually in the situation
sw04195-A_028622-028746 um
sw04195-A_029173-029298 yeah

sw04195-B_005631-006529 i uh have always been home with them and then when my husband decided he wanted to be free and uh left i

sw04195-B_013698-013877 um
sw04195-B_013978-014373 pretty much pretty much because we've had pretty weather
sw04195-B_014373-014524 and um
sw04195-B_014633-015047 oh it's been awful lately it's rained a lot

sw04195-B_017646-017826 right
sw04195-B_017826-018529 because my children know what they can watch and what they can't and if they see something that does not
sw04195-B_018529-019097 sound right from the way they've been raised they will say something about it

sw04195-B_028149-028298 um-hum
sw04195-B_028598-029904 yeah i- i think it's important to really think really hard before you get married and before you have kids and and when you make that commitment to stand by it not to a few years later go well
sw04196-A_000000-000348 [noise] steve yeah how do you keep up on current affairs

sw04196-A_002701-002849 uh-huh
sw04196-A_002849-003048 that's a good way of looking at it
sw04196-A_003248-003370 uh-huh
sw04196-A_005100-005399 slightly liberal to the left or to the right
sw04196-A_005527-005679 what'd you say
sw04196-A_006078-006249 [vocalized-noise]
sw04196-A_006527-006699 i see huh
sw04196-A_006827-006979 uh-huh
sw04196-A_007899-008001 uh-huh
sw04196-A_008149-008274 uh-huh
sw04196-A_008274-009015 well i get my uh news from really from all the sources uh i will say probably radio is uh
sw04196-A_009015-010300 is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news uh on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the t._v. for
sw04196-A_010300-011272 for news and i take two newspaper uh the local city newspaper here in portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the manchester union leader so uh
sw04196-A_011272-012048 you know that's that's how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if it's real important you're going to hear about it from other people besides
sw04196-A_013148-013350 um-hum
sw04196-A_015150-015297 right
sw04196-A_016399-016577 uh-huh
sw04196-A_017073-017249 no
sw04196-A_017249-017600 but you do but you do i- i take it
sw04196-A_017730-017900 uh-huh
sw04196-A_019096-019247 uh-huh
sw04196-A_020049-020200 i see
sw04196-A_020999-021150 um-hum
sw04196-A_022100-022250 um-hum
sw04196-A_022647-023925 well we have a sports interaction with quebec mainly uh montreal uh the teams there uh both baseball and with uh with hockey of course and with quebec and uh quebec city
sw04196-A_023925-025047 and also uh one of the uh t- t._v. stations uh from canada is on the cable system in this area uh from sherbrook
sw04196-A_025047-025550 so uh we we do have some news from from canada from time to time
sw04196-A_026720-026976 do you have c._n._n. do you have c._n._n.
sw04196-A_027149-027477 that can be an important source of news international
sw04196-A_027848-027998 um-hum
sw04196-A_028875-029003 right
sw04196-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04196-B_000249-001602 well frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um
sw04196-B_001602-002950 i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um
sw04196-B_002950-003600 [noise] that's i guess that's primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh
sw04196-B_003600-004779 do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know
sw04196-B_004779-005223 you end up and you say well yeah okay and you
sw04196-B_005328-005528 uh
sw04196-B_005671-005896 oh i would say maybe it's
sw04196-B_005896-007000 a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh it's a fairly liberal minded um
sw04196-B_007100-007799 but you know it's uh you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of uh
sw04196-B_007799-008252 a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened
sw04196-B_011898-013229 right yeah i- i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide
sw04196-B_013229-013625 um here i guess really we're dealing with uh
sw04196-B_013726-013950 the regions being
sw04196-B_014050-014673 i- i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's uh
sw04196-B_014673-015218 several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved
sw04196-B_015218-016447 and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international
sw04196-B_016447-017199 and and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much north dakota news
sw04196-B_017199-017428 um you know so
sw04196-B_017549-018219 uh w- we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of north dakota we
sw04196-B_018219-019171 uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between north dakota and saskatchewan
sw04196-B_019171-020149 and uh it's not hardly an current event as such but um minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down
sw04196-B_020149-021400 um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and uh so then it has
sw04196-B_021400-022600 anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized toronto montreal ottawa vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh
sw04196-B_023698-023852 um-hum
sw04196-B_024748-024875 oh yeah
sw04196-B_024980-025099 um-hum
sw04196-B_025449-025599 yeah
sw04196-B_025599-026900 it's uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three detroit stations and we've got three saskatchewan stations with
sw04196-B_026900-027328 uh yes we do we also have c._n._n. which
sw04196-B_027328-028448 yes uh yeah i- i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh
sw04196-B_028448-029249 so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a
sw04196-B_029249-029946 regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh
sw04197-A_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04197-A_000049-001200 all right um [laughter] well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it
sw04197-A_001200-002449 um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used
sw04197-A_002449-002599 so
sw04197-A_005249-005497 um-hum right
sw04197-A_005844-006147 yeah i think i think
sw04197-A_006275-006449 um-hum
sw04197-A_006802-006999 right right
sw04197-A_007599-007772 [laughter]
sw04197-A_007772-007877 [noise]
sw04197-A_008150-009300 exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs
sw04197-A_009300-010143 y- well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like uh yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh
sw04197-A_010143-010196 [laughter]
sw04197-A_010196-011050 killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um
sw04197-A_011050-012180 i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level
sw04197-A_012180-013049 uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um
sw04197-A_013049-013600 and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation
sw04197-A_013600-014868 um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um
sw04197-A_014868-015800 but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so
sw04197-A_016046-017397 um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um
sw04197-A_017397-018248 why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on
sw04197-A_021750-021899 um-hum
sw04197-A_022001-022148 [laughter]
sw04197-A_023549-023700 [laughter]
sw04197-A_023800-024149 yes oh yeah i agree exactly um
sw04197-A_024500-024649 um-hum
sw04197-A_024898-025548 oh yeah yeah i well i think we're seeing a major decline um but
sw04197-A_025548-026049 um i'm i'm not sure how that relates directly to taxation um
sw04197-A_026049-026229 [laughter]
sw04197-A_026229-026549 uh trying to stay on the topic here [laughter]
sw04197-A_026977-027127 right
sw04197-A_027377-027528 yeah
sw04197-A_027528-027747 [laughter]
sw04197-A_028572-028747 hum
sw04197-A_029299-029448 um-hum
sw04197-A_029849-029968 right
sw04197-B_000000-000015 [noise]
sw04197-B_000015-000127 okay you first
sw04197-B_000127-000295 [noise] [laughter]
sw04197-B_002447-003174 yeah i- i agree i don't think it's uh effectively used um as far as the amount um
sw04197-B_003174-003524 i'm never really sure about the amount because there's so much that
sw04197-B_003524-004450 needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but
sw04197-B_004450-005446 there's a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily
sw04197-B_005446-005926 and uh i- i agree with you that things are just not used effectively
sw04197-B_005926-006948 and we you know people don't want to live within their means we've got huge deficits that doesn't appear to you know nobody's talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all
sw04197-B_007054-008325 and i was amazed in the state of the union address and bush i don't think mentioned the d. word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and i'm like okay where is the money coming from
sw04197-B_008325-008450 yeah
sw04197-B_008779-008897 um-hum
sw04197-B_009526-009727 right [vocalized-noise]
sw04197-B_010026-010170 yeah
sw04197-B_011222-011350 um-hum
sw04197-B_012149-012299 um-hum
sw04197-B_013548-013750 yeah yeah
sw04197-B_014726-014873 um-hum
sw04197-B_015547-015700 yeah yeah
sw04197-B_015798-016145 and round most of those are state administered aren't they
sw04197-B_016277-016403 um-hum
sw04197-B_016779-016924 okay
sw04197-B_017646-017827 right right
sw04197-B_018150-019550 right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about states like mississippi and louisiana that always tend to have and ar- and arkansas significantly with clinton running but it
sw04197-B_019550-020749 states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but
sw04197-B_020749-021148 still their economy never really got off the ground and
sw04197-B_021148-022349 you know it it i don't know i don't live in louisiana or any of those states and i don't ever think that i will but so it's really none of my business but it's like something you know i- i it's
sw04197-B_022349-023603 i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but
sw04197-B_023603-023975 you know the the rest of us in the country at least
sw04197-B_023975-025099 and then i yeah i know there's plenty of people in california here who don't have enough education either i mean you know that's always the a major political football problem in any state the education system
sw04197-B_025299-025428 yeah
sw04197-B_025927-026149 yeah that's true that's true
sw04197-B_026149-026271 [laughter]
sw04197-B_026424-026519 [noise]
sw04197-B_026519-027440 yeah well i don't think it really matters anyway because it you know they'll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction
sw04197-B_027440-028247 but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isn't really
sw04197-B_028247-028873 it it isn't taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that
sw04197-B_028873-029968 [vocalized-noise] people people don't have an idea that the whole we're all in this together and in the eighties that wasn't the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of
sw04198-A_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04198-A_000032-001027 oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because of because of the latest check writing scandal [laughter]
sw04198-A_001027-001700 [laughter] i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund
sw04198-A_001700-001999 uh i don't know what do you think
sw04198-A_004245-004548 [laughter]
sw04198-A_005375-006800 well it sort of i- i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manag- managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to
sw04198-A_006800-007224 uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals
sw04198-A_007224-007400 so
sw04198-A_008125-008250 um-hum
sw04198-A_009174-009345 um-hum
sw04198-A_011641-011849 um-hum
sw04198-A_016467-017400 um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i- i don't know i- i uh i rather think we're not going to see the end of the deficit for some time
sw04198-A_017400-018800 although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall i'm not sure they're they're kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now
sw04198-A_018800-019497 uh running against washington so that's so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know
sw04198-A_019497-020200 trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking that's kind of strange i don't think they're going to
sw04198-A_020200-021185 i don't think i don't know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially
sw04198-A_021185-021999 you know we had robert k. dornam who's been a gap fly of a lot of uh he's he's been uh
sw04198-A_021999-022300 uh orange county's um
sw04198-A_022430-023528 uh [laughter] i don't know i embarrassment i guess he's he's really terrible they um never voted down a a weapon's package ever
sw04198-A_023528-024277 and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that [vocalized-noise] that one check that he he uh he
sw04198-A_024277-025698 he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a madonna for his for his for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny
sw04198-A_026896-027497 yeah yeah i very much so um you know
sw04198-A_027726-027950 um-hum
sw04198-A_028450-028622 yeah
sw04198-A_028875-029426 do you think it's because other people because people are spending other people money they got
sw04198-B_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04198-B_001647-001776 okay
sw04198-B_002099-002604 well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to
sw04198-B_002604-003381 uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up
sw04198-B_003381-004318 and [noise] seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization
sw04198-B_004318-004422 [noise]
sw04198-B_004422-005405 centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency
sw04198-B_007098-007281 [noise]
sw04198-B_007281-008150 well i think one of the problem is again isn't really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect
sw04198-B_008150-008474 further removed cause and effect get the the uh
sw04198-B_008474-008815 more problems you have i remember an incident um
sw04198-B_008815-008918 [noise]
sw04198-B_008918-009229 back when i was in dallas
sw04198-B_009331-010000 where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh
sw04198-B_010000-010129 [noise]
sw04198-B_010129-010748 i don't remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that
sw04198-B_010748-011750 that they they wouldn't really have to pay for them i think they'd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest
sw04198-B_011750-012498 and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to
sw04198-B_012498-013849 uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government
sw04198-B_013849-015078 and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why
sw04198-B_015078-015199 um
sw04198-B_015376-016048 centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have
sw04198-B_016048-016500 um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it
sw04198-B_019400-019554 hum
sw04198-B_025597-027054 well i think it's easy to you know once you get in the position of power it's easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying

sw04199-B_013777-014171 [laughter] yeah that's right when i graduated yeah
sw04199-B_014400-014898 not i went to one football game down here in florida i watched miami dolphins
sw04199-B_014898-015997 well [laughter] actually terrible they built that joe robbie stadium there in uh in miami and it's not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south florida it just it just comes down in buckets
sw04199-B_015997-016598 and that particular sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel
sw04199-B_016598-017700 all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there they've got little drains but they don't they don't drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees
sw04199-B_017700-018200 and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold
sw04199-B_018200-019201 and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them and putting them over their heads and stuff
sw04199-B_019201-020146 but the but the that that game they played the pittsburgh steelers and miami was beating them at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game
sw04199-B_020146-020949 so my my football experience down here in florida has been very bad when i was in michigan i loved to go watch u. of m. play uh i played high school football
sw04199-B_020949-021800 you know so i you know that's that's why i kept up with the sport but in michigan it's a lot different because you can go there and it's cool weather you know down here it's hot weather it's hard to get into football
sw04199-B_021947-022900 that really get you in the mood that late autumn sun and it's nice and cool and you can bring in some peppermint schnapps with you in the game [laughter] you know what i mean [noise]

sw04199-B_024670-025848 yeah but when you're there it doesn't seem that bad because everybody's all all real nice and everything and uh like i say you just take a little hip flask of peppermint schnapps or or something like that and everything goes real good [vocalized-noise] [noise]
sw04199-B_025848-026422 yeah you have like big tailgate parties there's like a golf course right near there and everybody uh has big tailgate parties you know that's
sw04199-B_026422-027821 get like a big bucket of kentucky fried chicken and eat that before the game and drink beers and stuff like that and you go on out and watch the game it's really neat then after the game ann arbor is such a nice town uh it's a big uh it's a football town in the fall i mean it's just an all college town all around it's real fun
sw04199-B_027821-028248 i don't go to school at university of michigan i went to uh western michigan university

sw04200-A_003198-003450 yeah sounds like it
sw04200-A_003450-004149 yeah a lot of people uh don't get any newspapers and you're getting two that's uh definitely kind of shows your interest in it [noise]
sw04200-A_004149-005148 so do you do that for uh because um the morning journal paper is got more of uh a liberal or type bias
sw04200-A_005148-005900 [noise]
sw04200-A_005900-006048 uh-huh
sw04200-A_006798-006949 um-hum
sw04200-A_007976-008125 um-hum
sw04200-A_008548-008671 right
sw04200-A_008777-009348 so the uh gwinnete paper that's owned by uh is it wall street journal
sw04200-A_009348-009547 new york times okay
sw04200-A_011098-011246 um-hum
sw04200-A_011772-011924 uh-huh
sw04200-A_013072-014100 um-hum so this something that you do uh just for your own personal interest it doesn't have anything to do with your job you're not in a job where you need to keep up on these current events
sw04200-A_014374-014528 okay
sw04200-A_015228-015372 uh-huh
sw04200-A_015499-015649 oh really
sw04200-A_015649-015873 you going to run for elected office
sw04200-A_016498-016627 uh-huh
sw04200-A_016726-017171 yeah that's good how did you do in you your first uh r- election
sw04200-A_017473-017621 um
sw04200-A_018071-018350 yeah for a third party right
sw04200-A_018350-019050 yeah and you probably uh you know more and more people are probably leaning toward that third party now the way things are going
sw04200-A_019050-019176 huh
sw04200-A_019380-019599 right hum
sw04200-A_019745-020574 uh i guess newspapers uh i get i subscribe to the morning [noise] the constitution um
sw04200-A_020574-020700 [noise]
sw04200-A_020700-021399 pub- uh journal publications for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in in terms of the work that i do
sw04200-A_021399-021549 um
sw04200-A_021549-022098 magazines us news and world report time magazine uh a lot of
sw04200-A_022200-023305 uh-huh yeah and you know things like sports illustrated uh computer magazines uh uh i don't know if you read the national review
sw04200-A_024149-024299 [laughter]
sw04200-A_024427-024577 oh wow
sw04200-A_024773-024899 um-hum
sw04200-A_025348-025500 sure
sw04200-A_025797-026078 i- i don't know what that is no
sw04200-A_026225-026349 um
sw04200-A_026823-026946 uh-huh
sw04200-A_027399-027528 um-hum
sw04200-A_029098-029600 um-hum so uh what you're in the you're an engineer
sw04200-B_000000-000097 [noise]
sw04200-B_000347-001229 well i- i subscribe to two different newspapers the gwinnete daily news and the journal so morning and afternoon and
sw04200-B_001229-002500 [noise] i guess that's where i get most of it and then i al- whenever i'm in the car i'm listening to w._g._s._t. or w._s._b. and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh
sw04200-B_002500-003546 uh i'm kind of addicted to headline news and c-span and c._n._n. so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers
sw04200-B_003999-004329 yeah [laughter] um
sw04200-B_005047-006000 oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the journal and the constitution i'd take the journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists
sw04200-B_006000-006299 um and also
sw04200-B_006299-007198 didn't want to take two morning papers and sin- since i live in gwinnete county i want to take the daily news to get their gwinnete coverage and it doesn't make sense to take two papers in the morning
sw04200-B_007198-008598 taking the journal in the afternoon means you're get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven a._m. or noon uh which you wouldn't get uh until the next day with the constitution
sw04200-B_009250-009476 well new york times
sw04200-B_009476-009680 and uh so
sw04200-B_009680-009720 [noise]
sw04200-B_009720-011149 it's kind of strange they they're they're they're generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the new york times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the new york times
sw04200-B_011149-011298 so it's
sw04200-B_011298-011601 uh they tend to be really
sw04200-B_011601-011849 uh really liberal
sw04200-B_011849-013182 uh and i- i- i actually think probably uncharacteristic for gwinnete county but it it's still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues
sw04200-B_013950-015276 well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics
sw04200-B_015276-015724 i'm you know active in politics and uh uh
sw04200-B_015827-016599 well i ran for state representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for state labor commission this year
sw04200-B_016599-016873 kind of ambitious but [laughter]
sw04200-B_017098-018425 well i um i- i was i run as a libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race
sw04200-B_018847-019472 well i hope so the way [laughter] that's becoming pretty clear that the other two aren't doing that great of a job
sw04200-B_019598-019849 so where do you get your news
sw04200-B_020377-020528 uh-huh
sw04200-B_021349-021498 uh-huh
sw04200-B_021820-021949 yeah
sw04200-B_021949-022275 yeah i subscribe to several magazines too
sw04200-B_022898-023022 um-hum
sw04200-B_023299-023836 i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh
sw04200-B_023836-024850 where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now i've got four kids and a fifth on the way now and it's hard to find time to read as much as i did
sw04200-B_024850-025427 so i've cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four
sw04200-B_025427-026900 things like uh uh reason which a lot of people don't even they don't even know what it is it's a it's a libertarian magazine but it's uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature
sw04200-B_026900-028326 and uh the freeman which is another uh libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing
sw04200-B_028326-029274 and uh oh a couple of others but uh i don't tend t- to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that
sw04200-B_029550-029795 yeah i work for uh uh
sw04201-A_000000-000227 [noise] what kind of car are you driving now
sw04201-A_000426-000699 uh-huh do you like that one
sw04201-A_000801-000948 uh-huh
sw04201-A_001571-001798 how long have you had it
sw04201-A_001798-002398 uh-huh my car that was the main problem i've ever had with it is
sw04201-A_002398-003370 i guess twice i've had to get the valve cover gasket replaced and once the gasket around the the um oil pan
sw04201-A_003370-003849 it's uh nineteen eighty two cutlass sierra
sw04201-A_003849-004300 and it still drives pretty well though i had kind of low mileage on it
sw04201-A_004900-005248 wow that's a lot of driving
sw04201-A_006099-006947 uh-huh i think that um i might've done better to get a pickup for the use that i've put mine to
sw04201-A_006947-007548 but um i didn't get it i didn't get that i got a car and that's
sw04201-A_007548-008446 there have been times when i was glad to have a car but most of the stuff i've done has been hauling around and i've been better off to have a pickup
sw04201-A_009098-009349 a full size pickup
sw04201-A_009748-009899 um-hum
sw04201-A_010224-010947 right what do you think you'll get a um step side or a a smooth split side
sw04201-A_011053-012031 yeah my daddy use used to always get a step side and because he has cows and the cows he can
sw04201-A_012031-012627 with a step side you can haul cows in the back because there aren't those humps for the tires
sw04201-A_012627-012800 but
sw04201-A_012800-013823 this last time he decided to still get a step side even though he couldn't find a step side in the long full length they only had them in the short length
sw04201-A_014100-015279 so he was disappointed in that but he still went with the step side because he thought it was easier to get in and around it and take things off the truck and so on without always having to come out the back
sw04201-A_015279-015947 but he uses it on the farm and he built himself a cow trailer so it he didn't need the length so much anymore
sw04201-A_017098-017597 do you just use it for your own purposes and hauling your family around
sw04201-A_019346-020148 right do you have if you're going to go camping are you going to have to drive you car to take your family camping plus drive the truck
sw04201-A_020999-021198 right
sw04201-A_021949-023047 well even though i could've probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring that'll be more useful in the future
sw04201-A_023047-023248 so
sw04201-A_023248-023699 i don't know i'll probably look for something that has a
sw04201-A_023699-024025 dealer everywhere i would like to drive
sw04201-A_024175-024478 that'll be the main criterion
sw04201-A_024478-025298 i guess the japanese makes though do are starting to have dealers all over though i don't know about how the hyundai dealer network is
sw04201-A_025871-026024 um-hum
sw04201-A_027247-027602 that's true that's a good point i remember
sw04201-A_027698-028500 a long time ago my folks got a chrysler but the nearest chry- chrysler dealer to them was over fifty miles away
sw04201-A_028500-029028 and it weren't all that good of a car they had pretty many trouble with it
sw04201-A_029028-029598 pretty much trouble so whenever it would break down and take it back to the dealer they'd have to
sw04201-A_029598-029808 to nurse it along
sw04201-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw04201-B_000099-000597 no i'm well driving a hyundai sonata
sw04201-B_000597-000850 no we like it real well
sw04201-B_000949-001600 yeah we haven't had the only problem we've had is the valve cover gasket leaking other than that it's been working real good
sw04201-B_001699-001898 uh two years
sw04201-B_003300-003450 um-hum
sw04201-B_004198-004996 yeah well this um like i said we've had this for two years and it almost got forty five thousand on it
sw04201-B_005098-005873 yeah wife does a lot of driving [noise] she she uses it a lot and then we have the second vehicle the
sw04201-B_005873-006127 nissan pickup
sw04201-B_006827-007050 [laughter]
sw04201-B_008328-008500 yeah
sw04201-B_008500-009226 well our next vehicle is going to be a a full size truck well we're kind of getting little
sw04201-B_009226-009826 yeah uh nissan is just a a mini truck
sw04201-B_009826-010348 and it's not real big for a family so [laughter]
sw04201-B_010798-011199 i'll probably get a fleet side
sw04201-B_012499-012746 yeah
sw04201-B_013776-014098 yeah that's that's all they make them in now i think
sw04201-B_014098-015249 [noise]
sw04201-B_015249-015398 yeah
sw04201-B_015850-016048 yeah
sw04201-B_016048-017148 yeah yeah like i say like i'm we're kind of moving out in a mini truck and into the full size will be the next one so
sw04201-B_017447-018226 oh yeah plus you know i help friends move here and there and stuff and we kind of
sw04201-B_018226-019449 getting to the point where it's it's we're going to do a lot of camping and stuff during the summertime and the mini truck just doesn't [laughter] work very well so
sw04201-B_020028-020298 oh no no um
sw04201-B_020298-020448 the
sw04201-B_020448-021101 what we'd probably do right now is just use the car and try to put everything in it that we can
sw04201-B_021101-021449 and then later on we're going to try to get a uh
sw04201-B_021449-021649 camper trailer
sw04201-B_021649-021899 once we buy a new truck
sw04201-B_022849-022973 yeah
sw04201-B_023326-023499 [noise]
sw04201-B_023925-024269 [laughter] oh yeah i can understand that
sw04201-B_024377-024548 yeah
sw04201-B_025200-025946 well its pretty good uh we had one and then he closed and now we got another one here right near us so
sw04201-B_025946-027300 it's it's all right uh like i said the only problem we really had with our car just a valve cover gasket leaking and since they fixed it under warranty it was we haven't had any problem with it
sw04201-B_028427-028599 yeah
sw04201-B_029000-029130 um-hum
sw04202-A_000000-000442 [noise] -ell doug what are they doing in your community in pennsylvania about recycling
sw04202-A_000929-001095 uh-huh
sw04202-A_002894-003048 uh-huh
sw04202-A_003048-003435 so the the people have to separate it out is that
sw04202-A_004503-004673 oh
sw04202-A_005294-005453 yeah
sw04202-A_005453-006045 how about at penn state do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing
sw04202-A_007987-008209 oh yeah
sw04202-A_008669-008752 oh
sw04202-A_009288-010000 well what i've uh learned about recycling is that it's almost impractical to recycle newspapers
sw04202-A_010000-010156 which is sad
sw04202-A_010156-011275 and and as a matter of fact i'm member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand
sw04202-A_011275-011594 the supply is there people are willing to do it
sw04202-A_011594-012455 but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of [vocalized-noise] used newspapers effective- cost effectively
sw04202-A_012455-012667 then it's not gonna happen
sw04202-A_012667-013366 and and there are whole huge warehouses in dallas full of used newspapers
sw04202-A_013366-014053 and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in texas where they can strip the ink off
sw04202-A_014053-014742 i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said
sw04202-A_014742-015485 uh the city of plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um
sw04202-A_015485-016006 glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too
sw04202-A_016006-016931 and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood yet but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh
sw04202-A_016931-017573 they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash
sw04202-A_017746-018708 yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you don't want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper
sw04202-A_018708-018947 which you can buy from the city
sw04202-A_018947-019405 and and they're great until it rains and then they start biodegrading
sw04202-A_019547-020138 but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch
sw04202-A_020138-021462 and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter [laughter]
sw04202-A_021462-021593 [laughter]
sw04202-A_021593-021689 but
sw04202-A_021689-021884 it's uh
sw04202-A_021884-023058 uh since they won't take any yard waste it's that's in plastic bags it's a little bit annoying when you're you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing
sw04202-A_023058-024177 and you don't have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you haven't bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves [laughter]
sw04202-A_024177-024314 [laughter]
sw04202-A_024314-025113 but uh i don't know i th- for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community
sw04202-A_025699-025936 um [vocalized-noise]
sw04202-A_025936-027215 i don't know about statewide i think i think in the dallas area there are few other uh suburbs plano's a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling
sw04202-A_027215-028419 but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled
sw04202-A_028704-028871 i mean
sw04202-B_000000-000032 [noise]
sw04202-B_000251-000389 okay
sw04202-B_000389-000708 well some stuff
sw04202-B_000708-001765 i go to penn state up here and the town recycles quite a bit actually they collect curbside
sw04202-B_001765-002111 gone the day that the garbage goes
sw04202-B_002111-003011 and they recycle um tin and aluminum cans and glass and newspaper basically
sw04202-B_003383-003549 um
sw04202-B_003549-004132 no actually the um garbage crew does that you just put a
sw04202-B_004132-005308 you know p- plastic recycling bin out on the curb every week and now except for having the paper bundled people don't really separate at all
sw04202-B_005885-006718 um yeah they do although there's just recently been a problem with them
sw04202-B_006718-007419 uh like saying that they weren't able to afford recycling everything anymore
sw04202-B_007419-008075 so that they um they stopped recycling newspaper on campus for instance
sw04202-B_008075-008649 they stopped recycling glass so they're only doing cans and white paper now
sw04202-B_008649-008940 which i think is kind of insane
sw04202-B_008940-009318 because it's really not that expensive
sw04202-B_009984-010180 um-hum
sw04202-B_010836-011055 yeah
sw04202-B_011217-011355 um-hum

sw04202-B_027846-027997 right
sw04202-B_028318-028556 ri- right because
sw04202-B_028742-029952 right the plan o- the state college originally was that the recycling would pay for itself and all that and the people's garbage rates would actually go down and of course if hasn't happened that way

sw04203-B_001997-002651 i guess not not to the extreme of wanting to to to drop out of society and not have credit cards and not have
sw04203-B_002651-003551 uh you know cars or cre- credit cards or anything uh uh i deal with it but i do considered that it has it's uh potential

sw04203-B_012752-013464 i mean there maybe maybe that kind of detail involved [noise] he may be called upon it may uh the next
sw04203-B_013464-014009 the next move is to have terminals in their in their uh cars

sw04203-B_014554-015661 that and and i well i in fact actually i consider radar detection to be sort of an invasion [laughter] i think that that uh we have uh entirely to much uh
sw04203-B_015661-015908 regulation i think that
sw04203-B_016151-017493 if you take the old philosophy of you know when you when you catch him you convict him that's a healthy philosophy then well we know that you are going to do it so were going to watch you all the time [laughter]
sw04203-B_017740-019075 well the thing is that even though [laughter] even though i will probably do that even though i am guilty uh if someone uses uh uh human judgement instead of just making the rules they find out that
sw04203-B_019075-019250 i don't [vocalized-noise]
sw04203-B_019250-019417 put any risk
sw04203-B_019417-019939 to other people in certainly not any any risk comparable to
sw04203-B_019939-020596 oh let's say granny out on sunday driving forty five and pulling into my lane when i'm beside her
sw04203-B_020596-020734 uh
sw04203-B_020734-021372 i could drive a hundred and ten and be safer than most of sunday drivers on their
sw04203-B_021372-022076 i mean i mean a hundred and ten relative to everybody driving fifty five that's how that's how bad of drivers are out there now that have license
sw04203-B_022076-022793 it's the other [vocalized-noise] uh problem of privacy i- i- i think uh i think that uh
sw04203-B_022793-023212 company's intend uh tend to have to much
sw04203-B_023212-023556 uh they want to know to much about you
sw04203-B_023556-023856 and i really think they are only right
sw04203-B_023856-024013 is
sw04203-B_024013-024275 weather or not i do my job [laughter]
sw04203-B_025701-025826 um-hum
sw04203-B_026298-026693 that yeah that that has been the present philosophy
sw04203-B_026693-027259 uh i think something that kind of bother me that this is not a pri- i don't think this is a privacy issue but i'm not sure
sw04203-B_027259-027817 uh i don't like morals uh people's uh
sw04203-B_027817-028149 i guess i should call it southern baptist morals [laughter]
sw04203-B_028149-028745 that determine whether or not someone can go to a club
sw04203-B_028745-029202 weather it it not that it's legal or not legal anymore now its
sw04203-B_029202-029339 uh
sw04203-B_029339-029757 and i- i give the the example is news club says that they just
sw04203-B_029757-029952 regulated by not allowing them
sw04204-A_000000-000118 [noise]

sw04204-A_001520-001618 hum
sw04204-A_001618-002242 you know am convince that um it's always cheaper to repair than replace
sw04204-A_002242-002635 and uh you know if you replace there are other reasons for doing it
sw04204-A_002635-003682 like you want you know m- my answer to a car is it's okay if it ugly um it ok- depending on the [vocalized-noise] there is a they're bunch of other things that okay that it is it got to be reliable there is no excuse for that
sw04204-A_003778-003963 [laughter]
sw04204-A_004075-004230 yeah yeah
sw04204-A_004230-005084 um-hum well safety is subjective i think um you know one person criteria of safety is maybe a little different from another person
sw04204-A_005084-005230 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-A_005661-006187 well the you know not reliable company it it will never start in which case extremely safe [laughter]

sw04204-A_007133-008132 um for a while i was a proponent of saab's and um i have had two of them and one was a tremendous one disappointment from a reliability view point
sw04204-A_008132-008331 and um
sw04204-A_008331-008712 basically i decided to get rid of it before the warranty ran out
sw04204-A_008712-009089 and i think i was cured of the european motoring mystic
sw04204-A_009089-009225 at that point

sw04204-A_010530-010678 guess i'm
sw04204-A_010678-011013 [noise]
sw04204-A_011013-012347 you know if it weren't for the reliability in every other respect the car was wonderful drove great ton of room very very safe but front wheel drive which with me a plus but i just kept having um string of minor malfunctions
sw04204-A_012347-013507 and um just the process of have to pay for these thing you know also now they increment is what hundred and fifty dollars two hundred fifty dollars every time you take it to a mechanic and touch it hundred dollars hundred doll- hundred dollars [laughter]
sw04204-A_013507-013704 [laughter]

sw04204-A_014823-015464 and i asked him you know you you repair them all what do you think is best kind of reliability and he kind of get a japanese car
sw04204-A_015464-015871 um that starting to fall out of fashion these days [laughter]
sw04204-A_016036-016113 uh
sw04204-A_016312-017222 yeah you know i'm convince that well you it kind of interesting is what i'm driving right now is a ford probe which is manufactured in a mazda factory in illinois

sw04204-A_017594-017769 [laughter]
sw04204-A_018223-018689 yeah it's fake it's fake because see i mean even if i i'm sure the um

sw04204-A_022014-022993 [laughter] very probably you know its um yeah i think the ideal of um yeah its interesting because you know the location um
sw04204-A_022993-023661 don't seem to uh you know y- you can work over several thousands of miles not like it once was
sw04204-A_023661-024201 [vocalized-noise] use use to be they req- uh penalty for [vocalized-noise] doing it but i don't think it's true any more
sw04204-A_024311-024434 and so
sw04204-A_024569-025475 yeah absolutely um you know but there may be other bigger factors so if you decide to replace this ten year old vehicle what is the prime contender right know

sw04204-A_028758-028876 um
sw04204-A_028876-029596 i happen the think the nine hundreds is a uh i like the nine hundred better it it had more of the saab weirdness which really attracted me [laughter]
sw04204-A_029717-029842 yeah
sw04204-A_029842-029991 um you know it's um
sw04204-B_000000-000024 [noise]

sw04204-B_001394-001712 put up with those headache or get something new
sw04204-B_002617-002706 [vocalized-noise]
sw04204-B_003613-004099 right that's number one well that and safety
sw04204-B_004099-004302 safe and reliable
sw04204-B_005064-005722 well i think yeah that's true but reliabi- you know if it's not reliable it's not safe
sw04204-B_006068-006664 [laughter] well may be not if you're on the trans alaska highway
sw04204-B_008697-008852 uh
sw04204-B_009188-010207 well the saab does have a lot of good features and the reliability is uh like one of the few things i worry about with saab
sw04204-B_010207-011009 no i haven't but uh you know lo- you know looking around it does seem like a roomy
sw04204-B_011009-011222 [vocalized-noise] good handling
sw04204-B_011400-011571 yeah exactly
sw04204-B_012291-012427 yeah
sw04204-B_013198-013360 oh yeah
sw04204-B_013360-013492 well that's
sw04204-B_013594-014023 yeah that's the other drawback of saab is that they are not really cheap
sw04204-B_015947-016376 oh yeah a lot of uh flag waving going on
sw04204-B_017187-017360 [laughter]
sw04204-B_017661-018335 well that's a serious problem if your concerned with that i don't think its possible to tell where things are built anyone
sw04204-B_019617-019853 oh yeah you know
sw04204-B_021455-022096 yeah its probably own by a european cou- company that's employing mexicans
sw04204-B_022245-022400 y- you know
sw04204-B_023700-023880 yeah it seems like a
sw04204-B_024297-024645 oh well transportation does still cost
sw04204-B_025474-026028 well uh i was i was actually thinking of the saab nine thousands
sw04204-B_026028-026396 but there's a there's a few other hatchbacks
sw04204-B_026396-026838 no well i have it a toyota and i like the toyota's
sw04204-B_026838-027089 it's a a supra
sw04204-B_027089-027571 so it handles really well so i'm reluctant to get anything that handles poorly
sw04204-B_027709-028164 um i drove a nine hundred about five y- years ago
sw04204-B_028164-028306 it was very nice
sw04204-B_028702-028858 uh
sw04204-B_029623-029878 yes uh i don't mind ugly
sw04204-B_029878-029991 in fact i really don't
sw04205-A_000000-000257 what are your views mister [vocalized-noise]
sw04205-A_002535-003186 well i'm just not really still not really sure why the war started
sw04205-A_003186-004406 uh there was a conflict with the vietnamese had conflict with the french i- [noise] i know that and they've been in a war like state for seems like most of
sw04205-A_004406-004977 the time that their countries been prospering so they're just award tarnation
sw04205-A_005670-005798 uh-huh
sw04205-A_006354-006477 uh-huh
sw04205-A_006846-006968 uh-huh
sw04205-A_009553-010612 does oil come into the equation all of that is there oil in that area see oil is a a motivating factor for most of the
sw04205-A_010612-010950 altercations that go on in the world
sw04205-A_011241-011390 exactly
sw04205-A_011979-012104 um-hum
sw04205-A_012940-013038 um-hum
sw04205-A_013426-013973 what about what do you think about strategic location just as
sw04205-A_013973-014255 if you think about it
sw04205-A_014255-015678 russia has cuba which is an island outside the united states and united states has japan that's right out side of cuba it it does vietnam have a any strategic location
sw04205-A_016401-016528 um-hum
sw04205-A_018381-018514 um-hum
sw04205-A_019306-019418 um-hum
sw04205-A_019951-020075 uh-huh
sw04205-A_020460-021022 i sort of believe that the vietnam because of the vietnam war and the
sw04205-A_021022-021899 the way that the united states exited from it that that has brought on other scrimmages and i- i thinks that that's
sw04205-A_021899-022153 some what related
sw04205-A_022153-022284 to the
sw04205-A_022284-022524 gulf war because
sw04205-A_022524-022949 it makes the american people keep safe face
sw04205-A_025207-025358 um-hum
sw04205-A_026709-026848 um-hum
sw04205-A_027210-027329 from
sw04205-A_027329-027446 um-hum
sw04205-A_027624-027975 um-hum is this is this something in your
sw04205-A_027975-028968 in your m- in your military training that that uh suggests that that is [vocalized-noise] a um procedure of the
sw04205-A_028968-029299 [noise] of the american way of war
sw04205-A_029563-029863 right is there you know like there
sw04205-B_000000-000033 [noise]
sw04205-B_000258-000598 uh [noise] i think vietnam war
sw04205-B_000712-000906 was justified
sw04205-B_000906-001124 but it was carried out badly
sw04205-B_001124-001402 unfortunately politician got a hold of it
sw04205-B_001402-001734 and it was a military victory but it was uh
sw04205-B_001734-002128 i'd say uh a political defeat
sw04205-B_002128-002502 wh- wh- what do you think about of world i mean the vietnam war
sw04205-B_004925-005255 [noise] no uh from what i remember was uh
sw04205-B_005255-005401 the french
sw04205-B_005401-005687 had a vietnam as a colony
sw04205-B_005687-005973 and then after the war world war i._i.
sw04205-B_005973-006072 uh
sw04205-B_006072-006409 vietnam wanted to become independent o- of france
sw04205-B_006409-006663 so they started an up rising and that was the french
sw04205-B_006663-006894 and oh chinese war
sw04205-B_006894-007158 and and uh basically
sw04205-B_007158-007842 v- vietnamese where beating the french so we took over because we had our containment policy
sw04205-B_007842-008145 and uh the north side of vietnam
sw04205-B_008145-008402 went to russia for military aid
sw04205-B_008402-008545 and so [noise] we didn't want
sw04205-B_008702-009113 so we didn't want [noise] vietnam [noise] become communist
sw04205-B_009113-009584 so that's why we started supporting the south viet- vietnamese that's how the war started
sw04205-B_010010-010225 uh
sw04205-B_010858-011580 but it's not necessarily oil i- i- i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i don't think they had that much of a natural
sw04205-B_011580-012304 to much natural resource it's just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didn't help the south vietnamese
sw04205-B_012304-012990 the north vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko
sw04205-B_012990-013290 so we didn't want that so we got into the war
sw04205-B_014674-014795 uh-huh
sw04205-B_015663-015825 uh [noise]
sw04205-B_015944-016229 actually i- i- i really haven't considered that much
sw04205-B_016229-016438 about a strategic location
sw04205-B_016607-016765 hum uh
sw04205-B_016904-017204 other than it being another country falling to the
sw04205-B_017204-017384 to pinkos or the communist
sw04205-B_017496-017695 no not to much real strategic
sw04205-B_017695-017825 location
sw04205-B_017825-017976 it's just
sw04205-B_017976-018749 uh for for russia to continue it has to expand if it doesn't expand it'll collapse
sw04205-B_018749-019033 so by doing our containment policy
sw04205-B_019033-019232 we're defeating
sw04205-B_019232-019338 russia
sw04205-B_019466-020018 i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best
sw04205-B_020018-020131 but
sw04205-B_020131-020393 that was our our little view then
sw04205-B_022942-023137 uh
sw04205-B_023266-023669 i- i- i agree partial with you the vietnam war made us loose
sw04205-B_023669-023967 loose faith uh politically
sw04205-B_023967-024301 and and th- and and to the fact that the american public
sw04205-B_024301-024544 can't stomach war or high causality
sw04205-B_024544-025302 so we aren't really steadfast in that regard but military we un- you know unquestionably quick ass in vietnam
sw04205-B_025401-025499 uh
sw04205-B_025624-025796 [noise] it might have had
sw04205-B_025796-026249 probably did have some re- repercussions towards now you know people do
sw04205-B_026359-026775 the enemy does know if the america takes high causality it will leave
sw04205-B_026775-026947 just like in uh
sw04205-B_027084-027675 uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out
sw04205-B_029290-029653 uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities
sw04206-A_000000-000194 how do you fill about drugs testing
sw04206-A_000810-000939 um-hum
sw04206-A_002155-002277 um-hum
sw04206-A_002508-002632 yeah
sw04206-A_003462-003567 um-hum
sw04206-A_004522-004781 well yeah i'm i'm more of the uh
sw04206-A_004781-005628 i'm kind of more against it than i am for it i- i think that people i think people should more be they should be judge on you know their performance and i
sw04206-A_005628-005889 i guess it kind of seems to me that's it kind of a
sw04206-A_005889-006045 you know
sw04206-A_006045-006673 the pos- you the test type thing that you know people should pay attention to how there employees are you know the supervisors
sw04206-A_006673-007247 should keep an eye on them i- i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum
sw04206-A_007985-008143 and
sw04206-A_008143-008446 it also kind of i mean
sw04206-A_008446-009047 i don't know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like it's um
sw04206-A_009047-009271 it's kind of a personal you know your
sw04206-A_009271-010052 checking you know your body and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can
sw04206-A_010052-010426 y- you know ge- get away with testing other things yeah exactly
sw04206-A_010601-010698 yeah
sw04206-A_010853-011101 i mean that's a drug as well it's just [laughter]
